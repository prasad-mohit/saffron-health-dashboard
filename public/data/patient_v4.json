This chapter will discuss those principles, the competencies necessary to implement case management functions, and the relationship between those functions and the substance abuse treatment continuum. For the purposes of discussion, case management and substance abuse treatment are presented as separate and distinct aspects of the treatment continuum, although in reality they are complementary and at times thoroughly blended.\n\n## Case Management Principles\n\n**Case management offers the client a single point of contact with the health and social services systems.** The strongest rationale for case management may be that it consolidates to a single point responsibility for clients who receive services from multiple agencies. Case management replaces a haphazard process of referrals with a single, well-structured service. In doing so, it offers the client continuity. As the single point of contact, case managers have obligations not only to their clients but also to the members of the systems with whom they interact. Case managers must familiarize themselves with protocols and operating procedures observed by these other professionals. The case manager must mobilize needed resources, which requires the ability to negotiate formal systems, to barter informally among service providers, and to consistently pursue informal networks. These include self-help groups and their members, halfway and three-quarter-way houses, neighbors, and numerous other resources that are sometimes not identified in formal service directories.\n\n**Case management is client-driven and driven by client need.** Throughout models of case management, in the substance abuse field and elsewhere, there is an overriding belief that clients must take the lead in identifying needed resources. The case manager uses her expertise to identify options for the client, but the client's right of self-determination is emphasized. Once the client chooses from the options identified, the case manager's expertise comes into play again in helping the client access the chosen services. Case management is grounded in an understanding of clients' experiences and the world they inhabit\u2014the nature of addiction and the problems it causes, and other problems with which clients struggle (such as HIV infection, mental illness, or incarceration). This understanding forms the context for the case manager's work, which focuses on identifying psychosocial issues and anticipating and helping the client obtain resources. The aim of case management is to provide the least restrictive level of care necessary so that the client's life is disrupted as little as possible.\n\n**Case management involves advocacy.** The paramount goal when dealing with substance abuse clients and diverse services with frequently contradictory requirements is the need to promote the client's best interests. Case managers need to advocate with many systems, including agencies, families, legal systems, and legislative bodies. The case manager can advocate by educating non-treatment service providers about substance abuse problems in general and about the specific needs of a given client. At times the case manager must negotiate an agency's rules in order to gain access or continued involvement on behalf of a client. Advocacy can be vigorous, such as when a case manager must force an agency to serve its clients as required by law or contract. For criminal justice clients, advocacy may entail the recommendation of sanctions to encourage client compliance and motivation.\n\n**Case management is community-based.** All case management approaches can be considered community-based because they help the client negotiate with community agencies and seek to integrate formalized services with informal care resources such as family, friends, self-help groups, and church. However, the degree of direct community involvement by the case manager varies with the agency. Some agencies mount aggressive community outreach efforts. In such programs, case managers accompany clients as they take buses or wait in lines to register for entitlements. This personal involvement validates clients' experiences in a way that other approaches cannot. It suits the subculture of addiction because it enables the case manager to understand the client's world better, to learn what streets are safe and where drug dealing takes place. This familiarity helps the professional appreciate the realities that clients face and set more appropriate treatment goals\u2014and helps the client trust and respect the case manager. Because it often transcends facility boundaries, and because the case manager is more involved in the community and the client's life, case management may be more successful in re-engaging the client in treatment and the community than agency-based efforts. For clients who are institutionalized, case management involves preparing the client for community-based treatment and living in the community. Case management can ensure that transitions are smooth and that obstacles to timely admissions into community-based programs are removed. Case management can also coordinate release dates to ensure that there are no gaps in service. The type of relationship described here is likely at times to stretch the more narrow boundaries of the traditional therapist-client relationship.\n\n**Case management is pragmatic.** Case management begins \u201cwhere the client is,\u201d by responding to such tangible needs as food, shelter, clothing, transportation, or child care. Entering treatment may not be a client priority; finding shelter, however, may be. Meeting these goals helps the case manager develop a relationship with and effectively engage the client. This client-centered perspective is maintained as the client moves through treatment. At the same time, however, the case manager must keep in mind the difficulty in achieving a balance between help that is positive and help that may impede treatment engagement. For example, the loss of housing may provide the impetus for residential treatment. Teaching clients the day-to-day skills necessary to live successfully and substance free in the community is an important part of case management. These pragmatic skills may be taught explicitly, or simply modeled during interactions between case manager and client.\n\n**Case management is anticipatory.** Case management requires an ability to understand the natural course of addiction and recovery, to foresee a problem, to understand the options available to manage it, and to take appropriate action. In some instances, the case manager may intervene directly; in others, the case manager will take action to ensure that another person on the care team intervenes as needed. The case manager, working with the treatment team, lays the foundation for the next phase of treatment.\n\n**Case management must be flexible.** Case management with substance abusers must be adaptable to variations occasioned by a wide range of factors, including co-occurring problems such as AIDS or mental health issues, agency structure, availability or lack of particular resources, degree of autonomy and power granted to the case manager, and many others. The need for flexibility is largely responsible for the numerous models of case management and difficulties in evaluating interventions.\n\n**Case management is culturally sensitive.** Accommodation for diversity, race, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and life stage (for example, adolescence or old age), should be built into the case management process. Five elements are associated with becoming culturally competent: (1) valuing diversity, (2) making a cultural self-assessment, (3) understanding the dynamics of cultural interaction, (4) incorporating cultural knowledge, and (5) adapting practices to the diversity present in a given setting ([Cross et al., 1989](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R44)).\n\n## Case Management Practice\u2014Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes\n\nAll professionals who provide services to substance abusers, including those specializing in case management, should possess particular knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which prepare them to provide more treatment-specific services. The basic prerequisites of effective practice include the ability to establish rapport quickly, an awareness of how to maintain appropriate boundaries in the fluid case management relationship, the willingness to be nonjudgmental toward clients, and certain \u201ctransdisciplinary foundations\u201d created by the Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) (see page 6). These foundations\u2014understanding addiction, treatment knowledge, application to practice, and professional readiness\u2014are articulated in 23 competencies and 82 specific points of knowledge and attitude. Examples of competencies include\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understanding a variety of models and theories of addiction and other problems related to substance use\n\n\u25aa\n:   Ability to describe the philosophies, practices, policies, and outcomes of the most generally accepted and scientifically supported models of treatment, recovery, relapse prevention, and continuing care for addiction and other substance-related problems\n\n\u25aa\n:   Recognizing the importance of family, social networks, and community systems in the treatment and recovery process\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understanding the variety of insurance and health maintenance options available and the importance of helping clients access those benefits\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understanding diverse cultures and incorporating the relevant needs of culturally diverse groups, as well as people with disabilities, into clinical practice\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understanding the value of an interdisciplinary approach to addiction treatment ([CSAT, 1998](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R37))\n\nEven though case managers have not always enjoyed the same stature accorded other specialists in the substance abuse treatment continuum, they must possess an equally extensive body of knowledge and master a complex array of skills in order to provide optimal services to their clients. Case managers must not only have many of the same abilities as other professionals who work with substance abusers (such as counselors), they must also possess special abilities relating to such areas as interagency functioning, negotiating, and advocacy. In recognition of the specific competencies applicable to conducting case management functions, two of the eight core dimensions\u2014referral and service coordination\u2014provide critical knowledge, skills, and attitudes pertinent to case management. Below are the activities covered under those dimensions.\n\n### Referral\n\n\u25aa\n:   Establish and maintain relations with civic groups, agencies, other professionals, governmental entities, and the community at large to ensure appropriate referrals, identify service gaps, expand community resources, and help to address unmet needs\n\n\u25aa\n:   Continuously assess and evaluate referral resources to determine their appropriateness\n\n\u25aa\n:   Differentiate between situations in which it is more appropriate for the client to self-refer to a resource and those in which counselor referral is required\n\n\u25aa\n:   Arrange referrals to other professionals, agencies, community programs, or other appropriate resources to meet client needs\n\n\u25aa\n:   Explain in clear and specific language the necessity for and process of referral to increase the likelihood of client understanding and follow-through\n\n\u25aa\n:   Exchange relevant information with the agency or professional to whom the referral is being made in a manner consistent with confidentiality regulations and professional standards of care\n\n\u25aa\n:   Evaluate the outcome of the referral\n\n### Service Coordination\n\n#### Implement the treatment plan\n\n\u25aa\n:   Initiate collaboration with referral source\n\n\u25aa\n:   Obtain, review, and interpret all relevant screening, assessment, and initial treatment-planning information\n\n\u25aa\n:   Confirm the client's eligibility for admission and continued readiness for treatment and change\n\n\u25aa\n:   Complete necessary administrative procedures for admission to treatment\n\n\u25aa\n:   Establish realistic treatment and recovery expectations with the client and involved significant others including, but not limited to\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Nature of services\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Program goals\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Program procedures\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Rules regarding client conduct\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Schedule of treatment activities\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Costs of treatment\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Factors affecting duration of care\n\n    \u22c4\n    :   Client rights and responsibilities\n\n\u25aa\n:   Coordinate all treatment activities with services provided to the client by other resources\n\n#### Consulting\n\n\u25aa\n:   Summarize the client's personal and cultural background, treatment plan, recovery progress, and problems inhibiting progress for purpose of ensuring quality of care, gaining feedback, and planning changes in the course of treatment\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understand terminology, procedures, and roles of other disciplines related to the treatment of substance use disorders\n\n\u25aa\n:   Contribute as part of a multidisciplinary treatment team\n\n\u25aa\n:   Apply confidentiality regulations appropriately\n\n\u25aa\n:   Demonstrate respect and nonjudgmental attitudes toward clients in all contacts with community professionals and agencies ([CSAT, 1998](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R37))\n\nAlmost 200 specific knowledge items, skills, and attitudes are associated with these dimensions: They can be found in [Appendix B](/books/n/tip27v2/appB/).\n\n## The Substance Abuse Treatment Continuum and Functions of Case Management\n\n### Substance Abuse Continuum of Care\n\nSubstance abuse treatment can be characterized as a continuum arrayed along a particular measure, such as the gravity of the substance abuse problem, level of care\u2014inpatient, residential, intermediate, or outpatient (Institute of Medicine, 1990)\u2014or intensity of service ([ASAM, 1997](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R5)). The continuum in this TIP is arranged chronologically, moving from case finding and pretreatment through primary treatment, either residential or outpatient, and finally to aftercare. Inclusion of case finding and pretreatment acknowledges the wide variety of case management activities that take place before a client has actually become part of the formal treatment process.\n\nWhile distinct goals and treatment activities are associated with each point on the continuum, clients' needs seldom fit neatly into any one area at a given time. For example, a client may need residential treatment for a serious substance abuse problem, but only be motivated to receive assistance for a housing problem. Case management is designed to span client needs and program structure.\n\n#### Case finding and pretreatment\n\nThe case-finding aspect of treatment is generally of paramount concern to treatment programs because it generates the flow of clients into treatment. Pretreatment has changed enormously in the past five years as programs have closed, resources have dwindled, and services available under managed care plans have been severely curtailed. Many individuals identified as viable treatment candidates cannot get through the gate, and pretreatment may in fact constitute brief intervention therapy. Treatment programs may undertake case-finding activities through formal liaisons with potential referral sources such as employers, law enforcement authorities, public welfare agencies, acute emergency medical care facilities, and managed care companies. Health maintenance organizations and managed care companies often require case finding when hotlines are called. General media campaigns and word of mouth also lead substance abusers to contact treatment programs.\n\nSome treatment programs operate aggressive outreach street programs to identify and engage clients. Outreach workers contact prospective clients and offer to facilitate their entry into treatment. Although treatment admission may be the foremost goal of the worker and the treatment program, prospective clients frequently have other requests before agreeing to participate. Much of the assistance offered by outreach workers resembles case management in that it is community-based, responds to an immediate client need, and is pragmatic.\n\nA pretreatment period is frequently the result of waiting lists or client reluctance to become fully engaged in primary treatment. In a criminal justice setting, it may be a time to prepare clients who are not ready for primary treatment because they do not have support systems in place and lack homes, transportation, or necessary work and living skills. The pretreatment period may be when clients lose interest in treatment. When the appropriate services are provided, however, it may actually increase the commitment to treatment at a later time. Numerous interventions\u2014role induction techniques, pretreatment groups, and case management\u2014have been instituted to improve outcomes associated with the pretreatment period ([Alterman et al., 1994](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R3); [Gilbert, 1988](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R54); [Stark and Kane, 1985](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R159); [Zweben, 1981](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R180)).\n\n#### Primary treatment\n\nPrimary treatment is a broad term used to define the period in which substance abusers begin to examine the impact of substance use on various areas of their lives. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) delineates five categories of primary treatment, characterized by the level of treatment intensity: early intervention, outpatient services, intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization, residential or inpatient services, and medically managed intensive inpatient services ([ASAM, 1997](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R5)). Whatever the setting, an extensive biopsychosocial assessment is necessary. This assessment provides both the client and the treatment team the opportunity to determine clinical severity, client preference, coexisting diagnoses, prior treatment response, and other factors relevant to matching the client with the appropriate treatment modality and level of care. If not already established during the case finding/pretreatment phase, this assessment should also consider the client's needs for various resources that case management can help secure.\n\n#### Aftercare\n\nAftercare, or continuing care, is the stage following discharge, when the client no longer requires services at the intensity required during primary treatment. A client is able to function using a self-directed plan, which includes minimal interaction with a counselor. Counselor interaction takes on a monitoring function. Clients continue to reorient their behavior to the ongoing reality of a pro-social, sober lifestyle. Aftercare can occur in a variety of settings, such as periodic outpatient aftercare, relapse/recovery groups, 12-Step and self-help groups, and halfway houses. Whether individuals completed primary treatment in a residential or outpatient program, they have at least some of the skills to maintain sobriety and begin work on remediating various areas of their lives. Work is intrapersonal and interpersonal as well as environmental. Areas that relate to environmental issues, such as vocational rehabilitation, finding employment, and securing safe housing, fall within the purview of case management.\n\nIf different individuals perform case management and addictions counseling, they must communicate constantly during aftercare about the implementation and progress of all service plans. Because case managers interact with the client in the community, they are in a unique position to see the results of work being done in aftercare groups and provide perspective about the client's functioning in the community. Recent findings suggest that the case management relationship may be as valuable to the client during this phase of recovery as that with the addictions counselor ([Siegal et al., 1997](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R151); [Godley et al., 1994](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R57)). Aftercare is important in completing treatment both from a funding standpoint (many funders refuse to pay for aftercare services), as well as from the client's perspective.\n\n### Case Management Functions and the Treatment Continuum\n\nIn this section, case management functions are presented against the backdrop of the substance abuse continuum of care to highlight the relationship between treatment and case management. The primary difference between the two is case management's focus on assisting the substance abuser in acquiring needed resources. Treatment focuses on activities that help substance abusers recognize the extent of their substance abuse problem, acquire the motivation and tools to stay sober, and use those tools. Case management functions mirror the stages of treatment and recovery. If properly implemented, case management supports the client as she moves through the continuum, encouraging participation, progress, retention, and positive outcomes. The implementation of the case management functions is shaped by many factors, including the client's place in the continuum and level of motivation to change, agency mission, staff training, configuration of the treatment or case management team, needs of the target population, and availability of resources. The fact that not all clients move through each phase of the treatment continuum or through a particular phase at the same pace adds to the variability inherent in case management.\n\n#### Engagement\n\n##### Case finding and pretreatment\n\nEngagement during the case finding/pretreatment phase is particularly proactive. The case manager frequently needs to provide services in nontraditional ways, reaching out to the client instead of waiting for the client to seek help. Engagement is not just meeting clients and telling them that a particular resource exists. Engagement activities are intended to identify and *fulfill* the client's immediate needs, often with something as tangible as a pair of socks or a ride to the doctor.\n\nThis initial period is often difficult. Motivation may be fleeting and access to services limited. In many jurisdictions, there is a significant wait to schedule an orientation, assessment, or intake appointment. Third parties responsible for authorizing behavioral health benefits may be involved, and client persistence may be a key factor in accessing services.\n\nAdditional factors may come into play with clients referred from the criminal justice system. They may be angry about their treatment by the criminal justice system and may resent efforts to help them. Clients who begin treatment after serving time in jail or prison have significant life issues that must be addressed simultaneously (such as safe housing, money, and other subsistence issues) as well as resentment, resistance, and anger. Others may have active addictions or be engaged in criminal activity. Requirements imposed by the criminal justice system must also be met; these can present conflicts with meeting other goals, including participation in substance abuse treatment.\n\nPotential clients may be unfamiliar with the treatment process. Their expectations about treatment may not be realistic, and they may know very little about substance abuse and addiction. It is not uncommon for people at this stage to minimize the impact substance use or abuse has on their lives. These factors often manifest in client behaviors such as missing appointments, continued use, excuses, apathy, and an unwillingness to commit to change.\n\nThe goal of case management at this stage is to reduce barriers, both internal and external, that impede admission to treatment. Client reluctance to enter into services can be reduced by (1) motivational interviewing approaches; (2) basic education about addiction and recovery; (3) reminding clients of past and future consequences of continued substance abuse; (4) assistance in meeting the client's basic survival needs; and (5) commitment to developing the case manager-client relationship. Prescreening for program eligibility, coordinating referrals, and working to reduce any administrative barriers can facilitate access to services.\n\nThe process of motivating a client, beginning the education process, identifying essential needs, and forming a relationship can begin during a prescreening or screening interview. The motivational approaches suggested by Miller and Rollnick encourage client engagement through exploratory rather than confrontational means ([Miller and Rollnick, 1991](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R98)). Recognizing that not every client enters treatment with the same motivational levels, they build on Prochaska and DiClemente's stages of motivation for treatment. The stages move from the client's non-recognition of a problem (precontemplation) to contemplation of a need for treatment, to determination, to action, and finally, to the maintenance of attained goals ([Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R121)). Case management can use this framework to engage the client with stage-appropriate services. This means that clients who have not decided to address their substance abuse can often be \u201chooked\u201d into more intensive treatment by providing basic practical supports. Providing these supports can have the additional effect of reducing the perceived desirability of continued substance use and the lifestyles associated with it.\n\nA structured interview provides the client the opportunity to discuss her drug use and history with the case manager and to explore the losses that may have resulted from that use. For some clients, this history may reveal a pattern of increasing loss of control (and perhaps loss of freedom). Review and discussion of losses can serve to motivate clients to proceed to treatment. Listening empathetically and showing genuine concern about a client's well-being can facilitate the beginning of a meaningful, supportive relationship between the client and the case manager and can serve to motivate the client as well. A good initial relationship between client and case manager can also be invaluable when the client experiences difficulties later on in treatment ([Miller and Rollnick, 1991](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R98)).\n\nIn addition to information regarding substance abuse and the treatment process, clients must be informed about requirements and obligations of the case manager or case management program, and about requirements they will be expected to meet once they are admitted to treatment. This type of discussion presents another opportunity to solidify the client's commitment to participate in treatment. Even at the earliest stages, clients should be reminded that permanent changes are necessary for recovery. Finally, any questions the client has should be addressed. This can be particularly important for clients referred by the criminal justice system, who may be somewhat confused about that system's requirements, the consequences of noncompliance, and the difficulties they encounter in meeting those requirements.\n\nWhile case management in the pretreatment phase may be intended to route clients to a particular program, engagement is not just a \u201ccome-on\u201d to treatment. Many prospective clients will not formally enter treatment within an agency-defined period, but, within flexible limits, case management services should still be made available to these individuals. The transition from engagement to planning is a gradual one and does not lend itself to agency-created distinctions such as \u201cpretreatment\u201d and \u201cprimary treatment.\u201d\n\n##### Primary treatment\n\nFor clients who elect to enter treatment, engagement serves to orient the client to the program. Orientation involves explaining program rules and regulations in greater detail than was possible or necessary during pretreatment. The provider elicits the client's expectations of the program and describes what the program expects of the client. The person responsible for delivering case management to a particular client is in a unique position to assist in the match between individual and treatment. During primary treatment, the case manager can serve as one of the client's links with the outside world, assisting the client to resolve immediate concerns that may make it difficult to focus on dealing with the goal of primary treatment\u2014coming to grips with a substance abuse problem.\n\nIn addition to orienting clients to treatment programs, case managers can orient treatment programs to the clients they refer. Sharing information gathered during the pretreatment phase can provide support for the treatment process that ensues upon program admission.\n\n##### Aftercare\n\nWhile in treatment, most of a client's time is spent dealing with substance use. Although discharge plans may have been considered, it is not until discharge that the day-to-day realities of living assume the most urgency. Because of their relationship with their clients and their community ties, case managers are well positioned to help clients make this delicate transition. Case management serves to coordinate all aspects of the client's treatment. This coordination occurs within a given treatment program, between the program and other resources, and among these other resources. The extent of the case manager's ability to work on the client's behalf will be guided both by the formal authority vested in the individual by the service providers involved and by the individual's informal relationships.\n\nThe case manager's extensive knowledge of the client's real-world needs can help the client who is no longer using. Clients in aftercare have an array of needs, including housing, a safe and drug-free home environment, a source of income, marketable skills, and a support system. Many have postponed medical or dental care; in recovery, they may seek it for the first time in years. Once an individual is in recovery, physician-prescribed medication for pain management can become a major problem, an issue that may require coordination and advocacy.\n\n#### Assessment\n\nThe primary difference between treatment and case management assessments lies in case management's focus on the client's need for community resources. The findings from the assessment, including specific skill deficits, basic support needs, level of functioning, and risk status, define the scope and focus of the service plan.\n\n##### Case finding and pretreatment\n\nDepending on the structure and mission of the program providing case management, assessment may begin when engagement begins. It is case management's role to explore client needs, wants, skills, strengths, and deficits and relate those attributes to a service plan designed to address those needs efficiently. If the client is not eligible for a particular case manager's program, the case manager links the client with appropriate external treatment resources. This process includes assessing the client's eligibility and appropriateness for both substance abuse and other services and for a specific level of care within those services. If the client is both eligible and appropriate for the program, the case manager's role is to engage the client in treatment.\n\n##### Primary treatment\n\nFor clients who enter primary treatment, the case management assessment function, which is primarily oriented to the acquisition of needed resources, is merged with an assessment that focuses on problems amenable to therapy\u2014substance use, psychological problems, and family dysfunction. Ideally both assessments are integrated into a biopsychosocial assessment ([Wallace, 1990](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R173)). This biopsychosocial assessment should, at a minimum, examine the client's situation in the life domains of housing, finances, physical health, mental health, vocational/educational, social supports, family relationships, recreation, transportation, and spiritual needs. Detailed information should be gathered on drug use, drug use history, health history, current medical issues, mental health status, and family drug and alcohol use. This assessment, used in conjunction with the needs assessment, assists the treatment team in developing a formal treatment plan to be presented to, modified, and approved by the client. Whether one person or several conduct these two assessments is largely irrelevant. Where a team approach exists, all members of the team, including the case manager or other professional identified in that role, should bring their expertise to the assessment. Discharge planning and long-range needs identification, particularly with current funding limitations, begins at treatment admission. Because of this, intensive case management for substance abuse clients, regardless of the level of care, is imperative.\n\nAs the individual responsible for coordinating diverse services, the case manager must take a broad view of client needs, look beyond primary therapy to the impact of the client's addiction on broader domains, and assess the impact of these domains on the client's recovery. He also must assess specific areas of functional skill deficits, including personal living skills, social or interpersonal skills, service procurement skills, and vocational skills. Individuals performing this function need to have strong knowledge of and experience in the field of substance abuse. The greater the number of problems the case manager can help the client identify and manage during primary treatment, the fewer problems the client must address during aftercare and ongoing recovery\u2014and the greater the chances for treatment success.\n\nA case management assessment should include a review of the following functional areas ([Harvey et al., 1997](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R60); [Bellack et al., 1997](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R13)). These items are not exhaustive, but demonstrate some of the major skill and service need areas that should be explored. The assessment of these areas of functioning gives evidence of the client's degree of impairment and barriers to the client's recovery. The case manager may have to perform many services on behalf of the client until skills can be mastered.\n\n#### Service procurement skills\n\nWhile the focus of case management is to assist clients in accessing social services, the goal is for clients to learn how to obtain those services. The client should therefore be assessed for\n\n\u25aa\n:   Ability to obtain and follow through on medical services\n\n\u25aa\n:   Ability to apply for benefits\n\n\u25aa\n:   Ability to obtain and maintain safe housing\n\n\u25aa\n:   Skill in using social service agencies\n\n\u25aa\n:   Skill in accessing mental health and substance abuse treatment services\n\n#### Prevocational and vocation-related skills\n\nIn order to reach the ultimate goal of independence, clients must also have vocational skills and should therefore be assessed for\n\n\u25aa\n:   Basic reading and writing skills\n\n\u25aa\n:   Skills in following instructions\n\n\u25aa\n:   Transportation skills\n\n\u25aa\n:   Manner of dealing with supervisors\n\n\u25aa\n:   Timeliness, punctuality\n\n\u25aa\n:   Telephone skills\n\nThe case management assessment should include a scan for indications of harm to self or others. The greater the deficits in social and interpersonal skills, the greater the likelihood of harm is to self and/or others, as well as endangerment from others. The case manager should also conduct an examination of criminal records. If the client is under the supervision of the criminal justice system, supervision officers should be contacted to determine whether or not there is a potential for violent behavior, and to elicit support should a crisis erupt.\n\n##### Aftercare\n\nThe client's readiness to reintegrate into the community is a focus of case management assessment throughout the treatment continuum. Because the case manager is often out in the community with the client, she is in an excellent position to evaluate this important indicator. During aftercare, her assessment may reveal new, recurring, or unresolved problems the client must deal with before they interfere with recovery. The potential for relapse is a particularly significant challenge, and the client must be able to identify personal relapse triggers and learn how to cope with them. Because case managers are familiar with the community, clients, and substance abuse treatment issues, they can spot such triggers and intervene appropriately. If, for example, a case manager fears that a client's decision to return to a familiar neighborhood could result in contact with drug-using friends that could jeopardize sobriety, a new residence may be necessary.\n\n#### Planning, goal-setting, and implementation\n\nFlowing directly and logically from the assessment process, planning, goal-setting, and implementation comprise the core of case management. Based on the biopsychosocial or case management assessment, the client and case manager identify goals in all relevant life domains, using the strengths, needs, and wants articulated in the assessment process. Service plan development and goal-setting are discussed in detail in numerous works on substance abuse and case management ([Ballew and Mink, 1996](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R10); [Rothman, 1994](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R140); [Sullivan, 1991](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R163)). These authors agree on several points: Each goal in service plans should be broken down into objectives and possibly into even smaller steps or strategies that are behaviorally specific, measurable, and tangible. Distinct, manageable objectives help keep clients from feeling overwhelmed and provide a benchmark against which to measure progress. Goals, objectives, and strategies should be developed in partnership with the client. They should be framed in a positive context\u2014as something to be achieved rather than something to be avoided. Time frames for completing the objectives and strategies should be identified. Abbreviated, user-friendly treatment planning templates make client participation in development of a service plan more likely. The availability of staff to assist in the planning, goal-setting, and implementation of the case management aspects of the treatment plan is crucial.\n\nSuccessful completion of an objective should provide the client the satisfaction of gaining a needed resource and demonstrating success. Failure to complete an objective should be emphasized as an opportunity to reevaluate one's efforts. In the latter situation, the case manager should be prepared to help the client come up with alternative approaches or to begin an advocacy process.\n\nA deliberate, carefully considered approach to identifying client goals offers benefits that go beyond the actual acquisition of needed resources. Clients benefit by\n\n\u25aa\n:   Learning a process for systematically setting goals\n\n\u25aa\n:   Understanding how to achieve desired goals through the accomplishment of smaller objectives\n\n\u25aa\n:   Gaining mastery of themselves and their environment through brainstorming ways around possible barriers to a particular goal or objective\n\n\u25aa\n:   Experiencing the process of accessing and accepting assistance from others in goal-setting and goal attainment\n\nThese and other individually centered outcomes make the planning and goal-setting process as important as the final outcome in some cases. This is the action stage of case management, when the client participates in many new or foreign activities and may have multiple requirements imposed by multiple programs or systems. Many significant and stressful transitions may be involved\u2014from substance use to abstinence, from institutionalization or residential placement to community reintegration, and from a drug- or alcohol-using peer group to new, abstinent friends. As clients struggle to stop using, many will relapse, sometimes after a significant period of abstinence. They may feel overwhelmed, and it is not uncommon for clients in recovery to experience feelings of isolation and depression as they develop new peer associations and lifestyle patterns, and come to grips with their losses. In addition, the very real pressures of finances, employment, housing, and perhaps reunifying with and caring for children can be very stressful.\n\n##### Case finding and pretreatment\n\nDuring the pretreatment phase the planning function of case management focuses on supporting clients in achieving immediate needs and facilitating their entry into treatment. Ideally, the professional implementing case management meets with the client to plan the goals and objectives for the service plan. While planning and goal setting are important in this early stage of treatment, it may be difficult to follow traditional approaches given the immediacy of clients' needs and the possibility that they are still using alcohol or other drugs. The case manager may decide to complete a formal plan after an action is undertaken and present it to the client as a summary of work that was accomplished. If a client's capacity is diminished by substance abuse and the presence of multiple, serious life problems, the case manager may have to delay teaching and modeling for the client, and instead trade on his own contacts, resources, and abilities. As the client progresses through the treatment continuum, the case manager can turn more and more of the responsibility for action over to the client.\n\nClients who are using addictive substances while receiving case management services present a significant dilemma for the case manager. On the one hand, the client may not be willing or able to participate in treatment; on the other, treatment providers normally expect some commitment to sobriety before clients begin the treatment process. As a result, the case manager frequently needs to negotiate common ground between client and program.\n\nFor example, a case manager might require the client to identify and make progress toward mutually understood goals pending entry into treatment. Structured correctly, such an approach fosters a win-win situation. Attainment of these goals either eliminates the client's need for treatment or prepares him to accept treatment more willingly. Even if the client is unwilling or unable to achieve those goals, the case manager and treatment program have additional information to use in attempting to motivate the client to seek treatment.\n\n##### Primary treatment\n\nDuring primary treatment, the case manager and client develop a service plan that identifies and proposes strategies to meet the client's short- and medium-term needs. The case management plan should reflect the level and intensity of the service along with the client's specific objectives. Virtually all clients have multiple needs; consequently, the service plan should be structured to enable clients to focus on addressing their problems *while* they participate in treatment. The idea that one can put lack of housing, employment issues, or a child's illness aside to concentrate exclusively on addiction treatment and recovery is unrealistic and sets up both the treatment provider and the client for failure. At the same time, it is often necessary for the client and case manager to prioritize problems.\n\nDuring primary treatment, the case manager must (1) continue to motivate the client to remain engaged and to progress in treatment; (2) organize the timing and application of services to facilitate client success; (3) provide support during transitions; (4) intervene to avoid or respond to crises; (5) promote independence; and (6) develop external support structures to facilitate sustained community integration. Case management techniques should be designed to reduce the client's internal barriers, as well as external barriers that may impede progress.\n\nProviding ongoing motivation to clients is critical throughout the treatment continuum. Clients need encouragement to commit to entering treatment, to remain in treatment, and to continue to progress. The case manager must continually seek client-specific incentives. Clients are encouraged by different factors, and the same client may respond differently depending on the situation. For instance, many clients referred by the criminal justice system will be initially motivated to try treatment in order to avoid a jail sentence; they may be motivated to stay in treatment for very different reasons (e.g., they start to feel better, they hope to regain custody of children). The treatment process is difficult, and many clients become discouraged after their initial enthusiasm. Recovery may require them to explore uncomfortable issues. Physical discomfort, as well as depression, can ensue. Case managers can provide support during these periods by supplying information on coping techniques such as exercise, diet, and leisure activities. If depression is significant, case managers can work with substance abuse counselors to have a mental health evaluation conducted, and, if appropriate, enable the client to seek additional therapeutic support for the depression. Continued empathetic caring can also motivate clients.\n\nDisincentives may also be used. For example, the case manager might remind clients of the outcome of terminating treatment\u2014for some, this might mean a return to prison, for others it might mean dealing with the health or safety consequences of addictive behaviors. For clients under the control of the criminal justice system, sanctions, including possible jail stays, may be necessary to regain commitment and motivation.\n\nIn criminal justice settings, particularly drug courts, regular \u201cstatus hearings\u201d before a judge may motivate the client. In status hearings, the judge is informed of the client's progress (or lack thereof), and engages the client in a dialogue. The judge can then apply rewards (encouragement, or reduction of criminal sanctions), adjust treatment requirements, or apply sanctions. Sanctions vary, but may include warnings, community service, short jail stays, or ultimately, termination from the program and incarceration.\n\nAnother fundamental role of case management during the active treatment phase is to coordinate the timing of various interventions to ensure that the client can achieve his goals. The case manager has to work with the client to balance competing interests, and to develop strategies so the client can meet basic survival needs while in treatment. For example, a case manager may have to negotiate between probation and treatment to ensure that the client can attend treatment sessions and meet with his probation officer. Some activities require staging to ensure that they are applied at the right time and in the correct order. Clients who are unemployed and lack employment skills, for instance, should begin job readiness and training activities after they are stabilized in treatment; they will need additional support for seeking and maintaining employment. It is not uncommon for clients to feel they can take on the world once they are stabilized in treatment. If this is the case, the job of the case manager is to encourage clients to go slowly and take on responsibility one step at a time. This can be particularly critical for women anxious to reconnect with their children. The financial and emotional responsibilities are great, and the case manager should work with the woman and child protective services to transition these responsibilities in manageable ways.\n\nTransition among programs\u2014from institutional programming to residential treatment; from residential treatment to outpatient; or to lower level services within an outpatient setting \u2014 is always stressful, and frequently triggers relapse. In order to avoid crises during transitions, case managers should intensify their contact with clients. Case managers should work to ensure that service is not interrupted. When possible, release dates should be coordinated to coincide with admission to the next program.\n\nIf the client is under the control of the criminal justice system, the case manager should work to ensure that supervision activities remain the same or increase when treatment activity decreases. Too frequently, a client completes a treatment program and is moved to a lower level of supervision at the same time. This pulls out support all at once. If possible, supervision and treatment activities should be coordinated to promote gradual movement to independence in order to reduce the likelihood of relapse.\n\nIn addition to activities designed to avoid a crisis or relapse, the case manager should be available to respond to relapses and crises when they do occur. In many cases, the case manager leads the response effort. Case managers should be in frequent contact with the treatment program to check on client attendance and progress. Lapses in attendance and/or poor progress can signal an impending crisis, and a case conference should be held. The case conference can resolve problems and prevent the client's termination from the program. While violence toward staff or other patients is obviously adequate grounds for immediate program termination, other infractions do not necessarily warrant expulsion. The case management team and client should work together to develop alternatives that will keep the client engaged in treatment. If removal from the program is absolutely necessary, it may be possible to have the client readmitted after he \u201cadjusts his attitude\u201d and re-commits to treatment and to obeying the rules.\n\nThe Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) Project has developed a special form of case conference, known as \u201cjeopardy meetings\u201d for treatment clients involved in the criminal justice system. These meetings are attended by the case manager, treatment counselor, probation officer, client, and anyone else involved in the case. The purpose of the meeting is to confront the client with the problem, and to discuss its resolution as a team. The client must agree to the proposed resolution in writing. The jeopardy meeting provides a clear warning to the client (three jeopardy meetings can result in client termination); reduces the \u201ctriangulation\u201d or manipulation that can occur if all parties aren't working in a coordinated fashion; and brings together the skills and resources of multiple agencies and professionals. (For more on jeopardy meetings, including structure and format, see the *TASC Implementation Guide* ([Bureau of Justice Assistance, 1988](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R25)).\n\n##### Aftercare\n\nOne of the anticipatory roles for case management during primary care is to plan for aftercare, discharge, and community reentry. During primary care and into aftercare, the case manager helps the client master basic skills needed to function independently in the community, including budgeting, parenting, and housekeeping. Short-term goals increasingly become supplanted by long-term goals of integrating the individual into a recovery lifestyle. When appropriate, service plans should reflect an ever-increasing emphasis on clients' accepting greater responsibility for their actions. The case management intervention may increase or decrease in intensity, depending on client response to independence and progress toward community reintegration.\n\n#### Linking, monitoring, and advocacy\n\nSome findings suggest that while persons with substance abuse problems are generally adept at accessing resources on their own without case management, they often have trouble using the services effectively ([Ashery et al., 1995](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R9)). This is where the linking, ongoing monitoring, and, in many cases, advocacy, of case management can be valuable. An additional crucial function of case management is coordinating all the various providers and plans and integrating them into a unified whole.\n\nLinking goes beyond merely providing clients with a referral list of available resources. Case managers must work to develop a network of formal and informal resources and contacts to provide needed services for their clients.\n\n##### Case finding and pretreatment\n\nCase managers may be especially active in providing linking and advocacy during the pretreatment phase of the treatment continuum. As with each of the case management functions, the roots of linking begin much earlier, while conducting an assessment with the client and in creating goals in which the client is vested. The authors of one primer on case management identify five tasks related to linking that should be undertaken with the client before actual contact with a needed resource even occurs. Case managers must (1) enhance the client's commitment to contacting the resource; (2) plan implementation of the contact; (3) analyze potential obstacles; (4) model and rehearse implementation; and (5) summarize the first four steps for the client ([Ballew and Mink, 1996](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R10)).\n\n##### Primary treatment\n\nAfter the linkage is made, the case manager moves on to monitoring the fit and relationship between client and resource. Monitoring client progress, and adjusting services plans as needed, is an essential function of case management. Coupled with monitoring is the need to share client information with relevant parties. For instance, if a client who is involved in the criminal justice system tests positive for drugs, both the treatment counselor and the probation officer may need to know. If the case manager is aware that the client is having problems at work, this information may need to be shared with the treatment provider, within the constraints of confidentiality regulations.\n\nCase managers who are responsible for offenders in treatment may oversee regular drug testing. This is an effective way to obtain objective information on a client's drug use, as well as to structure boundaries for the client to help prevent relapse.\n\nMonitoring may reveal that the case manager needs to take additional steps on the client's behalf. Simply put, *advocacy* is speaking out on behalf of clients. Advocacy can be precipitated by any one of a number of events, such as\n\n\u25aa\n:   A client being refused resources because of discrimination, whether discrimination is based on some intrinsic aspect of the client, such as gender or ethnicity, or on the nature of the client's problems, such as addiction\n\n\u25aa\n:   A client being refused services despite meeting eligibility requirements\n\n\u25aa\n:   A client being discharged from services for reasons outside the rules or guidelines of that service\n\n\u25aa\n:   A client being refused services because they were previously accessed but not utilized\n\n\u25aa\n:   The case manager's belief that a service can be broadened to include a client's needs without compromising the basic nature of the service\n\nAdvocacy on behalf of a client should always be direct and professional. Advocacy can take many forms, from a straightforward discussion with a landlord or an employer, to a letter to a judge or probation officer, to reassuring the community that the client's recovery is stable enough to permit reentry. Advocacy often involves educating service providers to dispel myths they may believe about substance abusers, or ameliorating negative interactions that may have taken place between the client and the service provider. This is particularly important for certain groups with whom some programs are reluctant to work, such as clients with AIDS/HIV or clients involved in the criminal justice system.\n\nMore complicated advocacy involves, for example, appealing a particular decision by a service staff member to progressively higher levels of authority in an organization. The highest, most involved levels of advocacy include organizing a community response to a particular situation or initiating a legal process. Modrcin and colleagues provide an advocacy strategy matrix that can help case managers systematically plan advocacy efforts ([Modrcin et al., 1985](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R100)). In this view of advocacy, the levels at which advocacy can be effected (individual, administrative, or policy) are weighed against varying approaches (positive, negative, or neutral). Three guidelines for advocating on behalf of a client are getting at least three \u201cNo's\u201d before escalating the advocacy effort, understanding the point of view of the organization that is withholding service, and consulting with supervisory personnel regularly before moving to the next level of advocacy ([Sullivan, 1991](/books/n/tip27v2/appA/#R163)).\n\nClient advocacy should always be geared toward achieving the goals established in the service plan. Advocacy does not mean that the client always gets what she wants. Particularly for clients whose continued drug use or cessation of treatment will present considerable negative consequences such as incarceration or death, advocacy may involve doing whatever it takes to keep them in treatment, even if that means recommending jail to get them stabilized. It is not uncommon, in fact, for clients to state their preference for jail when treatment gets difficult. Even when advocating for clients, the case manger must respect system boundaries. For example, a case manager might negotiate hard to keep an offender client in community-based treatment, but agree to inform the probation office of positive drug tests or suspected criminal behavior. While advocacy for certain client populations is essential, concern for the client should not override goals of public safety. Effective, client-centered advocacy may put the case manager in a position of conflict with co-workers, program administrators, or even supervisors. Case managers who advocate for an extension of benefits for their clients may put themselves and their supervisors in jeopardy with funding sources. A coordinated infrastructure with existing policies and procedures for client centered collaboration will help.\n\n#### Disengagement\n\nDisengagement in the case management setting, as with clinical termination, is not an event but a process. In some ways, the process begins during engagement. For both client and case manager, it entails physical as well as emotional separation, set in motion once the client has developed a sense of self-efficacy and is able to function independently. To a significant degree, this decision can be based on progress defined by the service plan. If the plan has truly been developed with the client's active involvement, there will be a great deal of objective information that will help both the case manager and client decide when disengagement is appropriate. It is preferable that disengagement be planned and deliberate rather than have the relationship end in a flurry of missed appointments, with no summary of what has been learned by the client and professional. Formal disengagement gives clients the opportunity to explore what they learned about interacting with service providers and about setting and accomplishing goals. The case manager has a chance to hear from clients what they considered beneficial\u2014or not beneficial\u2014about the relationship. Reviewing and summarizing client progress can be an important aspect of consolidating clients' gains and encouraging their future ability to access resources on their own.\n\n[Copyright Notice](/books/about/copyright/)\n\nThis is an open-access report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain License.

In 2017, more than 2 million people had alcohol-associated cirrhosis in the US. Alcohol-associated liver disease is the primary cause of liver-related mortality and the leading indication for liver transplant, representing 40% to 50% of all liver transplant in high-income countries.\n\n**Observations:** Steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis are the 3 pathologic findings that are associated with progression to cirrhosis, with highest risk in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The amount and duration of alcohol consumption, female sex, obesity, and specific genetic polymorphisms such as patatin-like phospholipase domain protein 3, membrane bound O-acyltransferase, and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 genes are risk factors for alcohol-associated liver disease progression. Ten-year survival of patients with alcohol-associated liver disease is 88% among those who are abstinent and 73% for those who relapse to alcohol consumption. Symptomatic alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by rapid onset of jaundice and a 30% risk of mortality 1 year after diagnosis. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined as a modified discriminant function score greater than or equal to 32 or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (starts at 6 and capped at 40; worst = 40) greater than 20, is associated with the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure and multiorgan failure. Corticosteroid therapy is associated with improved 1-month survival from 65% in untreated patients to 80% in treated patients. Early liver transplant may be appropriate in highly select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to medical therapy. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant should be considered if the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score remains greater than 17 after 3 months of alcohol abstinence. Between 2014 and 2019, the proportion of patients waiting for liver transplantation who had alcohol-associated liver disease increased from 22% to 40%. Alcohol-associated cirrhosis accounted for approximately 27% of 1.32 million deaths worldwide related to cirrhosis in 2017.\n\n**Conclusions and relevance:** Alcohol-associated liver disease is among the most common liver diseases and more than 2 million people in the US in 2017 had alcohol-associated cirrhosis.

Retrieved [date graphic was accessed], from https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health\n\nSocial determinants of health (SDOH) have a major impact on people\u2019s health, well-being, and quality of life. Examples of SDOH include:\n\n* Safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods\n* Education, job opportunities, and income\n* Access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities\n* Discrimination and violence\n* Polluted air and water\n* Language and literacy skills\n\nSDOH also contribute to wide health disparities and inequities. For example, people who don't have access to grocery stores with healthy foods are less likely to have good nutrition. That raises their risk of health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity \u2014 and even lowers life expectancy relative to people who do have access to healthy foods.\n\nJust promoting healthy choices won't eliminate these and other health disparities. Instead, public health organizations and their partners in sectors like education, transportation, and housing need to take action to improve the conditions in people's environments.\n\nThat's why Healthy People 2030 has an increased and overarching focus on SDOH.\n\n## How Does Healthy People 2030 Address SDOH?\n\nOne of Healthy People 2030\u2019s 5 overarching goals is specifically related to SDOH: \u201cCreate social, physical, and economic environments that promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being for all.\u201d\n\nIn line with this goal, Healthy People 2030 features many objectives related to SDOH.

As premature death from acute illness is reduced, the prevalence of conditions that accumulate over time rises, particularly in a world in which greater exposure to unnatural environ-ments increases long term vulnerability to ill health. Chronic illness, whether resulting from infections (increasingly viral or fungal), external injuries, develop-mental abnormalities, autoimmune defects, genetic susceptibilities, or cellu-lar degeneration, are a product of multiple in\ufb02uences on health. No longer is there a culpable \u2018agent\u2019 of disease causation, and \u2018disease\u2019 itself is no longer a straightforward concept.\nDiseases, after all, are professionally de\ufb01ned entities without clear biological representations. They can be and are arti\ufb01cially created to suit special interests, and the sum of deaths due to speci\ufb01c diseases in the world exceeds the actual number of deaths. As the case-fatality rate of speci\ufb01c disease decreases, multi-morbidity is the result; diseases now rarely exist in isolation in individuals.\nMoreover, diseases are but one manifestation of illness; impaired comfort from symptoms, impaired activity from anatomical and physiological derangements, and impaired cognitive and emotional function from biological and psycho-social dysfuntions are legitimate concerns for individuals, subpopulations, and populations.\nFrom the viewpoint of health systems organization, it is well to remember that William Farr, in his contributions to thinking underlying the International Classi\ufb01cation of Diseases, set in motion the reigning paradigm that equates ill health with disease, separates person-focused manifestations of health problems with disease-focused ones, and separates primary care from secondary (\u2018specialist\u2019) care. The organization of this Classi\ufb01cation determined how phys-icians would be trained and what they would practise \u2013 a useful orientation when health services were faced with speci\ufb01c diseases in speci\ufb01c contexts. New recognition of the multiplicity of in\ufb02uences on health, the variability in vulner-ability and resilience of different individuals and population groups to threats to illness, and the emerging crisis of harm from iatrogenic causes is calling into question the adequacy of health systems to deal in conventional ways with illness burdens of people and populations. It may even call into question the adequacy of conventional ways of classifying illness.\nThe current focus on chronic care management is one approach to dealing with this rapidly changing challenge of describing and understanding \u2018disease\u2019 in the 21st century. Whether it is the appropriate one remains to be seen.\nA disease oriented approach to global health will almost certainly worsen global inequities, because socially disadvantaged people have greater burdens of dis-eases of all types. Eliminating or controlling diseases one by one is not likely to materially reduce the chances of another in vulnerable populations. It may also be unconscionable when the most serious shortfalls in achieving the Millennium Development Goals are in maternal and child health. Good primary care, which focuses on ALL health conditions with a comprehensive array of services, may be a much better approach to achieve equity in health as well as overall improvement in health.\nIn this excellent summary of challenges and approaches to dealing with chronic disease in Europe, the editors have done yeoman\u2019s work in setting the stage for widespread deliberation of the issues in diseased-focused care. Some chapters frankly advocate (without evidence) for a focus on \u2018chronic disease\u2019 rather than on person-focused care with responsiveness to person-de\ufb01ned needs and priorities. But the introductory chapter and summary, as well as many of the other chapters provide a balanced view; the review indicates a lack of evidence of bene\ufb01t of a focus on speci\ufb01c chronic diseases. We are still a long way away from knowledge, wisdom and political will to achieve effective, equitable, and ef\ufb01cient health services systems that improve the health of populations and subpopulations.\nProfessor Barbara Star\ufb01eld MD, MPH John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health April 2008 Foreword xvii Foreword II In the history of mankind few, if any, pandemics will have led to as much suffering and premature deaths as is emerging from the global epidemic of chronic disease. A combination of prevailing life-style factors including diet, lack of physical activity and smoking have contributed to the rising incidence of chronic disease in all parts of the globe, accounting for the majority of premature deaths in all but the lowest income countries. The speed at which obesity, diabetes and vascular disease have become common causes of death in societies which, only a generation ago, were struggling with signi\ufb01cant levels of under-nutrition, illustrates the speed at which social and cultural change has impacted health. Even at current levels, the impact of chronic disease is profound, but more worrisome is that all predictions indicate that the preva-lence of these diseases is likely to grow, particularly in middle income countries, substantially increasing the overall burden of these diseases.\nAll countries will need to manage this very substantial healthcare burden better as the potential impact of these diseases on economic growth in these countries is very signi\ufb01cant. At the level of individual families, the loss of a parent from chronic disease can have profound consequences on the family unit. In the workplace, employers will need to carry the increasing \ufb01nancial burden of chronic disease, and society as a whole, particularly through health-care systems, will need to understand better how to deal with this emerging problem. Healthcare providers have not yet found mechanisms to adapt to the chronic disease burden either by developing disease prevention pro-grammes or disease management pathways suitable for chronic rather than acute disease. More novel and creative approaches to public health will be needed if we are to amend the societal and cultural factors that underlie most if not all these diseases.\nThis book represents a very timely contribution to our understanding of the scale and impact of chronic disease and, in particular, provides important insights into approaches to care pathways for such patients. For clear reasons of focus, it has concentrated on the healthcare management structures in Europe for chronic disease, but many of these lessons will apply widely around the world. It considers not simply the burden of disease in human terms, but also the clear economic impact on families, business and governments and makes a compelling case for a change in the approach of healthcare systems to help deal with this serious emerging problem. These diseases require an important mix of both appropriate healthcare provision and disease prevention strategy and this balance is carefully considered in this volume.\nThis book represents an important call to action \u201cfor all those involved in healthcare systems and public health\u201d. Many of the existing structures within our healthcare systems are highly inappropriate for most chronic diseases and few serious attempts have been made to manage many of the lifestyle factors that have created this epidemic in the \ufb01rst instance. Governments, employers, healthcare providers and individuals need to be attentive to the main messages in this important volume. The pace at which this epidemic is gathering momentum suggests we have little time to waste.\nProfessor Sir John Bell Regius Professor of Medicine, University of Oxford and President Academy of Medical Sciences Foreword xix Acknowledgements This volume is one of a series of books produced by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

Greater longevity, \u201cmodernization\u201d of lifestyles, with increasing exposure to many chronic disease risk factors, and the growing ability to intervene to keep people alive who previously would have died have combined to change the burden of diseases confronting health systems.\nChronic conditions are de\ufb01ned by the World Health Organization (WHO) as requiring \u201congoing management over a period of years or decades\u201d and cover a wide range of health problems that go beyond the conventional de\ufb01nition of chronic illness, such as heart disease, diabetes and asthma. They include some communicable diseases, such as the human immunode\ufb01ciency virus and the acquired immunode\ufb01ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), that have been transformed by advances in medical science from rapidly progressive fatal conditions into controllable health problems, allowing those affected to live with them for many years. They also extend to certain mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, to de\ufb01ned disabilities and impairments not de\ufb01ned as diseases, such as blindness and musculoskeletal disorders (WHO 2002), and to cancer, the subject of a separate volume published by the European Observatory (Coleman et al. 2008). While others have offered different de\ufb01nitions for chronic illness (Conrad and Shortell 1996; Unwin et al. 2004), the common theme is that these conditions require a complex response over an extended time period that involves coordinated inputs from a wide range of health professionals and access to essential medicines and monitoring systems, all of which need to be optimally embedded within a system that promotes patient empowerment.\nYet healthcare is still largely built around an acute, episodic model of care that is ill-equipped to meet the requirements of those with chronic health problems.\nChronic conditions frequently go untreated or are poorly controlled until more serious and acute complications arise. Even when chronic conditions are recog-nized, there is often a large gap between evidence-based treatment guidelines and current practice. For example, McGlynn et al. (2003) demonstrated that only approximately 45% of service users with diabetes who had accessed healthcare in the United States by the end of the 1990s had received the recommended care; this proportion was somewhat higher for patients with congestive heart failure, but, at 64%, still suboptimal. Similarly, a systematic review of quality of clinical care in general practice in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom found that, even in the best-performing practices only 49% of patients with diabetes had had undergone routine foot examinations and only 47% of eligible patients had been prescribed beta blockers after heart attack (Seddon et al. 2001).\nIn response to the emerging challenge posed by chronic diseases, several countries have experimented with new models of healthcare delivery that can achieve better coordination of services across the continuum of care. Yet although better coordination of care delivery has a logical appeal, the available evidence on the value of different approaches remains uncertain (Conrad and Shortell 1996; Ouwens et al. 2005). Furthermore, the diversity of European healthcare systems means that there is unlikely to be a universal solution to the challenges posed by chronic disease. What may be possible in one healthcare system may be impossible, at least in the short term, in another ostensibly similar system if the two differ in critical aspects. Each system must \ufb01nd its own solution, although it can also draw on the lessons learned by others.\nThis book aims to support this process by systematically examining some of the key issues involved in the care of those with chronic conditions. It explores potential implications for different stakeholders in chronic care so as to identify contextual, organizational, professional, funding and patient-related factors that enable or hinder implementation of strategies to address chronic condi-tions. It aims to provide a platform for identifying best practices and the pre-requisites for implementing them.\nThe challenges Advances in healthcare that keep people alive while controlling, although not curing, their conditions have led to growing numbers of people surviving with chronic illness. At the same time, the proportion of older people in the popula-tion is also growing, further increasing the number of those with chronic health problems because of accumulated exposure to chronic disease risk factors over their lifetime. The consequences are not trivial. In 2006, 20% to over 40% of the population in the European Union aged 15 years and over reported a long-standing health problem and one in four currently receives medical long-term treatment (TNS Opinion & Social 2007). There are also a growing number of people with multiple health problems. These are most common among older people, with an estimated two-thirds of those who have reached pensionable 2 E. Nolte and M. McKee age having at least two chronic conditions (van den Akker et al. 1998; Wolff et al. 2002; Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Altersfragen 2005).\nThe implications for health systems and society as a whole are considerable.\nPeople with chronic health problems are more likely to utilize healthcare, par-ticularly when they have multiple problems. For example, in England, people with chronic illness account for 80% of general practice consultations and approximately 15% of people who have three or more problems account for nearly 30% of inpatient days (Wilson et al. 2005). Chronic diseases place a substantial economic burden on society. Estimates for the United States place the costs of chronic illness at around three-quarters of the total national health expenditure (Hoffman et al. 1996). Some individual chronic diseases, such as diabetes, account for between 2 and 15% of national health expenditure in some European countries (Suhrcke et al. 2005).\nChronic conditions have become vastly more complex to manage as new, more potent, but also often potentially more hazardous, drugs become avail-able. However, these drugs are often being given to people whose character-istics, in particular their age, would have excluded them from the trials that demonstrated their effectiveness (Britton et al. 1999). It is not known whether evidence about many medications can be generalized to the types of patient that have been excluded from trials because of their age or health problems (Tinetti et al. 2004). Thus, the disparities between results reported in trials and those obtained in routine clinical practice mean that much of the reputed evi-dence base for clinical decisions is of limited value (Hampton 2003). A further complication is that many people with chronic illness will be receiving treat-ment for several conditions and will thus be consuming a complex combination of pharmaceutical preparations whose combined ef\ufb01cacy and scope for inter-action have never been adequately tested. In Europe, between 4 and 34% of people aged 65 years and older use \ufb01ve or more prescription medications (Junius-Walker et al. 2007). Boyd et al. (2005) showed how, by following exist-ing clinical practice guidelines, a hypothetical 79-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, hypertension and osteoarthritis would be prescribed 12 separate medications, a mixture that risks multiple adverse reactions among drugs and diseases. The consequences of a complex medication regimen can be illustrated by the case of a 76-year-old woman with heart failure (Jelley 2006): \u201c[L]ater she developed diabetes . . . we controlled her blood pressure with tablets which worsened her renal function. A statin lowered her cholesterol, but her liver function went haywire . . . Beta blockers made her breathing worse and her warfarin had to be stopped after a gastric bleed . . . there always seemed to be a new symptom or drug side effect to deal with. . . .\u201d The risk of adverse drug reactions increases with multiple (co-)morbidities, the use of some types of drug (e.g. warfarin) and the number of drugs taken (Hajjar et al. 2007). The use of multiple medications also increases the risk of inappropri-ate prescribing: among adults with two or more chronic conditions, between one-\ufb01fth and a quarter (from 16% in Germany to 32% in the United States) reported a medical or medication error such as wrong dosage, wrong medication or erroneous laboratory tests (Schoen et al. 2007). Multiple medications may Caring for people with chronic conditions: introduction 3 increase the risk of problems associated with ageing, such as cognitive impair-ment and falls (Hajjar et al. 2007), and increases in complexity of treatment regimens has been associated with substantially lower adherence, further impair-ing effective treatment (WHO 2003).\nWhile these factors highlight the challenges facing patients, carers and health professionals alike in managing chronic health problems, multimorbidity per se is only one facet of patient complexity, which also re\ufb02ects determinants beyond biological factors that impact on health status and in\ufb02uence the effectiveness of speci\ufb01c treatments, such as socioeconomic, cultural and environmental factors and patient behaviour (Safford et al. 2007). Consequently, while patient com-plexity can be challenging when addressing treatment goals for one condition, it will become ever more complex when attempting to prioritize treatment targets for multiple conditions (Ritchie 2007).\nThe goals of chronic care are not to cure but to enhance functional status, minimize distressing symptoms, prolong life through secondary prevention and enhance quality of life (Grumbach 2003). It is clear that these goals are unlikely to be accomplished by means of the traditional approach to healthcare that focuses on individual diseases and is based on a relationship between an individual patient and a doctor. While it is equally clear that what is needed is a model of care that takes a patient-centred approach by working in partnership with the patient and other healthcare personnel to optimize health outcomes, it is much more dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne the best model. Each approach is highly dependent on context, with terminology used in one setting having a quite different meaning in another one. Therefore, many organizational interven-tions, such as stroke units, are evaluated as \u201cblack boxes\u201d, in which the inter-vention is de\ufb01ned by the name given to it, often with little understanding about the critical factors for success or failure.\nChronic illness confronts patients with a spectrum of needs that requires them to alter their behaviour and engage in activities that promote physical and psychological well-being, to interact with healthcare providers and adhere to treatment regimens, to monitor their health status and make associated care decisions, and to manage the impact of the illness on physical, psychological and social functioning (Clark 2003). Yet, increasing responsibility taken by patients for self-management can create particular challenges for those with multiple conditions, as they may experience aggravation of one condition by treatment of another. For example, a patient with chronic respiratory disease may struggle to adhere to exercise programmes designed for their diabetes (Bayliss et al. 2003).\nPatients vary in their preferences for care and the importance they place on health outcomes. Thus, some will prioritize maintenance of functional independence over intense medical management while others will be willing to tolerate the inconvenience and risk of adverse effects associated with complex multiple medication regimens if this is linked to longer survival, even if at the expense of quality of life (Tinetti et al. 2004). The ability of patients to develop individualized treatment plans is, therefore, of critical importance for effective care. The growth of the consumer society, coupled with the explosion in infor-mation available on the Internet, is creating more empowered patients, a phe-nomenon acting to increase the responsiveness with which health services are 4 E. Nolte and M. McKee delivered. However, this may also compromise equitable access to care, as the digital divide enables those who are most privileged to take greatest advantage of the new opportunities provided while those in most need are left behind (Stroetmann et al. 2002). The situation is exacerbated as populations change, with increased global migration creating groups who, despite the goal of uni-versal coverage, may fall between the cracks, especially if their migration has been illegal (Healy and McKee 2004). Unfortunately, our understanding of the scale and nature of any impact of these changes on access to care remains limited.\nThe shifting balance of care Taken together, these developments can be seen as evidence of a growing com-plexity of healthcare. They are in\ufb02uencing profoundly the way that healthcare is being delivered. These in\ufb02uences can be considered under several headings (Royston 1998).\nFirst, the growing opportunities for early intervention, coupled with a greater recognition in some countries of the bene\ufb01ts of reducing the burden of disease as a means of relieving pressure on health systems, is shifting the balance between treatment and prevention. In the United Kingdom, for example, a 2002 Treasury study on future needs for healthcare constructed a variety of scenarios differing largely in the extent to which the health of the population improves. The difference in costs in 2022 between the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios was approximately \u00a330 billion (\u000150 billion), approximately half of the 2002 National Health Service (NHS) expenditure (Wanless 2002). Yet the issue is not one of simply shifting resources from treatment to prevention; rather it is one of \ufb01nding ways to integrate the two, with prevention strate-gies that take full advantage of developments in healthcare while reorienting healthcare to embed prevention at all stages.\nSecond, there is a changing balance between hospitals and alternative care settings (Hensher and Edwards 2002). Hospitals have the advantage of con\ufb01-ning the patient in one place, waiting for a series of investigations or a sequence of treatments to be undertaken. The patient is seen when it is convenient for the healthcare providers. Organizationally, this makes it easy to deliver complex packages of care, but it also brings major disadvantages for the patient, whose liberty is restricted. Even for those people requiring continuing care, hospitals may not be the most appropriate setting to receive it. Patients with advanced cancer may be better placed in a hospice; those with moderate disabilities may be able to manage better in their own homes but with enhanced nursing or other support. Again, this introduces a degree of complexity, as the needs of the patient are assessed and alternative modes of care provided.\nThird, there is a changing balance in the degree of professional and patient involvement in care. In a less-deferential society, patients are less willing to accept instructions without explanations. At the same time, it is recognized that many chronic conditions where the course of the disease may be labile, such as asthma or diabetes, require signi\ufb01cant participation by informed patients (Wagner et al. 1996). This, in turn, calls for support from healthcare providers to Caring for people with chronic conditions: introduction 5 inform and enable patients to self-manage their illness and may also necessitate an ongoing collaborative process between patients and professionals to optimize long-term outcome.\nFourth, as already noted, there is a changing balance between evidence and intuition in the clinical encounter, with a growing quest for evidence to under-pin clinical practice, and for mechanisms to ensure that the evidence is acted upon, that performance is assessed and action taken to improve it. This balance is, however, dynamic as initial enthusiasms for protocol-driven care confront the reality of individual patient characteristics, thus exposing the limits of determinism (McKee and Clarke 1995).\nFifth, in the face of evidence of growing inequities in societies, there is the shifting balance between services that simply respond to demand and those that proactively seek need, even when it is not voiced as demand, in the knowledge that those whose needs are greatest may be least able to access the care that they need.\nSixth, there is the growing potential of information technology. Patients accustomed to booking holidays or shopping on the Internet are increasingly puzzled by the continuing reliance on postal communication by health services.\nIn theory, booking an appointment should be easy. Yet there is a crucial differ-ence. The Internet model of holiday booking, involving the booking of a set of return tickets and a hotel, is analogous to a single episode of care, for example an attendance for a routine medical examination. However, the traveller in search of a tailor-made holiday, visiting a sequence of destinations suited to his or her individual needs, and using a variety of travel modes (a model more analogous to a patient with a multiple chronic diseases), will require the services of travel agent. Given that most patient journeys more closely resemble the bespoke holiday market, it is unsurprising that healthcare information systems often struggle to deliver what they promise.\nFinally, there is the challenge of developing a workforce to respond to the changing healthcare environment. This is a vast area, drawing together many of the previous six issues but added to by the problem of how to provide training in the increasingly diverse settings for healthcare.\nConceptual framework To explore the challenges outlined above, the study will use a conceptual frame-work that draws, broadly, on the Chronic Care Model (CCM) developed by Wagner and colleagues (1999). This model presents a structure for organizing healthcare to improve outcomes among patients with chronic illness and will be described in detail in Chapter 4. In brief, the model comprises four interacting system components considered key to providing good care for chronic illness: self-management support, delivery system design, decision support and clini-cal information systems. These are set in a health system context that links an appropriately organized delivery system with complementary community resources and policies.\nClearly, issues related to chronic illness that can be addressed under each of these headings are potentially boundless and our aim is not to duplicate work 6 E. Nolte and M. McKee that has already been undertaken, such as the increasing volume of reviews of the effectiveness of the different components of the CCM that form part of many disease management and related care programmes (see for example (Renders et al. 2001; Bodenheimer et al. 2002; Weingarten et al. 2002; Ofman et al. 2004; Ouwens et al. 2005; Tsai et al. 2005; Zwar et al. 2006). Instead, we use the headings to examine in depth some of the key features related to the growing complexity of healthcare that have so far received less attention.\nThe focus of the study is on the health system/services arrangements for people with established chronic health problems/diseases. Consequently, con-tributions to this book are based on chronic conditions/diseases, de\ufb01ned (using the WHO de\ufb01nition) as requiring ongoing management over a period of years or decades, and where there may be intercurrent acute episodes associated with a chronic condition or other acute illnesses. We consider all activities that stretch from minimizing the probability that those with risk factors will develop established chronic disease all the way through to the management of highly complex cases, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. The focus is on the healthcare sector, and social and/or community service models are only discussed where there is an integrative link with healthcare and/or they provide useful lessons learnt.\nThe ensuing work has evolved from a process of analysis at two levels, similar to previous Observatory studies, such as our recent work on Human Resources for Health (Dubois et al. 2006; Rechel et al. 2006). On one level, a series of key themes are examined, based on a synthesis of the theoretical and empirical evidence from a wide range of mostly high-income countries. On a second level, detailed analyses have been undertaken in individual countries that examine approaches to chronic illness care in different healthcare settings; these are published in a companion volume (Nolte et al. 2008).\nFigure 1.1 Health system activities covered in this book.\nSource: Adapted from Petersen and Kane 1997.\nCaring for people with chronic conditions: introduction 7 Outline of the book Given the breadth and complexity of the topic, it is important to say what this book is not. It is not a practical manual on how to implement a disease man-agement programme, \ufb01rst because there are many such guides elsewhere but, second, and more importantly, a key lesson from the analyses presented in this book is that the differing contexts in which people work require that solutions be tailored to national circumstances. Instead, we set out the evidence about what has been found to work, or not work, in different circumstances in the hope that this will be of use to those engaged in tackling the challenge of com-plex chronic disease. In contrast to some other volumes on often quite speci\ufb01c aspects of chronic disease, therefore, we have taken a broad perspective, setting the context within which policies are being made, addressing the prerequisites for effective policies and examining how decisions made for other purposes, such as how to pay for healthcare, may impact on managing chronic disease.\nThe book is divided into three broad sections. The \ufb01rst sets out the epidemi-ological evidence on the changing burden of chronic disease in the European region and explores the economic case for investing in chronic disease man-agement. The second section examines some of the key challenges posed by the rising complexity of healthcare, including prevention, using headings adapted from the CCM. The third section looks at the role of the broader health sys-tem, examining systems for \ufb01nancing chronic care and how the overall policy environment enables or hinders the introduction and implementation of effect-ive approaches to chronic care.\nLooking in more detail, Chapter 2 examines the burden of chronic disease facing the European region. It pays particular attention to morbidity patterns, drawing together epidemiological data on leading chronic conditions, such as stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and selected mental disorders, such as depression. One key challenge the chapter highlights is that of identifying reliable, appropriate and comparable data that allow for a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease across the European region and that can inform local and national policies. It argues that changing demographic patterns and increasing evidence on the health and societal costs of chronic diseases make it crucial to overcome the methodological challenges in assessing and monitoring the chronic disease burden.\nChronic diseases pose a sizeable burden for national economies, with some studies estimating the associated costs at up to 7% of a country\u2019s gross domestic product (Oxford Health Alliance Working Group 2005). This is partly a result of direct medical costs, from increased utilization of health services, medication and potentially costly interventions (e.g. Jonsson 2002; Reynolds et al. 2004) but also re\ufb02ects indirect costs, for example through decreased work productivity (Oxford Health Alliance Working Group 2005). Chapter 3 explores the eco-nomic and business case for tackling chronic disease, in order to provide the evidence base required for an informed debate weighing the costs associated with coordinated care programmes (Congressional Budget Of\ufb01ce 2004) against the expected societal bene\ufb01t. A key concern is an observed disconnect between the economic and the business case, which is likely to result in the provision 8 E. Nolte and M. McKee of what is, from a societal perspective, a suboptimal level of active chronic disease management if not addressed by appropriate \ufb01nancing and delivery mechanisms.\nChapter 4 explores approaches to addressing the healthcare needs of those with chronic health problems. It reviews different approaches to chronic care, which have variously been described as \u201cintegrated care\u201d, coordinated care\u2019, \u201cmanaged care\u201d, \u201cdisease management\u201d, \u201ccase management\u201d, \u201cpatient-centred care\u201d, \u201cchronic (illness) care\u201d, \u201ccontinuity of care\u201d and others. It then describes selected theoretical frameworks and existing delivery models designed to pro-vide care to those with varied levels of need. It goes on to examine the evidence base, taking advantage of the accumulating evidence on the relative effective-ness of different models and component features of chronic care (Bodenheimer et al. 2002; Weingarten et al. 2002; Ouwens et al. 2005; Singh 2005a; Singh and Ham 2006).\nAlthough this book is mainly concerned with the management of chronic disease, it is clear that an effective response includes preventing chronic diseases from occurring in the \ufb01rst place. The leading risk factors are mostly known, and so are effective interventions to reduce exposure; yet the response to the chal-lenge remains inadequate in many countries (Yach et al. 2004). Chapter 5 pro-vides an overview of trends in the leading determinants of chronic diseases and provides examples of effective prevention efforts in both the clinical and the population-based context. It illustrates how prevention is truly \u201ceveryone\u2019s business\u201d, with government, the private sector, the healthcare system and the individual patient all having substantial responsibilities for applying evidence-based prevention to the growing burden of chronic diseases.\nChronic illness confronts patients with a spectrum of needs that requires them to alter their behaviour and engage in activities that promote physical and psychological well-being, to interact with healthcare providers and adhere to treatment regimens, to monitor their health status and make associated care decisions, and to manage the impact of the illness on physical, psychological and social functioning (Clark 2003). Chapter 6 explores approaches to engage and/or empower patients towards self-management. It describes theoretical approaches that underpin many self-management support interventions and analyses the nature and effectiveness of self-management support in chronic disease, highlighting the challenges of providing such support to people with multiple conditions or those disadvantaged because of their ethnic or socio-economic background. It identi\ufb01es a clear need for more research to understand better the impact of support programmes on health outcomes and on the sus-tainability of improvements over the long term. It also shows that, while self-management support is recognized as an important element of chronic care, few countries seem to be developing or implementing systematic strategies to pro-mote this process. This underlines how important it will be for health policy makers, insurers and providers to create systems that enable all patients to manage their conditions effectively as part of a coordinated strategy.\nIt has been suggested that the key to effectively controlling chronic disease is the creation of systems that involve many different professionals and specialists working as teams to ensure that the right patients get the right type of care at the right time (Norris et al. 2003; Singh 2005b). Yet while the bene\ufb01ts for patients Caring for people with chronic conditions: introduction 9 may be obvious, it is less clear how restructuring of the delivery system impacts on those who have to implement it, namely the healthcare workers. Chapter 7 explores the crucial role of human resources in the provision of essential services to people with long-term conditions. It examines consequences of organiza-tional restructuring for the composition and deployment of the healthcare workforce as well as the impact on job design and work practices (e.g. role substitution, job expansion, job diversi\ufb01cation, team work, skill mix). It illus-trates key levers that can motivate change and enable the successful and sustainable implementation of approaches to chronic care from a workforce perspective. These include conceptualizing a human resources continuum, where service users take a key role, rede\ufb01ning professional roles, developing generic competencies and recon\ufb01guring the practice environment.\nAn important component of chronic disease management is decision support that will help healthcare providers to ensure effective treatment (Wagner et al.\n1996). Chapter 8 shows how decision support embraces a broad array of inter-ventions, increasingly reliant on electronic systems for their delivery, with the common purpose of increasing the quality of chronic disease care through the standardization of the delivery of care in accordance with best evidence-based practice while containing costs. It focuses in particular on computerized clinical decision support systems, identifying evidence of gains in both quality and safety of care associated with such systems. It notes the many challenges sys-tems are facing in implementing these systems, highlighting the implications for, for example, funders of health services, who will have to balance the costs related to the use of new technologies and new activities against the rather uncertain knowledge about whether these new expenditures will be offset by savings elsewhere in the system.\nThe CCM recognizes that \u201cimprovement in the care of patients with chronic illness will only occur if the system leaders . . . make it a priority and provide the leadership, incentives and resources necessary to make improvements happen\u201d (Epping-Jordan et al. 2004). Chapter 9 sets out the different means by which funders can pay for healthcare, exploring the theoretical advantages and dis-advantages of each approach while recognizing the rather more limited evidence base. It then considers the organizational facilitators and barriers to setting up those payment systems that will be expected to achieve optimal results before moving on to look in detail at the lessons emerging from the few evaluations that have been conducted, primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nChapter 10 concludes by exploring existing challenges to better coordination and integration, seeking to identify ways of overcoming them. Examining the various approaches taken by different countries, it identi\ufb01es three key elements that ought to be in place for an effective response to chronic disease: sustained \ufb01nancing, skilled and motivated health professionals, and supportive informa-tion systems. However, it also \ufb01nds that putting these elements in place will not be suf\ufb01cient in itself. The complexity of chronic diseases and the poten-tial responses to them mean that solutions will not emerge spontaneously but instead require a comprehensive, consistent and contextually appropriate framework that ensures that the necessary actions are taken to recon\ufb01gure organizational structures, remove barriers to change, and invest in training and 10 E. Nolte and M. McKee information technology. Success is not impossible, but the dif\ufb01culties should not be underestimated.\nThe audience for this book Few people will go through life unaffected by chronic disorders, whether as sufferers, informal carers, health professionals and managers, or developing pol-icies in the health and other sectors. This book will, inevitably, be of most interest to the last two groups, but we hope that there will also be something useful in it for the others. The nature of healthcare is changing, in many cases quite rapidly. Yet many health systems are still con\ufb01gured in ways that are more appropriate for the demands of the mid twentieth century rather than the mid twenty-\ufb01rst. Effective responses will require initiatives at all levels to ensure that the right resources (skilled staff, technology, pharmaceuticals and knowledge) can be assembled in the right place at the right time, while establishing support and incentives for everyone to work together to achieve this shared aim. There are no easy answers, and those working in different health systems must \ufb01nd models that are appropriate to their own circumstances. Yet there is also con-siderable scope for shared learning from each other\u2019s successes (and failures).\nThis book, and the companion volume of case studies, seek to contribute to this process.\nReferences Bayliss, E.A., Steiner, J.F., Fernald, D.H., Crane, L.A. and Main, D.S.

McKee chapter two The burden of chronic disease in Europe Joceline Pomerleau, C\u00e9cile Knai and Ellen Nolte Introduction Chronic diseases pose a major challenge to population health in Europe and worldwide. They are an important cause of premature mortality and, because they also cause disability, they have a major impact on the expectancy of life lived in good health. As populations age and new treatments allow those with once fatal diseases to survive, the prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in many countries (Yach et al. 2004). This is particularly the case in Europe, where fertility rates are declining; as a consequence there is now a much higher proportion of the population living with chronic diseases and, in many cases, multiple diseases.\nSeveral reports have assessed the burden of disease in Europe and elsewhere (WHO 2005a; WHO Regional Of\ufb01ce for Europe 2005b; Mathers and Loncar 2006). This chapter seeks to advance existing work, focusing on selected chronic conditions, to provide a broad picture while highlighting the key challenges involved in quantifying the burden of chronic disease. It will draw on a wide range of data sources, thereby promoting a better understanding of the availa-ble evidence. Although the focus of this chapter will be on the European region, we will refer to other high-income countries where appropriate. We conclude by discussing strategies to overcome some of the current methodological challenges in assessing the disease burden.\nAssessing the disease burden: the challenge One of the main challenges in assessing the disease burden is the relative lack of comparable and representative data. Assessments often have to draw, to a considerable extent, on mortality data as these are routinely available in most countries. However, mortality data only capture those causes of disease that have a fatal outcome and inevitably underestimate the burden of disease attri-butable to conditions that rarely cause death, such as mental illness, or that may not be listed as the immediate cause of death but which contribute to mortality, such as diabetes (Jougla et al. 1992).\nAttempts to overcome these limitations have involved the development of summary indicators such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) which com-bine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes, advanced mainly by the Global Burden of Disease study (Murray et al. 2002). DALYs essen-tially represent the sum of years of life lost and years of life lived with disability; the burden of disease measures the gap between the current health status of a given population and an ideal situation where everyone in the population lives to old age in full health.1 It makes it possible to estimate the contribution of different health problems, including chronic diseases, to the overall disease burden in a given population.\nIn practice, burden of disease assessments tend to focus on major disease categories only, often using broad classi\ufb01cations such as non-communicable diseases (NCD), communicable diseases and injuries, and/or selected disease categories within these, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or HIV/ AIDS (Mathers and Loncar 2006). Yet, although the term \u201cchronic disease\u201d might be interpreted as a component of NCDs, these two categories are by no means identical.2 Thus, NCDs also include a range of conditions that are not considered \u201cchronic\u201d (i.e. acute conditions) while chronic diseases may also include selected communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS. It, therefore, remains a challenge to assess the burden of chronic disease in the European region based on existing data sets.\nAgainst this background, we do not attempt in this chapter to portray the total burden of chronic disease in Europe. Instead, we focus on a few selected conditions, chosen because of the multiple challenges they pose to health sys-tems. On this basis we have included cerebrovascular disease, an important contributor to the burden of death and disease and a major cause of long-term disability; diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of which is predicted to increase dramatically in the next few decades; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, the former being the fourth leading cause of death in the world yet still underrecognized and asthma constituting the most common chronic disease in children (Pauwels and Rabe 2004); and unipolar depressive disorders, which are projected to become the second major con-tributor to the disease burden worldwide by 2020. We acknowledge that this selection excludes other important chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, dementia, arthritis or renal failure; this is mainly a result of the dif\ufb01culty in obtaining reliable and comparative data, a problem we illustrate for congest-ive heart failure (Box 2.1) and dementia (Box 2.2, below). We also recognize the importance of socioeconomic factors in relation to the disease burden; it is often greater among those at the lower end of the social scale (Marmot et al. 1991, 2001; Kaplan and Keil 1993). However, constraints on space and, most import-antly, limitations on data availability in many European countries precluded us from examining this aspect in detail.\n16 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte Population ageing and chronic disease Before examining in detail the burden of selected chronic conditions, it is important to emphasize that the burden of disease worldwide is dynamic (Mathers and Loncar 2006). One factor is the changing age structure of the population. In many populations, the number of old people, and especially the very old, is increasing. For Europe, the proportion of older people (aged 65 years and older) is projected to grow from just under 15% (in 2000) to 23.5% by 2030, while the proportion of those aged 80 years and over is expected to more than double (from 3% in 2000 to 6.4% in 2030) (Kinsella and Phillips 2005). The likelihood of developing a potentially disabling chronic condition rises with increasing age because of the progressive accumulation of exposure to risk factors over a lifetime (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Janssen and Kunst 2005).\nHowever, there is increasing evidence supporting the \u201ccompression of morbi-dity\u201d thesis put forward by Fries (1983), which suggests that as populations adopt healthier lifestyles and therapeutic advances continue, the period of illness (morbidity) that individuals experience prior to death is compressed.\nStudies in several countries demonstrate that people are indeed both living longer and spending less time in poor health (Parker and Thorslund 2007). For Box 2.1 Congestive heart failure Congestive or chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex syndrome that impairs the ability of the heart to function as a pump to support physio-logical circulation (Mosterd and Hoes 2007). Several pathologies fre-quently coexist with CHF, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\nCHF is a major and growing public health issue that affects all Western countries (Cowie et al. 1997; Mosterd and Hoes 2007). However, public awareness of the condition remains low (Remme et al. 2005), and there are few comparative and nationally representative data from across Europe (Mehta and Cowie 2006). A recent review of the epidemiological evidence suggests little indication of a decline in the incidence of heart failure since the 1980s (Mosterd and Hoes 2007) although mortality from CHF appears to have been declining over recent years (Murdoch et al. 1998; Naja\ufb01 et al.\n2006). The true extent is dif\ufb01cult to assess as death from heart failure is substantially underestimated by of\ufb01cial statistics. It has been estimated that possibly at least one-third of deaths attributed to coronary heart dis-ease may also be related to CHF (Murdoch et al. 1998). Because of the ageing of the population, coupled with improved survival because of improved treatment, the projected burden of CHF is set to increase (Stewart et al.\n2003). This poses a considerable challenge to healthcare systems, with one study estimating the costs attributable to caring for people with CHF at 1\u20132% of healthcare resources in industrialized countries, which is likely to increase given the projected rise in the CHF burden (Bundkirchen and Schwinger 2004).\nThe burden of chronic disease in Europe 17 example, a recent systematic review demonstrated how disability and func-tional limitations among older adults in the United States have declined con-sistently during the 1990s (Freedman et al. 2002). Part of this improvement results from therapeutic advances, as older people are increasingly enabled to function with multiple disorders by complex combinations of treatment.\nFreedman et al. (2007) reported that between 1997 and 2004 a rising prevalence of chronic conditions among older Americans (aged 65 and over) was accom-panied by declines in the proportion reporting disability as a result of those conditions, a phenomenon also reported for the Swedish population (Parker and Thorslund 2007). Therefore, while disability might be declining, other health problems might be increasing.\nThis is further supported by a recent report by the OECD that reviewed trends in the prevalence of (severe) disability, de\ufb01ned as one or more limitations in basic activities of daily living, among those aged 65 and over (Lafortune et al.\n2007). It identi\ufb01ed evidence for declining disability prevalence in some coun-tries, such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States and stable rates in Australia and Canada, while for others the evidence was more mixed (France, United Kingdom) or indicated an increase (Belgium, Sweden).\nBased on the expected demographic changes, including population ageing and greater longevity, the analysis projected an increase in the number of older people with severe disability by 2030 even for those countries which recorded a sustained decline over recent years, although the relative increase in projected numbers remained lower than what would be expected if there was no change in current age-speci\ufb01c prevalence rates.\nYet while ageing of populations is an important driver of increases in chronic disease, it is important to emphasize that the perception that chronic illness is an \u201cold people\u2019s\u201d fate no longer applies, with increasing numbers of young and middle-aged people developing some form of chronic health problem. It is esti-mated that in 2002 60% of all DALYs attributable to NCDs were lost before the age of 60 (WHO 2004a). Recent evidence from the United States points to a rapid increase in the number of children and teengagers with chronic health condi-tions since the 1960s (Perrin et al. 2007), in particular as a response to growing levels of obesity. Rising rates of childhood chronic conditions imply subsequent higher rates of related conditions among adults (van der Lee et al. 2007).\nThis brief overview, illustrating how population ageing is an important although not the sole driver of the burden of chronic disease, already points to the varied challenges facing contemporary society. The next section will exam-ine, in detail, speci\ufb01c chronic health problems to highlight further the complex-ity to which health systems will have to respond in order to address the rising burden of chronic disease effectively in Europe and beyond.\nThe burden of selected chronic diseases Cerebrovascular disease Cerebrovascular disease, or stroke, ranks among the leading causes of death worldwide; in 2002, stroke accounted for approximately 15% (men, 11%; 18 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte women, 19%) of all deaths and approximately 7% (6% and 8%, respectively) of the total disease burden in Europe (WHO 2004a). Stroke is a leading neuro-logical cause of long-term disability, with over half of those still alive after six months being left to depend on others for everyday activities (Wolfe 2000) and at least one-quarter remaining moderately or severely disabled three years after stroke (Patel et al. 2006). Stroke has also been associated with depression (Hackett et al. 2005) and been shown to increase the risk of dementia (Liebetrau et al. 2003) and of falls and fractures (Poole et al. 2002), further adding to the overall disease and disability burden.\nMortality from stroke has been falling throughout most of the twentieth cen-tury and particularly so since the 1960s (Bonita 1992; Ebrahim and Harwood 1999). The reasons for this decline are not yet fully understood. Declining inci-dence has been identi\ufb01ed as one contributor, as has improved survival after stroke, attributed to reductions in case-fatality, although the evidence is not consistent (Thorvaldsen et al. 1997; Feigin et al. 2003). Data from the US-based Framingham study indicate a decline in the incidence of stroke over the past 50 years, but there was no decline in severity of stroke and an observed fall in case-fatality was only signi\ufb01cant for men (Carandang et al. 2006). Changes in stroke incidence have been attributed to changing patterns of exposure to, or control of, risk factors for stroke, changing completeness of case ascertainment because of improved awareness and diagnostic practice, and period and cohort effects (Feigin et al. 2003). Elevated blood pressure is a major modi\ufb01able risk factor for stroke and an observed fall in blood pressure levels among young people since the beginning of the twentieth century has been associated with falling stroke incidence (McCarron et al. 2002), as has increased treatment of high blood pressure (Rothwell et al. 2004).\nCurrent projections by the WHO (2006a) suggest that the mortality and dis-ease burden attributable to stroke in their European Region will decrease in both sexes and all ages by 2030. However, others have argued that stroke prevalence and the overall population burden of stroke is likely to increase further since older people are the most stroke-prone age group and constitute the fastest growing segment of the population (Feigin et al. 2003; Terent 2003; Carandang et al. 2006). Moreover, emerging evidence of a recent increase in mean blood pressure in young people in countries such as the United States (Din-Dzietham et al. 2007), along with the rise in childhood obesity in several countries, indi-cate that recent favourable trends in stroke incidence may not be maintained. A recent analysis showed that one in eight deaths from stroke may be attributed to high blood glucose levels (Danai et al. 2006), highlighting how the diabetes \u201cepidemic\u201d, which will be described below, may impact on the future burden of stroke.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates wide variation in the mortality and disease burden attributed to stroke in selected European countries in 2002. The highest burden is concentrated in the countries that have emerged from the Soviet Union, with death and DALY rates in the Russian Federation and the central Asian Republics of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan up to ten times the levels seen in Switzerland, Israel and France. The regional variation in the burden of cerebrovascular dis-ease is further illustrated by utilization data, such as hospital discharge rates, which tend to be higher in north-eastern and central Europe, with, in 2005, very The burden of chronic disease in Europe 19 Figure 2.1 Burden of death and disease attributable to stroke in selected countries in the World Health Organization European Region, 2002.\nSource: From WHO 2004b.\nhigh rates of over 1000 discharges per 100,000 population observed for Hungary, Belarus and Lithuania compared to only between 200 to 230 per 100,000 in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (WHO 2007).\nThis large variation in utilization is likely to re\ufb02ect higher incidence of stroke in some of the countries, as for example reported for Ukraine and the Russian Federation (Feigin et al. 2003). Utilization data such as hospital discharge rates are however dif\ufb01cult to interpret in part because of differences in de\ufb01nitions, for example whether or not long-term beds are included, which for a poten-tially disabling condition such as stroke is likely to re\ufb02ect on reported utilization.\nThe implications for health systems are not insigni\ufb01cant: A recent review of data on stroke prevalence found the age-standardized prevalence for people aged 65 years or more ranging from 4.6% in selected regions of the United States to just over 7% in Italy (L\u2019Aquila) and Newcastle, United Kingdom (Feigin et al.\n2003). The proportion of strokes associated with disability or impairment varied between 55% of all strokes in New Zealand and 77% in Yorkshire, United Kingdom.\nDiabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a major problem worldwide, affecting approximately 180 million people (WHO 2006b). Although not among the leading causes of death recorded in Europe, diabetes has a major impact on the global burden of disease through its detrimental impact, if not controlled, on the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves, so accelerating death and disability from other condi-tions. In 2002, approximately 1.5% of the total disease burden was attributed to diabetes in Europe (men, 1.2%; women, 1.8%) (WHO 2004a). The number of DALYs lost through diabetes tends to increase with age up to 80 years. Rates tend to be higher among men under the age of 60 but higher for women at older ages.\nThe prevalence of diabetes worldwide in 2000 was estimated to be 2.8% and is expected to increase to 4.4% by 2030 (Wild et al. 2004). In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence is already 6.3% (Engelgau et al. 2004), with one in three persons born in 2000 anticipated to develop diabetes at some point in their life (Narayan et al. 2003). This increase is mainly in type 2 diabetes although type 1 diabetes is also increasing swiftly, at approximately 3% per year, espe-cially in central and eastern Europe and among young children (Green and Patterson 2001).\nDiabetes prevalence is projected to increase in Europe within the next two decades (International Diabetes Federation 2003), partly a result of rising obes-ity levels. There is a strong association between obesity, increasingly affecting children, and incidence of type 2 diabetes (Haines et al. 2007). Large relative increases in diabetes prevalence are expected to be seen in countries undergoing economic and nutrition transition such as Belarus, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Turkey, but also in others, for example Switzerland (Inter-national Diabetes Federation 2003).\nIn 2003, estimates for the prevalence of all forms of diabetes mellitus among those aged 20\u201379 years ranged from approximately 3.4% (Ireland) to 10.2% The burden of chronic disease in Europe 21 (Germany) (Figure 2.2) (International Diabetes Federation 2003). There appears to be no clear regional pattern, except perhaps for a clustering of relatively high prevalence rates in central and north-eastern Europe. Data such as those shown in Figure 2.2 have to be interpreted with caution, however, as they are based on surveys that vary in terms of diagnostic criteria (self-report, physician diag-nosed, laboratory diagnosed) and estimates are not standardized for differences in age structure between populations (International Diabetes Federation 2003).\nThe DECODE study of cohorts, established in nine European countries in the 1990s estimated a prevalence of under 10% among those under 60 years of age and 10\u201320% in those aged 60\u201379 years (DECODE Study Group 2003). Import-antly, it con\ufb01rmed that much diabetes is undiagnosed among those under 50 years of age, suggesting that the \u201ctrue\u201d burden of diabetes as measured by disease prevalence in Europe is likely to be higher than estimates shown here.\nThere are important variations in mortality and disease burden attributable to diabetes mellitus within Europe. Age-standardized death rates per 100,000 population ranged from 4.0 (Greece) to 17.9 (Portugal) in 2002, with higher levels reported for Israel (36.1) and Armenia (46.8) (Figure 2.3; WHO 2004b). It has to be emphasized, though, that of\ufb01cially reported deaths from diabetes are likely to underestimate the \u201ctrue\u201d burden in a given population because of underrecording of diabetes as an underlying cause of death, particularly among older people (Jougla et al. 1992). The most common cause of death among people with diabetes is cardiovascular disease, accounting for up to two-thirds of all deaths (Danai et al. 2006).\nDiseases of the respiratory system Respiratory diseases, and particularly COPD and asthma, place a considerable burden on many populations and are among the leading causes of premature death in the European region. Respiratory diseases are responsible for over 4% of total deaths and disease burden in the WHO European region (WHO 2004a).\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD refers to a condition previously described as chronic bronchitis (in\ufb02am-mation and narrowing of the airways) and emphysema (weakening of the struc-ture of the lung) (Loddenkemper et al. 2003). It is increasingly common with age. It is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world (WHO 2006c).\nMortality increases sharply with age in both sexes; rates are higher in men than women.\nCOPD is a common health problem across Europe, but is often underdiag-nosed (Pauwels 2000; Pauwels and Rabe 2004) as many sufferers accept breath-lessness and limited exercise tolerance as features of ageing and regard smoker\u2019s cough as normal. A study conducted in Manchester (United Kingdom) that reported non-reversible air\ufb02ow obstruction in 11% of adults aged over 45 years suggested that of these 65% had not had COPD diagnosed (Devereux 2006).\nIn western Europe, the overall prevalence of COPD (based on spirometry, a measure of lung function, to con\ufb01rm diagnosis) is 4\u201311%, based on data from 22 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte Figure 2.2 Estimated and projected prevalence of diabetes mellitus in 2003 and 2025 in selected countries in Europe.\nSource: From International Diabetes Federation 2003.\nFigure 2.3 Burden of death and disease attributable to diabetes in selected countries in the World Health Organization European Region, 2002.\nSource: From WHO 2004b.\nDenmark (individuals aged 20\u201390 years), England (60\u201375 years), Finland (30 years and older), Italy (25 years and older), Norway (16\u201370 years), Spain (40\u201369 years) and the United Kingdom (16\u201365 years) (Devereux 2006; Halpin and Miravitlles 2006). Data from other regions of Europe are very limited.\nCOPD places a considerable burden on affected individuals, including poor physical functioning and distressing symptoms that require frequent hospital admission. The burden of COPD is estimated to be 393 DALYs per 100,000 popu-lation, with particularly high rates in individuals aged 70 years and over (WHO 2004a). At the age of 60\u201379 years, rates are almost twice as high in men as in women, re\ufb02ecting the leading role of smoking as a causative factor.\nCOPD mortality is increasing worldwide despite advances in its management in recent decades; most patients are not diagnosed until their mid-\ufb01fties (Halpin and Miravitlles 2006). At the European level, the predicted number of deaths attributable to COPD is expected to increase from almost 270,000 in 2005 to over 338,000 deaths by 2030, while the absolute burden of COPD is projected to fall from approximately 3,440,000 to 2,950,000 DALYs (WHO 2006a). However, both death and DALYs are expected to decrease in all age groups and both sexes, with the exception of women aged 70 years and over who will see increases in COPD mortality and DALYs.\nThe contribution of COPD to the overall mortality and burden of disease in European countries varies considerably (Figure 2.4). For example, while it is estimated that in Latvia COPD causes approximately 5.1 deaths and 70 DALYs per 100,000 population, in Kyrgyzstan it associated with 80.9 deaths and 1088 DALYs per 100,000 population.\nAsthma Although asthma has a relatively low fatality rate compared with other chronic diseases, it is estimated that, worldwide, deaths from asthma will increase by almost 20% in the next 10 years if action is not taken to address it (WHO 2006d).\nAt the European level, asthma is responsible for approximately 0.4% of all deaths and 1% of the global burden of disease, equivalent to approximately 43,000 deaths and 1,358,000 DALYs (WHO 2006a). The relative importance of asthma increases with age and is particularly apparent in elderly men and middle-aged women.\nAvailable data suggest that approximately 30 million people in the European region are affected by asthma (Masoli et al. 2004). Prevalence of clinical asthma, (here de\ufb01ned as 50% of the prevalence of wheezing (self-reported) in the previous 12 months in children aged 13\u201314 years), ranges from approximately 1.3 to 18.4% (Figure 2.5). In the United States, asthma prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at around 9%, double the \ufb01gure reported in the 1980s (Moorman et al. 2007). These trends are relevant for projecting the future burden attributable to this condition since asthma persists to adulthood in at least 25% of children (Sears et al. 2003).\nIn adults, asthma prevalence ranges from less than 5% to more than 10% (Loddenkemper et al. 2003). A survey of asthma prevalence in France, Germany, The burden of chronic disease in Europe 25 Figure 2.4 Burden of death and disease attributable to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in selected countries in the World Health Organization European Region, 2002.\nSource: From WHO 2004b.\nItaly, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom suggests that, on average, 15.1% of children and 20.5% of adults with the condition experi-ence severe persistent asthma (Rabe et al. 2000). These individuals are less responsive to standard asthma therapy and have been shown to experience greater morbidity and a lower quality of life than those whose disease can be controlled adequately by therapy (ENFUMOSA-Study-Group 2003).\nProjected trends in the burden of death and disability from asthma differ Figure 2.5 Prevalence of clinical asthma in selected countries in Europe.\nSource: From Masoli et al. 2004.\nThe burden of chronic disease in Europe 27 slightly from those described above for COPD. In terms of mortality, falls in age-standardized death rates are projected in the period 2005\u20132030 in both sexes and at all ages except in men aged 80 years and over (WHO 2006a). The burden of disease attributable to asthma is also expected to fall in men and women aged 30 years and over, but not in younger individuals; increases in DALYs are pro-jected of approximately 1\u20132% in boys and girls aged 0\u20134 years, of 3% in those aged 5\u201314 years and 6\u20137% in those aged 15\u201329 years.\nAge-standardized deaths and DALYs attributable to asthma in European coun-tries appear to vary considerably: age-standardized death rates per 100,000 population range from 0.2 in Greece to 9.1 in the Russian Federation and stand-ardized DALY rates per 100,000 population vary from 66 in Romania to over 330 in the United Kingdom and Ireland (Figure 2.6; WHO 2004b). The Global Burden of Asthma Report 2004 (Masoli et al. 2004) suggested that central Asian republics have some of the highest case-fatality rates (asthma deaths per 100,000 asthmatics) in the European region.\nNeuropsychiatric diseases: unipolar depressive disorders The prevalence of mental disorders is high in the European region (Anderson et al. 2001; Demyttenaere et al. 2004; Kessler et al. 2005; Kessler 2007), with unipolar depressive disorders being the most common (see also Box 2.2). It is estimated that 33.4 million Europeans are affected by major depression each year and that one in \ufb01ve individuals will develop depression during their life-time (WHO 2003).\nThe Global Burden of Disease study estimated the overall incidence and prevalence of unipolar depressive disorders in Europe for the year 2000 (Ustun et al. 2004). Although subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, the esti-mated \ufb01gures provide useful information for the region. The age-standardized incidence of major depressive episodes was estimated to be highest in southeast Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia for both men and women, at 3286 and 5353 per 100,000, respectively. For men, the estimated incidence tended to be somewhat lower in the Baltic countries and northeast Europe, at 2923 per 100,000, and lowest in southern and western Europe, the Nordic countries and parts of central Europe, at 2610 per 100,000. For women, the estimated inci-dence was fairly similar in these regions, though, at 4470 and 4482 per 100,000, respectively, and considerably higher than among men (Ustun et al. 2004).\nMental disorders are increasingly affecting children and adolescents in Europe (WHO 2003). This is particularly alarming as it is now recognized that many mental disorders seen in adulthood have their origins in childhood. It has been estimated that approximately 2 million young people in the European Region are affected by mental disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia.\nApproximately 4% of those aged 12\u201317 years and 9% of those aged 18 years are affected by depressive disorders (WHO 2005c). Depression is associated with suicide in the young, a major problem in many countries and the third leading cause of death among young people. Certain populations, including eastern European men, are at a particular risk of suicide; in western Europe the risk of suicide in adolescents also appears to be increasing (WHO 2005c).\n28 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte Figure 2.6 Burden of death and disease attributable to asthma in selected countries in the World Health Organization European Region, 2002.\nSource: From WHO 2004b.\nIn 2002, unipolar depressive disorders accounted for 6.2% of the regional global burden of disease (1064 DALY per 100,000 population) but only for 0.02% of all deaths (0.21 deaths per 100,000 population) (WHO 2004a).\nCurrent projections suggest that age-standardized death rates for unipolar depressive disorders may decrease slightly in both men and women (from 0.15 to 0.13 per 100,000 population) between 2005 and 2030, yet given the high level of morbidity involved, the burden of disease attributed to this health problem is projected to increase in both sexes (age-standardized rate per 100,000 increasing in men from 777 to 785 and in women from 1312 to 1337) (WHO 2006a).\nFigure 2.7 shows between-country variations in the burden of unipolar depressive disorders in Europe. Age-adjusted DALY rates per 100,000 range from 660 to 1430 DALYs. Rates are lowest in Spain and Greece (less than 700) and highest in Finland, Israel, Slovenia, Belgium and France (greater than 1250) (WHO 2004b).\nBox 2.2 Dementia Dementia is an increasingly prevalent mental disorder in Europe. A gen-eric term, dementia refers to chronic or progressive dysfunction of cortical and subcortical function that results in complex cognitive decline. Alzhe-imer\u2019s diseases is the most common form of dementia in Europe and North America (Ritchie and Lovestone 2002). Dementia is one of the most important causes of disability in older people and is set to rise with the increasing proportion of older people. Current estimates suggest that there are 7.4 million people living with dementia in Europe, accounting for approximately 30% of the total worldwide (Wimo et al. 2003). In developed countries, dementia prevalence is estimated at 1.5% at 65 years, doubling every four years to approximately 30% among those aged 80 years (Ritchie and Lovestone 2002). Within Europe in 2000, prevalence among those 65 years or older is estimated to vary between 6% in eastern Europe and 8% in northern Europe (Wimo et al. 2003). More recent esti-mates derived from a Delphi exercise involving international experts have placed the prevalence of dementia in Europe among those 60 years or older at 3.8% in eastern Europe and 5.4% in western Europe, somewhat higher than that estimated for the developed western Paci\ufb01c, at 4.2%, but lower than in North America, at 6.4% (Ferri et al. 2005). Consistent with other analyses, Ferri et al. (2005) projected an increase in the number of people (age 60+ years) with dementia in Europe from 7.7 million in 2001 to 10.8 million in 2020 (31\u201351% increase in different regions in Europe).\nThe aetiology of dementia is not yet well understood. Con\ufb01rmed risk fac-tors include increasing age, the occurrence of dementia in a family mem-ber and genetic predisposition (Ritchie and Lovestone 2002). More recently, increased body mass index has been associated with an increased risk of dementia (Gorospe and Dave 2006), which, if con\ufb01rmed, may have considerable implications for the future given rising obesity levels.\n30 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte Figure 2.7 Burden of disease attributable to unipolar depressive disorder in selected countries in the World Health Organization European Region, 2002.\nSource: From WHO 2004b.\nPrevalence estimates vary because of variations in case de\ufb01nition, assessment tools and the populations covered. A pooled analysis of community studies in \ufb01ve European countries gave an overall estimate of the prevalence of depressive disorders among adults aged 18\u201365 years at 8.6%, ranging from 6.6% in men and 10.1% in women (Ayuso-Mateos et al. 2001). Estimates of 12-month preva-lence of depression among the working population in 13 European countries ranged from 3.2% in Italy to 10.1% in Norway, with a \u201cEuropean\u201d median of 6.9% (Sobocki et al. 2006). Prevalence rates were reported to be consistently higher among women and to slightly vary with age, with the estimated European medians being 5.8% for men and 8.3% for women in those aged 18\u201334 years and 5.2% for men and 8.5% for women in those aged 35\u201349 years. Prevalence tended to fall for those aged 50\u201364, to 3.4% in men and 6.6% in women.\nComorbidity and multimorbidity Previous sections have set out the present and projected future burden of disease attributable to a range of leading chronic conditions. However, as noted above, it is important to recognize that these conditions often do not occur in iso-lation. Indeed, increased longevity, coupled with advances in healthcare, has meant that there are growing numbers of people with multiple disease pro-cesses, creating a range of diverse and sometimes contradictory needs that pose considerable challenges to those affected and to the delivery of health services (Piette et al. 2004). For example, depression and arthritis in people with diabetes impair functioning and cause substantial barriers to implementing lifestyle changes and adhering to therapeutic regimens (Piette and Kerr 2006).\nMultimorbidity has been de\ufb01ned as the simultaneous occurrence of several medical conditions in the same person (Fortin et al. 2005). The term multimor-bidity is often used interchangeably with comorbidity, although the latter refers more speci\ufb01cally to conditions that occur as a consequence of one leading (\u201cindex\u201d) condition such as diabetes (Feinstein 1970) (although others have offered different taxonomies, see for example Piette and Kerr (2006) and van Weel and Schellevis (2006)). However, in either case, the available epidemi-ological evidence is fairly restricted, posing challenges to those seeking a comprehensive assessment of the extent of this problem.\nA recent overview of the available evidence reports a wide range of estimates of the prevalence of multimorbidity in four industrialized countries in the 1990s, although these are dif\ufb01cult to compare because of differences in data sources, for example population surveys or administrative databases, and age ranges covered (Fortin et al. 2005). Keeping these limitations in mind, among those aged 65 years and over the reported prevalence of the presence of two or more chronic health problems was at least 50%, increasing markedly with age. That study also undertook a separate analysis of data obtained from family practices in Quebec, Canada, estimating that two or more chronic health problems were present in 69% of those aged 18\u201344 years, 93% of those aged 45\u201364 years and 99% of those aged 65 and over. It found that almost 50% of patients between the ages of 45 and 64 years had \ufb01ve or more chronic condi-tions (Fortin et al. 2005). These seemingly high \ufb01gures are likely to be explained, 32 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte at least in part, by the design of the study, with data collected in a primary care setting.\nIn contrast, data from a population-based study of eight countries undertaken during the 1990s found prevalence rates of those with one chronic condition, based on self-reported data of the adult population aged 18 years and over, to range from 14% in the Netherlands to 28\u201329% in France and Norway (pooled estimate of eight countries, 25%; Alonso et al. 2004). Those reporting two chronic conditions ranged from 7% in the Netherlands to 18% in Italy and the United States (pooled estimate, 13%). These \ufb01gures are much lower than those reported by Fortin et al. (2005). The former study relied on self-reported data, and also considered a limited range of health problems as \u201cchronic condition\u201d only (Alonso et al. 2004). However, the Canadian study considered a much broader range of conditions; furthermore, data were collected from patients seeking care, thus possibly overestimating the prevalence of multimorbidity in the general population.\nAdditional evidence on the extent of multimorbidity comes from the indi-vidual country case studies in the volume that accompanies this book, although methodological constraints (as noted above) make it dif\ufb01cult to compare these data. Those reported are not dissimilar to those reported by Alonso et al. (2004) and Fortin et al. (2005). For example, in the Netherlands, 61% of men aged 60\u201379 years reported at least two chronic conditions (average 2.4); this increased to 74% among men who were 80 years or older (average 3.2) (van den Jeths et al. 2004). In Germany, some 62% people aged 55\u201369 years reported at least two chronic conditions, and this proportion increased to approximately 80% among those aged 70\u201385 years (Figure 2.8).\nInterpreting the evidence This chapter has relied to a great extent on mortality statistics to evaluate pat-terns of health in European populations. The advantage is that mortality data Figure 2.8 Frequency of multiple conditions in Germany, 2002.\nSource: From Deutsche Zentrum f\u00fcr Altersfragen 2005.\nThe burden of chronic disease in Europe 33 are routinely available in most countries and that death is a unique event that is clearly de\ufb01ned (Ruzicka and Lopez 1990). There are, however, important caveats regarding statistics of causes of death, concerning validity and com-pleteness of both death and population denominator data. While mortality data in the European region are generally considered as of good quality, there are some countries in transition that have been experiencing problems in ensuring complete registration of all deaths, mainly those of the least-developed parts of central Asia (McKee and Chenet 2002) and regions that have been af\ufb02icted by war, as in the Caucasus (Badurashvili et al. 2001) and southeast Europe (Bozicevic et al. 2001). Despite some improvements since the 1990s, problems remain, with recent \ufb01gures estimating completeness of mor-tality data from vital registration systems to range between 60% in Albania and 66\u201375% in the Caucasus to 84\u201389% in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (Mathers et al. 2005). These estimates relate to adult deaths only, and completeness of child death registration is likely to be lower in many parts of the region. In addition, in several countries, the vital registration system does not cover the total resident population but excludes certain geographical areas, such as Chechnya in the Russian Federation or the Transdnistria region in Moldova (WHO 2007).\nImportantly, however, as indicated above, mortality data capture only those causes of morbidity that have a fatal outcome and they are, therefore, only an approximate measure of the burden of disease in a given population. This is because mortality data available for statistical analysis routinely report a single underlying cause of death only (Kelson and Farebrother 1987; Mackenbach et al. 1987). This creates problems when certifying deaths at old age, as multiple conditions coexist and attribution of death to just one of them may be almost impossible. Although methodologically more complex, applying multiple cause of death codings, which considers all (contributing) causes of death, could help to provide more comprehensive insights and facilitate studies of the relation-ships among conditions (Jougla et al. 2001). Consequently, estimating the \u201ctrue\u201d burden of mortality from chronic illness in the European region will remain a challenge if it is based on existing routine statistics in their current format.\nIn contrast to mortality, routine collection of markers of morbidity such as incidence and prevalence rates remains relatively scarce, with the possible exception of infectious diseases, which are generally captured in national moni-toring and control systems, albeit to varying degrees (MacLehose et al. 2002).\nAvailable information on morbidity attributable to chronic diseases is often limited to local studies, such as the WHO MONICA Project, or registries for speci\ufb01c diseases, such as cancer registries. These can provide useful additional information but can sometimes be misleading, for example where registration is not population based. Population surveys, by comparison, are often not comparable across regions, and even when they are, will usually re\ufb02ect only the \u201cgeneral\u201d population while excluding speci\ufb01c subpopulations such as the institutionalized or those who are dif\ufb01cult to reach.\nEstimates of prevalence or incidence are also in\ufb02uenced by the criteria used to identify health problems. For example, the DECODE Study examined the effect of different diagnostic practices on prevalence estimates for diabetes and 34 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte impaired glucose regulation in 13 populations from nine European countries (DECODE Study Group 2003). It found that using fasting glucose as the sole diagnostic criterion potentially underestimated the prevalence of both prob-lems in several populations, particularly in women and in older men. Similarly, there is as yet no consensus on the precise de\ufb01nition of COPD, as is also the case for multimorbidity. Consequently, while it is generally agreed that COPD should be diagnosed using spirometry, the criteria used to de\ufb01ne air\ufb02ow obstruction vary and may produce prevalence estimates that differ by 200% (Celli et al. 2003). Also, similarities in the presentation of asthma and COPD, and the fact that these conditions coexist in many patients, create diagnostic uncertainty.\nAssessing the \u201ctrue\u201d disease burden is particularly problematic for conditions that are not easily identi\ufb01ed, as in the case of dementia. Many people in the early stages of dementia are undiagnosed; for example in the United Kingdom, it is estimated that only about a third to a half of sufferers ever receive a formal diagnosis (National Audit Of\ufb01ce 2007). Fear and ignorance of the disease among people affected as well as attitudes of health professionals, namely a perception that little can be done, along with a lack of urgency in investigation and inter-vention, have been identi\ufb01ed as key barriers to early diagnosis.\nAs for multimorbidity, there is lack of agreement on how to measure it and, more importantly perhaps, most assessments are based on a simple count of the number of conditions without taking account of their severity (Fortin et al.\n2005). This type of information is, however, crucial for assessing the \u201ctrue\u201d burden of illness if it is to inform healthcare planning.\nThe way forward This chapter has illustrated the many challenges associated with assessing, comparing and contrasting the level, distribution, and nature of the chronic disease burden in Europe. Clearly it will be essential to continue efforts to tackle the technical and methodological problems and to ensure the develop-ment and collection of robust, consistent indicators required to inform policies to respond to burden of chronic diseases in Europe and elsewhere. Initiatives such as the European Health Survey System, currently being developed by Eurostat and the European Commission\u2019s Health and Protection Directorate-General, is a potential way forward, with the recent Special Eurobarometer report Health in the European Union as one important step in this direction (European Commission 2004, 2007), albeit with small samples of uncertain rep-resentative power in each country. Governments and international agencies are calling for greater accountability and transparency, as are civil society, the donor community, scientists and the public, in order to measure progress and performance of health systems. This calls for information that goes beyond simple descriptive statistics to including aspects of health system performance such as quality, ef\ufb01ciency, equity and quanti\ufb01cation of uncertainty.\nPrimary collection of data on chronic diseases is of critical importance to elucidate the disease burden in a given population and thus devise appropriate strategies for prevention and management. Inadequate quality and poor The burden of chronic disease in Europe 35 availability of health statistics may result from poor measurement instruments, insuf\ufb01cient or suboptimal data collection methods and lack of analysis and methods to produce comparable estimates (Boerma and Stans\ufb01eld 2007).\nSeveral chronic conditions and their risk factors lack an appropriate \u201ctest\u201d that can be used in surveys to estimate population prevalence (Boerma and Stans-\ufb01eld 2007). In discussing the development of the ISARE project to generate a database of various health, demographic and socioeconomic indicators at subnational level in Europe, Wilkinson et al. (2008) have highlighted the dif-\ufb01culties encountered in supplying data even when there is willingness to do so.\nMurray (2007) identi\ufb01ed several issues to be addressed to achieve good prac-tice in the use of health statistics. There is a need to channel efforts to improving the measurement of a small set of priority indicators in order to enhance poli-tical visibility while using limited resources most effectively. The de\ufb01nition of priority indicators should meet certain criteria so as to enhance their usefulness to inform policy. These include being clear on what the proposed indicator is intended to measure, the public health signi\ufb01cance of the indicator, how well the indicator measures the quantity of interest, how readily interpretable the indicator value is, whether there is a practical measurement strategy and how well the indicator captures equity (Murray 2007).\nMurray (2007) has also argued for explicit data audit trails to address existing controversies about health statistics, to increase transparency and to encourage better primary data collection and analytical methods. Audit trials should be available to the public and make explicit the process for primary data collection, post-data collection adjustments, choice of models, including covariates used for predictions, and all other documentation necessary to understand data presented to the public.\nHowever, while enhancing data collection systems and methodological approaches to overcome inevitable data limitations is certainly an important step forward in assessing the \u201ctrue\u201d burden of disease in a given population, it is important to emphasize the need to go beyond simply creating health informa-tion systems. What is needed is a willingness among policy makers to invest in \u201cintelligence\u201d, a system in which knowledge generation, synthesis and imple-mentation are crucially integrated in the healthcare system in order to enable systematic and comprehensive assessment of population health needs and to inform strategic responses to the rising burden of chronic illness in Europe and elsewhere.\nConclusions This chapter has described the major contribution that chronic diseases make to the overall burden of disease and death in the WHO European Region. With cardiovascular diseases and cancers continuing to be the leading causes of mor-tality in the region, and complex conditions such as diabetes and depression projected to impose a growing and costly burden, the need for reliable, appropriate and comparable data to inform local and national policies and initiatives is all the more pressing. With changing demographic patterns and increasing evidence of the health and societal costs of chronic diseases, it will be 36 J. Pomerleau, C. Knai and E. Nolte all the more crucial to address the methodological challenges in assessing and monitoring the chronic disease burden.\nNotes 1.\nEstimates of the disease burden are based on a range of assumptions and their limita-tions have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Lopez et al. 2006; Mathers and Loncar 2006). A key issue is how to de\ufb01ne and measure disability and then to select the weights to apply to particular health states. The effect of disability weighting is that conditions which, while disabling, rarely cause death (in particular mental illness) are ranked as more important than they would be using mortality alone. A related issue is the value placed on a year of life at different stages in life, with the Global Burden of Disease study placing more weight on a year of life of a young adult than on that of a child or older person. This has the effect of reducing the burden of disease arising from deaths in childhood.\n2.\nWe here use the de\ufb01nition put forward by the United States National Library of Medi-cine\u2019s controlled vocabulary used for indexing articles, which de\ufb01nes chronic diseases as those \u201cwhich have one or more of the following characteristics: they are perma-nent, leave residual disability, are caused by non-reversible pathological alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be expected to require a long period of supervision, observation, or care\u201d (Timmreck 1986). This de\ufb01nition includes a range of health problems such as diabetes, cerebrovascular and heart dis-ease, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, progressive multiple scler-osis, chronic heart and renal failure as well as HIV/AIDS. Cancer has traditionally been excluded from this de\ufb01nition because of the generally non-chronic nature of the disease; however, this is changing with the expansion of effective treatment, and the WHO (2005a) now explicitly considers cancer as a chronic disease.\nReferences Alonso, J., Ferrer, M., Gandeck, B. et al.

Knai and E. Nolte chapter three Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management Marc Suhrcke, Daragh K. Fahey and Martin McKee Introduction Health policy makers face many competing calls on their attention. Inevitably, their focus is often dominated by the urgent and the measurable, hence the priorities given to, for example, outbreaks of communicable disease or the reduction in waiting lists. In contrast, despite the enormous contribution that it makes to the overall burden of disease, the phenomenon of chronic diseases tends to be seen as being neither urgent nor easily measurable. Indeed, until the seminal work of the Global Burden of Disease study, which added morbidity to the traditional measurement of mortality, the scale of the problem posed by chronic diseases was, to many policy makers, largely invisible. The problem was compounded by the absence of easy solutions. During the twentieth century, huge health gains were achieved with technically relatively simple solutions, such as mass vaccination or the integrated management of childhood illness. In contrast, as illustrated in Chapters 4 and 10, effective management of chronic diseases demands the creation of complex systems that bridge the different dis-ciplinary perspectives and confront entrenched cognitive and \ufb01nancial barriers to cooperation, plus the support of appropriate information technology. Worse, from the perspective of the politician whose time horizon is dominated by the electoral cycle, the results of innovation are likely to be seen long in the future, when someone else will be able to take the credit.\nThis chapter recognizes the strong disincentives to initiate effective action but seeks to counterbalance them by highlighting the economic arguments for doing so. It presents evidence showing that the economic cost of chronic disease in Europe is high and that there may well be a strong economic argument for a society to invest in chronic disease management.\nThe starting point for the \ufb01rst part of the chapter, on the assessment of the cost of chronic disease, is a recent publication by the European Commission (Suhrcke et al. 2005) that has assembled much of the existing body of research on this topic. Before looking at this evidence, however, it is necessary to consider what is meant by \u201ceconomic costs\u201d and, in particular, how they are relevant to the discussion of chronic disease.\nThe second part examines the economics of chronic disease management. We begin by discussing brie\ufb02y the reasons for undertaking such economic evalu-ations, providing a framework that describes the different categories of costs and bene\ufb01ts that are relevant and complementing the conceptual discussion with selected empirical examples. Inevitably, the examples chosen draw heavily on the much greater volume of research on this topic from the United States, compared with Europe. Nevertheless, where possible, we review what has been done or is planned to be done in terms of evaluations \u2013 economic and non-economic \u2013 in Europe, given the quite different health systems contexts.\nThe economic burden of chronic diseases in Europe This section reviews different concepts of economic costs, highlighting their variety and the potential confusion between them and illustrating them with selected empirical examples. A more complete account of the empirical evi-dence on the costs of chronic disease can be found in Adeyi et al. (2007) and Suhrcke et al. (2006); Suhrcke et al. (2007) have focused on evidence from east-ern Europe and central Asia. We distinguish \ufb01ve cost concepts, each with dis-tinctive implications for measurement: costs of illness, microeconomic costs/ consequences, macroeconomic costs/consequences, \u201cwelfare\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d eco-nomic costs and public policy-relevant versus policy-irrelevant costs.\nCost of illness Cost-of-illness studies estimate both the quantity of resources (in monetary terms) used to treat a disease and the negative economic consequences of ill-ness, measured as lost productivity to society or to a speci\ufb01c sector. They repre-sent a useful \ufb01rst step in assessing the economic burden of ill health in general and of chronic disease in particular, with most studies suggesting that the bur-den is substantial. Cost-of-illness studies can also provide the foundation for subsequent economic evaluations of speci\ufb01c interventions or policy measures to reduce the burden of disease. Cost-of-illness studies separate costs into three components.\nDirect costs. These are the costs of medical care in relation to prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. They include costs such as ambulances, inpatient or outpatient care, rehabilitation, community health services and 44 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee medication. Of the cost components, this is the least controversial measure-ment, although it is also not without problems.\nIndirect costs. The loss of human resources caused by morbidity or premature death re\ufb02ect indirect costs. The measurement of indirect costs is a matter of much debate. Some cost-of-illness studies consider the loss of future earnings (the human-capital approach) and thereby restrict the estimate to the working population. Others use the willingness-to-pay method, which assesses what people are willing to pay for relatively small changes in the risk of death. These \ufb01gures, which are not restricted to the working population, make it possible to derive the value that people assign to life.\nIntangible costs. These capture the psychological dimensions of illness includ-ing pain, bereavement, anxiety and suffering. This cost category is typically hardest to measure.\nTable 3.1 provides examples of these components.\nTable 3.1 Examples of direct, indirect and intangible costs Type of cost Example Direct costs Healthcare Ambulance Clinician assessment and management (e.g. physicians, nurses) Ongoing care (e.g. nurse assistants, carers) Procedures (e.g. surgery) Investigations (e.g. blood tests) Medicines Equipment (e.g. dialysis, wheelchairs) Educational (e.g. lea\ufb02ets, websites) Lifestyle (e.g. exercise on prescription, dietetics) Rehabilitation Physical (e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy) Mental (e.g. counselling) Social (e.g. employment training, support for independence and activities of daily living) Social care Home assessments and upgrades Meals on wheels Housing (e.g. sheltered housing) Indirect costs Wider economy Reduced productivity of patient and carer Unemployment bene\ufb01ts Individual Reduced income Loss of future earnings from selling assets Carers leaving education early to care for sick relative Intangible costs Pain Bereavement Anxiety Stigma Frustration Depression Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 45 In practice, most studies assess direct and indirect costs only.1 A selective literature review undertaken for an earlier study showed that the cost of chronic diseases and their risk factors, as measured by cost-of-illness studies, is sizeable, ranging from 0.02% to 6.77% of a country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) (Suhrcke et al. 2006). For cardiovascular disease, the total cost varies between 1 and 3% in most developed countries for which results are available, although when interpreting the \ufb01gures it is important to note that the numerical results from cost-of-illness studies are typically not directly comparable across coun-tries, disease categories and time. Table 3.2 presents estimates of direct costs of cardiovascular disease for 25 countries of the European Union. Table 3.3 shows cost-of-illness estimates for a limited set of other conditions and risk factors.\nCost-of-illness studies are limited by certain conceptual and methodological constraints. Some have argued that the cost-of-illness approach represents a public health view of \u201ccosts\u201d, rather than an economic view (Sindelar 1998).\nFrom a public health perspective, society should be as healthy as possible, which would reduce expensive medical treatments. From this perspective, Table 3.2 Healthcare costs for cardiovascular disease by EU country, 2003 Country Cost per capita (\u0001) Percentage of total healthcare expenditure Germany 423 15 United Kingdom 368 18 Sweden 318 12 Netherlands 273 11 Luxembourg 255 8 Austria 247 11 Finland 235 12 Denmark 215 7 Italy 204 11 Belgium 201 8 France 194 8 Greece 140 11 Ireland 108 4 Spain 97 7 Portugal 93 8 Czech Republic 83 14 Slovenia 80 8 Cyprus 67 7 Estonia 55 17 Hungary 52 9 Slovakia 52 18 Poland 46 16 Lithuania 43 16 Latvia 24 11 Malta 22 2 TOTAL EU 230 12 Source: Petersen et al. (2005).\n46 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee cost-of-illness studies should assign a monetary value to all the morbidity and mortality that is associated with a disease or a risk factor and measure the med-ical expenditures that would be saved if there had been no illness. In contrast, an economic perspective does not start from the assumption that society should be as healthy as possible. Economists assess the cost of a given situation by comparing it with its next best (and feasible) alternative situation (the \u201ccounter-factual\u201d). Implicitly, cost-of-illness studies assume that the counterfactual is the absence of chronic disease, mortality or the risk factor that gives rise to disease. This is often too ambitious a counterfactual, either because it cannot be achieved even with the most intensive possible interventions or it may be undesirable from a welfare perspective because the resources required could be used more effectively in other ways.\nA signi\ufb01cant further limitation of cost-of-illness studies, irrespective of whether they take a public health or economic perspective, is that the method-ologies commonly applied do not address causality. While they include costs that are seemingly associated with chronic disease and risk factors they do not establish that chronic disease or risk factors actually cause the costs to occur.2 This is of particular relevance in relation to unhealthy behaviours, where the assignment of costs to a speci\ufb01c disease is problematic. From a policy perspec-tive it is, however, critical to understand the \u201ctrue\u201d causes in order to be able to target interventions most effectively.3 Microeconomic costs/consequences Microeconomic studies assess the effect of health on economic outcomes while taking into account other relevant factors. Microeconomic analysis can evaluate the mechanisms by which health in\ufb02uences economic outcomes and can assess the relative contributions of these mechanisms. Ideally, such studies also attempt to address the two most salient econometric challenges involved: Table 3.3 Selected cost-of-illness studies in which cost is expressed as percentage of national health expenditure Condition/risk factor Country Percentage of national health expenditure Year Coronary heart disease United Kingdom 11 1999 Schizoprenia France 2 1992 United Kingdom 1.7 1992\u201303 Netherlands 1.6 1989 Depression United Kingdom 0.9 1990\u201301 Mental illness United States 7 1990 Obesity France 2 1992 Portugal 3.5 1996 Diabetes Various 2.5\u201315 Various Tobacco Germany 5.6 1993 Source: Suhrcke et al. (2005), where full details of studies are given.\nEconomic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 47 measurement error in the (often self-reported) health proxy that is used and the potential reverse causality (with a better economic situation contributing to better health).\nThe importance of at least trying to assess the direction of causality should not be underestimated. This is of immediate relevance to policy makers as it helps to specify entry points for policy interventions. For individuals, micro-economic evidence of this kind may illustrate the price they are paying in addition to the disease burden they are suffering.\nThe key routes through which ill health may impact on \ufb01nal economic out-put are through its effects on education, saving and investment, labour product-ivity and labour supply (Suhrcke et al. 2005). Much of the empirical evidence is on labour productivity and supply, not necessarily because they are more important but because these two factors are generally easier to measure. Why, and how far, does ill health in general and chronic disease in particular affect these two key economic factors?\nLabour productivity. Healthier individuals could reasonably be expected to produce more per hour worked. Thus, productivity could increase directly as a result of enhanced physical and mental activity. At the same time, individuals who are more physically and mentally active could make better and more ef\ufb01-cient use of technology, machinery or equipment. A healthier labour force could also be expected to be more \ufb02exible and adaptable to changes (e.g.\nchanges in task pro\ufb01les or the organization of labour).\nLabour supply. The impact of health on labour supply is theoretically ambigu-ous. Good health reduces the number of days an individual spends sick, which consequently results in an increase in the number of healthy days available for either work or leisure. But health also in\ufb02uences the decision to supply labour through its impact on wages, preferences and expected life horizon. The effect of health on labour supply through each of these intermediate mechanisms is not always obvious. On the one hand, if wages are linked to productivity, and healthier workers are more productive, health improvements will be expected to increase wages and thus the incentives to increase labour supply (substitution effect). On the other hand, being healthy might allow higher lifetime earnings and, therefore, allow people to retire early (income effect).\nThere is considerable evidence to suggest that both mechanisms operate, especially with chronic diseases (and their related risk factors).\nLabour productivity In the absence of measures of physical output, economists use wages and (partly) earnings as indicators of labour productivity. Several studies demon-strate that poor health is associated with decreases in wages and earnings (Chirikos and Nestel 1985; Currie and Madrian 1999; Hansen 2000; Contoyan-nis and Rise 2001; Pelkowski and Berger 2004). Although the magnitude of the effect differs among studies using different proxy measures for health, the results do not differ qualitatively. Other studies use measures such as height and body mass index as proxies for health and \ufb01nd that, in general, greater height, which tends to re\ufb02ect health in childhood, has a positive impact on wages and earnings while a higher body mass index depresses them, although more so for 48 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee women than for men (Averett and Korenman 1996; Cawley 2000; Mitra 2001; Finkelstein et al. 2005; Brunello and d\u2019Hombres 2007). It is, however, plausible that these associations could, in part, be accounted for by the social meaning attributed to height, and by social stigma in the case of obesity, rather than by a direct effect of health on productivity (Averett and Korenman 1996).\nLabour supply There is also considerable research showing that better health increases labour supply in developed countries, as measured by employment, hours worked, and the probability of retiring from the labour force. It is, however, important to recognize that \ufb01ndings will be sensitive to institutional frameworks, such as pension regulations, availability of disability bene\ufb01ts and occupational insur-ance arrangements, which can protect against or exacerbate the economic impact of poor health. Ill health matters, not only for those in employment but also for their household members, who adapt their employment in response to illness among their household members (Ettner 1996; Spiess and Schneider 2004). For the European Union and the United States, it was found that men reduce their work levels and are more likely to exit the labour force when their wives become ill, while women are more likely to work when their husbands fall ill, presumably to compensate for lost household income (Berger 1983; Charles 1999; Jim\u00e9nez-Mart\u00edn et al. 1999). However there is a need for caution when applying research in the United States to Europe, as labour participation deci-sions are sensitive to the availability of health insurance and disability bene\ufb01ts (Coile 2003).\nMacroeconomic costs/consequences A further cost dimension, of particular interest to policy makers, relates to the aggregate economy and seeks to capture the extent to which ill health (or here speci\ufb01cally chronic diseases) can make a difference (if any) to the level or the growth rate of national per capita income. Health in general \u2013 measured as life expectancy or adult mortality \u2013 has generally been found to be a robust and strong predictor of economic growth (Barro 1991, 1996; Levine and Renelt 1992; Barro and Lee 1994; Barro and Martin 1995; Sachs and Warner 1995, 1997; Easterly and Levine 1997; Bhargava et al. 2001; Sala-i-Martin et al. 2004; Acemoglu and Johnson 2006). Since chronic disease constitutes a major part of the overall health burden and accounts for a major part of adult mortality, it might be expected to have a negative impact on economic growth. Quantifying this impact is, however, fraught with methodological challenges.4 The relation-ship between health and the economy also differs between rich and poor coun-tries: once a certain level of economic development is reached, there is no longer a clear association between per capita incomes and life expectancy.\nBarro (1996), using a worldwide sample of rich and poor countries, estimated that a \ufb01ve-year increase in life expectancy was associated with a 0.3\u20130.5% higher annual GDP growth rate in subsequent years. This \ufb01nding could, in principle, be used indirectly to infer a relationship between chronic disease mortality Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 49 and growth. Other studies, again using a worldwide sample of countries, have assessed the impact of speci\ufb01c diseases, including malaria (Gallup and Sachs 2001), HIV/AIDS (Dixon et al. 2001), malnutrition (Weil 2005) and tuberculosis (Del\ufb01no and Simmons 1999), on growth, controlling for a set of other standard determinants of growth.\nThese studies do not, of course, look at chronic diseases. Suhrcke and Urban (2006) looked at the impact of cardiovascular deaths among the working-age population on economic growth. Using a worldwide sample of countries for which data were available, they found that the result was dependent on the initial economic situation of the country. Dividing the sample into (broadly) low/middle-income countries and high-income countries they found a 1% increase in the mortality rate decreased the growth rate of per capita income in the subsequent \ufb01ve years by approximately 0.1% in high-income settings. The \ufb01nding was based on panel data at \ufb01ve-year-intervals between 1960 and 2000 and took account of other factors including initial income, openness and secondary schooling. The authors used a dynamic panel growth regression framework, taking into account potential problems from reverse causality or omitted variables that might in\ufb02uence both cardiovascular mortality and growth simultaneously. While 0.1% may appear small in terms of growth, the absolute level is quite substantial when summed over the long term. In contrast, there was no signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence of cardiovascular mortality on growth in the sample from low/middle-income countries.\nThe \ufb01ndings of that analysis must, however, be interpreted with great cau-tion, in particular as they relate to countries of low and middle incomes, where most cause-speci\ufb01c adult mortality data are very limited in terms of quality and completeness. At the same time, the \ufb01ndings for this group of countries appear plausible because cardiovascular disease only began to emerge as a substantial contributor to mortality towards the later part of the period observed (1960\u20132000). The increase is arguably in response to economic progress, rather than it being a determinant thereof. If the results for high-income countries can be taken as a guide, cardiovascular disease is likely to assume a greater role as a determinant of economic growth as the chronic disease burden in developing countries progresses further.\n\u201cWelfare\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d economic costs Valuing the macroeconomic losses incurred as a result of chronic disease by means of a broader measure than per-person GDP would explicitly recognize that the \u201ctrue\u201d purpose of economic activity is to maximize social welfare and not just GDP. This concept begins with the uncontroversial premise that GDP is an imperfect measure of social welfare: speci\ufb01cally it fails to incorporate the value of health. One different approach is the willingness-to-pay method, which makes it possible to attribute an approximate monetary value to changes in mortality. Extending this approach to chronic diseases is a fairly straight-forward and instructive exercise, the results of which are likely to demonstrate more clearly the importance of chronic disease.\nA great deal, if not all, of the reservations about putting a monetary value on 50 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee life and health stems from a misunderstanding of what such a value actually means, and some of that misperception may re\ufb02ect unfortunate use of termi-nology. In fact, we cannot \u2013 and do not seek to \u2013 place a monetary value on our own or on other individuals\u2019 lives. Instead, we are valuing what are often com-paratively small changes in the risk of mortality, which is a very different matter.\nWhile, under normal circumstances, no one would trade his or her life for a sum of money, most people will be prepared to choose between equipment at differ-ent prices that offer different levels of safety, between different ways of crossing a street but taking different lengths of time, or between jobs that involve diffe-rent mortality risks but different wages. The fact that these choices are made indicates that people do implicitly put a price on their risk of mortality.\nWhile the value of an increase or decrease in the risk of mortality is not directly observable, it can be inferred from the actual choices people make when facing trade-offs between mortality risk and \ufb01nancial compensation. The most common procedure is to use labour market data about the wage premium that workers demand if they are to do a more dangerous job. Once the risk premium is estimated, the implied value of a statistical life can readily be calculated and then used to value the \u201ccosts\u201d of mortality (and, with modi\ufb01cations, of ill health).\nBy way of caution, it is important to bear in mind that, while the underlying concept is theoretically sound and generally accepted among economists, serious problems need to be overcome when applying it empirically. Estimates of the value of a statistical life vary by a large factor, even within a given coun-try. This is attributable, for example, to the use of different methodologies to calculate the risk premium or to using data on different populations. A simpli-\ufb01ed application of the welfare cost approach to the valuation of the costs of chronic disease is provided elsewhere (WHO 2005).\nPublic policy: relevant versus irrelevant costs From an economic perspective, not all of the costs described above are rele-vant for public policy. Costs are considered relevant if they justify public policy intervention on the grounds of ef\ufb01ciency. In the idealized world that \ufb01ts the following assumptions, there are no costs that justify public policy interventions: \u2022 all costs and bene\ufb01ts are \u201cinternal\u201d (or \u201cprivate\u201d): all the costs and bene\ufb01ts associated with a given choice are taken into account and borne by the person making that choice \u2022 rationality: individuals maximize some objective function (e.g. their utility function) under the constraints they face, weighing the cost they would expect to incur with the expected bene\ufb01ts of the choice in question, the ultimate decision maximizing net bene\ufb01ts (or utility) \u2022 perfect information: individuals have complete information about the expected consequences of their actions \u2022 preferences are \u201ctime-consistent\u201d: put simply, individuals face no serious problems of self-control.\nEconomic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 51 In reality, however, one or more of these assumptions almost always does not hold true, with the result that the market, left alone, does not achieve the out-come most desirable for society. In this case, at least some of the costs of chronic disease do justify public policy intervention. This is because the costs are either not borne by the individual directly concerned (\u201cexternal costs\u201d) or they are incurred by an individual person making a particular choice (i.e. private) as a consequence of non-rational behaviour, imperfect information or because of intra-personal con\ufb02icts. The higher the share of the internal or external costs relevant to public policy, the greater is the justi\ufb01cation for government to intervene to improve net social welfare (if it can).\nSuhrcke et al. (2006) discuss extensively the potential market failures that arise in relation to chronic disease risk factors. In brief, their main conclusions are as follows.\n\u2022 The presence of health or social costs of an individual\u2019s unhealthy behaviours that are borne by society at large (\u201cexternalities\u201d) or by family members (\u201cquasi-externalities\u201d) may justify intervention, although the former, in par-ticular, are typically not considered to be large in comparison with internal costs.\n\u2022 There is widespread recognition that some members of the population, in particular children, are not (yet) the rational actors that economic theory assumes. Therefore, interventions that protect children are more likely to be supported.\n\u2022 Information is a public good and as such it will generally be undersupplied compared with what is socially optimal. Hence, there is, in principle, a case for governments to intervene to provide information, especially in develop-ing countries.\n\u2022 A recently de\ufb01ned justi\ufb01cation for intervention, grounded in behavioural economics, is the idea of time-inconsistent preferences (giving rise to \u201cintra-personal\u201d externalities or \u201cinternalities\u201d): individuals seek instant grati\ufb01ca-tion (for example, the calming effect of nicotine) at the expense of their long-term best interests (for example, the resulting risk of lung cancer).\nAlthough more research is needed, these arguments can justify accepting some of the large internal costs of chronic diseases as relevant to public policy, in addition to any external costs that may exist.\nCost concepts: summary It is important to note that this section has discussed only whether there are market failures that would \u2013 in principle \u2013 justify a public policy intervention.\nThis by itself says nothing about whether, in reality, governments would have the means to correct the market failure at a cost that is outweighed by the return. Many interventions might not ful\ufb01l this criterion, in which case the optimal choice is to live with the status quo. Evidence of \u201cvalue for money\u201d (such as cost-effectiveness evidence) is needed. The link between the debate on market failure and evidence of cost-effectiveness also runs the other way: evi-dence of cost-effectiveness on its own is not a suf\ufb01cient argument to justify a 52 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee role for public policy. This is because, in the absence of a market failure, a highly cost-effective intervention may be undertaken privately.\nThe costs and bene\ufb01ts of chronic disease management The fact that chronic diseases impose a signi\ufb01cant economic burden, measured in the different ways set out in the preceding section, does not by itself necessa-rily imply that investment in chronic disease management is an economically sensible way forward. Such an assessment depends less on the costs of the exist-ing disease burden but rather on that part of the disease costs that can be averted through the intervention (hence, the bene\ufb01ts of the intervention) set against the costs of carrying out the intervention. This is what a proper \u201ceconomic evaluation\u201d should assess, and it cannot be assumed that the net bene\ufb01ts will be positive. Unfortunately, economic evaluations of chronic disease management in Europe are scarce. Therefore, this section will focus on a conceptual discus-sion, illustrated with empirical examples where available, often drawing on work from the United States, bearing in mind the limits to the transferability of such evidence.\nCosts and bene\ufb01ts of a given chronic disease management intervention differ according to the perspective taken. Table 3.4 provides a typology of the different costs and bene\ufb01ts from the four main perspectives commonly adopted: the patient, the health plan/provider, the employer and society.\nIf the maximization of societal welfare is the overarching policy objective, as in theory it should be, then the societal perspective is the \u201cright\u201d perspective to assume. However, to explain actual decision making it is often useful to under-stand the perspective of the different players, to see how they oppose and/or substitute each other, recognizing that this may ultimately produce a less than optimal societal output. This should also provide public policy makers with indications of how to alter incentives for private actors in a way that stimulates them to approximate better to the optimal societal outcome.\nCosts of chronic disease management As we assume that the patient will be enrolled in a health insurance scheme, the only direct costs carried by the patient will be those that the health insurance organization (i.e. the plan/provider) passes on to him or her, through increased premiums or out-of-pocket payments, as a result of reduced wages in response to greater employer payments for health insurance.\nThe provider of the chronic disease management programme faces three types of cost: (\ufb01xed) set-up costs (e.g. for information technology systems, staf\ufb01ng costs for the management of the programme), operating costs (primarily for human resources to deliver services in a coordinated manner) and adverse selec-tion costs (arising from increased enrolment of high-cost patients in response to the improved reputation of a given programme).\nThe costs to the employer depend on the institutional arrangements. In the context of the United States, the health plan may be in a position to require Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 53 higher premiums in return for access to the chronic disease management pro-gramme. The situation is different in Europe, where all countries provide virtually universal coverage through statutory funding systems. Where a com-bination of competing insurance funds coexist with speci\ufb01c chronic disease management programmes, as in Germany, risk-equalization mechanisms have been put in place (Busse 2004). Issues could, however, arise in relation to private insurance (Mossialos and Thomson 2002). This may be: \u2022 substitutive, where it is purchased by those outside the statutory system, typic-ally because they have high incomes \u2022 complementary, offering cover for care already within the statutory system but with greater choice of provider \u2022 supplementary, covering areas excluded from the statutory system, such as some types of dentistry.\nTable 3.4 Costs and bene\ufb01ts of chronic disease management Bene\ufb01ts Costs Patient Improved length/quality of life (net of non-monitoring costs of changing behaviours) Higher premium for health insurance (if the employer responds in this way) Out-of-pocket expenses (e.g.\ncopayments) Possible reduced wages due to greater employer payments for health insurance Plan provider Lower use of acute services over time (if the patient remains with the plan) Higher premium for disease management programme (if the health plan can charge for it) Set-up costs (e.g. computer technology) Operating costs (e.g. nurses, drugs, primary care physicians) Adverse selection costs (to a given plan) Employer Possible productivity gains (if the patient remains with the company) Possible reduced wages in exchange for better health bene\ufb01ts Higher premium paid for disease management programme (if the health plan can charge for it) Net to society Improved length/quality of life (net of non-monetary costs of changing behaviours and indirect patient costs) Potential long-term cost savings owing to lower use of acute services over time Potential productivity gains Setup costs Operating costs Adverse selection costs Source: Beaulieu et al. (2003).\n54 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee However, any consequences will be minimal, either because of the mix of sub-scribers (typically much healthier than average) or the nature of the package (complementary and supplementary schemes often exclude chronic disorders).\nBene\ufb01ts of chronic disease management There are three primary bene\ufb01ts that may be derived from improved chronic disease management: \u2022 improved health (i.e. quantity and quality of life years gained), experienced by the patient \u2022 long-term cost savings from complications avoided and healthcare utilization reduced, experienced by the plan, the providers and potentially employers) \u2022 workplace productivity gains, experienced by patients and their employers.\nAs there is often misunderstanding, it is important to emphasize that the out-come \u201cimproved health\u201d does represent an economic bene\ufb01t as much as a health bene\ufb01t. Improved health increases the lifetime consumption possibilities of individuals, thereby directly augmenting utility \u2013 the maximization of which is seen by economists to be the ultimate objective of human endeavour. The eco-nomic bene\ufb01t is thus clearly not limited to the more narrow perspective of cost savings or labour productivity gains. Therefore, a \ufb01rst essential input into the economic evaluation of any health programme is evidence of its effectiveness in terms of health improvement, measured, for instance, by the quantity and/or quality of life of the patient(s). After all, health improvement should be the primary purpose of any health intervention, and hence also the primary criterion for judging its value. If, in addition, the programme leads to cost saving and/or labour productivity gains, these are welcome side effects, but they should not be the main criterion for judging the economic desirability of a health programme.\nIf the intervention succeeds in achieving a certain health improvement at a cost that is lower than the resulting bene\ufb01t,5 then the investment is economically worthwhile irrespective of whether there are additional cost savings and/or labour productivity effects.\nAs discussed at length in the other chapters in this book, advocates of active chronic disease management seek better health outcomes than are achieved with the current more-fragmented approach. While the idea has a great deal of intuitive appeal, can it be shown whether chronic disease management in real life is actually making a positive difference to health, irrespective of any monetary considerations?\nAs the country case studies in the companion volume to this book demon-strate, relatively few evaluations have been undertaken in European countries.\nFor reasons discussed elsewhere in this book, research from the United States may be of limited relevance to the situation in Europe, not least because of the very much worse baseline that American disease management programmes are starting from. However, even in the United States, much of the evidence is inconclusive. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a real scarcity of scienti\ufb01cally solid and systematic evaluations of chronic disease management programmes. This may partly be explained by the relatively short time period Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 55 that has elapsed since chronic disease management programmes have been established in many of the countries considered here. Other factors include the serious methodological challenges involved in isolating the effects of the often complex, multicomponent chronic disease management programmes, as well as the limited investment in health services research in many European coun-tries. Finally, policy makers may be reluctant to commission comprehensive and unbiased evaluations of programmes that they \u201cbelieve\u201d are effective, or where they have been persuaded of this by those seeking to sell proprietary, almost exclusively American, models.\nIn the absence of randomized controlled trials, which have so far been applied only rarely to interventions designed to manage chronic diseases, it is dif\ufb01cult to ascertain whether the change in health status that might have been observed during the observation period can unambiguously be attributed to the speci\ufb01c chronic disease management examined. There is, however, considerable unreal-ized scope from research using observational data (Linden and Adams 2006; Linden et al. 2006a, 2006b).\nThe evaluation of chronic disease management programmes does require careful preparation and ideally has to be built into the development of the programme from the outset. Few countries have so far actively adopted the idea that evaluation (not to mention a full economic evaluation) should be an inte-gral component of public health programmes. Rare exceptions include the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the fact that evaluations have been carried out does not, by itself, say anything about their quality and hence their informative value. Very few have collected actual health outcomes, concentrating instead on the admittedly easier to obtain process indicators (such as resource use or admission rates).\nOn the basis of the evaluations reported in the companion volume, there is considerable evidence that some chronic disease management programmes do indeed improve health outcomes. Outcomes of diabetes mellitus in the Group Health Centre in Ontario, Canada, an ambulatory care centre with a group practice and multidisciplinary teams using electronic medical records, have been evaluated. The clinical outcomes measured, alongside the nine process outcomes, comprised blood pressure, serum glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum lipids. Improvements have been particularly noticeable with res-pect to blood pressure targets and HbA1c outcomes. The study in France also reported that where \u201cformal evaluations were available, the results were very positive with fewer drug prescriptions, fewer hospitalisations and lower morta-lity rate compared to a control group.\u201d The more comprehensive trials of improved care coordination for people with chronic and complex illness in Australia produced more mixed results.\nWhile in the \ufb01rst round of trials, outcomes in intervention groups were not better in terms of quality of life or hospitalization rates, readmission or length of stay (Esterman and Ben-Tovim 2002), the evaluation of the subsequent extended primary care package provides some evidence that care plans are associated with better provision and outcomes of care for diabetes (Zwar et al.\n2007). Moreover, following the introduction of the National Integrated Diabetes Program, improvements in intermediate outcomes were seen in a cohort of patients on diabetes registers (Georgiou et al. 2006). Further encouraging results 56 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee came from the evaluation of demonstration projects on self-management as part of the Sharing Healthcare Initiative. Observational studies reported positive effects on health outcomes and quality of life and reduced use of health services (Australian Department of Health and Ageing 2005).\nIf it is accepted that, on the whole, chronic disease management programmes produce health bene\ufb01ts for the patients involved, a view supported by the more comprehensive evidence from the United States, what about the other two types of expected bene\ufb01t: cost saving and labour productivity effect?\nWhile it is plausible that the health bene\ufb01ts of chronic disease management programmes result in labour productivity gains in respect of patients who are in the labour force, we are not aware of any de\ufb01nite evidence of such a causal (or even associative) link, and nor is such evidence reported in the case studies, although there is some evidence from the United States (Testa and Simonson 1998; Ng et al. 2001; Ramsey et al. 2002). There is, however, some very limited information on the impact on healthcare costs, but what exists does not encourage optimism that substantial cost savings will be realized. For instance, most evaluations in England, \u201chave found little reduction in hospital admis-sions\u201d. Likewise, in the evaluation of a regional transmural diabetes manage-ment programme in the Netherlands (Matador), there was no impact on total costs (despite a marked reduction in hospitalization rates).\nAlthough these \ufb01ndings cannot be generalized, it does suggest that, although there is some evidence from the United States to the contrary (Fendrick et al.\n1992; Persson 1995; Bodenheimer et al. 2002; Sidorov et al. 2002; Short et al.\n2003), the hope that chronic disease management programmes will be cost-cutting instruments is overoptimistic.\nFireman et al. (2004) have, however, identi\ufb01ed three ways in which chronic disease management programmes might at least in principle yield savings to the health system: quality improvement, utilization management and productivity improvement.\nQuality improvement. Chronic disease management can improve health by increasing use of effective medications and improving self-care, thereby pre-venting enough exacerbations and complications to save money.\nUtilization management. Disease management can reduce overuse through a supportive approach that is acceptable to patients. Predictably high-cost patients are given a case manager who coaches self-care and discourages inappropriate use of the emergency room, facilitates timely discharge from the hospital, prevents duplicative tests and steers patients to less-costly services.\nProductivity improvement. Disease management can of\ufb02oad work from doctors to less-costly practitioners, delivering care by telephone and via the Internet instead of traditional of\ufb01ce visits. Although disease management typically supplements usual care, it could boost productivity if delivered in ways that substitute for \u2013 or reengineer \u2013 usual care.\nHowever, in their empirical evaluation of four conditions included in disease management programmes delivered by Kaiser Permanente in Northern Califor-nia, they do not \ufb01nd cost savings even though there are improvements in qual-ity and health outcomes.\nNevertheless, even if chronic disease management (or other interventions) do not save money, they can still represent excellent value for money from a Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 57 societal perspective if they buy better health at a cost that is \u201cworth it\u201d. Typic-ally, however, the improvement in health will require additional resources, not less. At least during the initial years when a chronic disease management pro-gramme is being established, it will require very signi\ufb01cant additional start-up costs (e.g. costs for the production and dissemination of guidelines, salaries, information technology).\nAs the above discussion illustrates, there is a potential con\ufb02ict between the objective of the health plan/provider to realize a \ufb01nancial pro\ufb01t (i.e. to save money) \u2013 the \u201cbusiness case\u201d \u2013 on the one hand and the societal objective of achieving a health improvement at a reasonable (but typically positive) cost on the other hand \u2013 the broader \u201ceconomic case\u201d.6 This is a problem because what seems to be a relatively poor business case for chronic disease management reduces or even eliminates the incentives for the health plan/provider to estab-lish programmes that may bring a net bene\ufb01t to society as a whole. The reasons for such a disconnect are rooted in the current \ufb01nancing structure and delivery systems of health systems, and it is beyond the scope of this chapter to analyse these in greater detail (see Chapter 9). The greatest disconnect between the business case and the broader economic case is the fact that the private bene\ufb01ts derived by patients enrolled in a chronic disease management are not trans-ferred to the health plans and providers. Given the bene\ufb01ts patients expect from chronic disease management, it can be anticipated that the employers or pur-chasers acting on their behalf would be willing to pay a premium for participa-tion in a good-quality chronic disease management programme, but that does not appear to happen. Employers also have an incentive to pay premiums that will allow sick workers to be enrolled in chronic disease management pro-grammes, in the expectation of direct bene\ufb01ts in the form of reduced work absences and/or higher productivity, although this of course raises many com-plex issues including the possibility of covert discrimination in employment procedures against those with such disorders.\nOne of several problems that prevent such transfers from occurring is that the relationship with the patient would have to continue for perhaps ten years or more, until positive results emerge, in order for the plan/provider or the employer to be able to reap the bene\ufb01ts from any investment in chronic disease management. As such a long-term commitment is rather the exception than the rule, and as it may not be able to be enforced in the present institutional environment (a situation that is exacerbated by the tendency, in several coun-tries, to introduce the right to shift between health insurance funds, which is only partly overcome by risk-equalization mechanisms), the difference between societal and business returns remains. The only way to justify chronic disease management is then on the basis of cost saving, and, as we argued above, such savings are only likely to be realized after a prolonged period of time, if at all.\nOverall, there are a number of \u201cCatch-22\u201d situations in the current arrange-ments. The health insurer needs to \ufb01nd a way to charge the patient, employer and government for the bene\ufb01ts. This is important not only for the insurance company but also for society as a whole, because of the burden of chronic diseases and the societal cost savings from certain chronic disease management programmes. Clearly this is not such a problem in many countries in Europe, where funding comes from compulsory social insurance or national taxes.\n58 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee However even in these situations, there can be considerable power and auto-nomy devolved to providers, making it incumbent on them to achieve \ufb01nancial balance. For example, in England, health services are commissioned and pro-vided by primary care trusts and practice-based commissioners. They are given a weighted budget annually to cover populations of approximately 200,000. They face severe penalties if they fail to achieve \ufb01nancial balance annually. Given that their average chief executive remains in post for three years, it is not sur-prising that they are more interested in investing in solutions where the bene\ufb01ts can be seen quite quickly, such as improved acute services, than in facing the high initial costs for a long-term gain in chronic disease management pro-grammes. Although the government tries to compensate by setting up systems of inspection to ensure that enough is being done to tackle chronic diseases, none of this is considered important if the organization is not achieving \ufb01nancial balance.\nThese \ufb01ndings have a number of policy implications that require more exten-sive country-speci\ufb01c elaborations in future research. Most obviously, and as has been noted over the years by many commentators, there is a strong argument for ensuring that reimbursement systems pay providers on the basis of the qual-ity of the services they offer, rather than the number of services provided. The challenges are substantial and, in reality, many are insurmountable, as illus-trated by the so-called \u201cpayment-by-results\u201d system in the English National Health Service, which is, in reality, \u201cpayment by activity\u201d. Nevertheless, there is considerable scope to move to a situation where payments begin to reward health outcomes, or at least the use of processes that can, on the basis of sound evidence, be expected to achieve better outcomes. There is also an economic argument for explicit direct subsidies by government as a means of better aligning business and societal interests.\nConclusions This chapter has discussed the economic costs of chronic disease and the eco-nomic aspects of chronic disease management from a conceptual perspective, providing some empirical evidence from Europe. As for the former, we emphasized the need to make clear what type of costs we are talking about when we talk about \u201ccosts\u201d, and from which perspective. Whatever the particular cost concept applied, there is much evidence to suggest that chronic diseases are imposing a substantial cost burden on society. There is also evidence that at least part of these costs justify government intervention to prevent and control chronic disease.\nWhile there is increasing recognition that improving health can provide direct economic bene\ufb01ts at both the individual and perhaps even at the macro-economic level, there is far less information on the costs of the different ways of achieving better health, and, hence, on the \u201creturn on investment\u201d. This applies to both preventive and curative approaches, and, as we have argued in this chapter, this seems to apply with a vengeance to chronic disease management: the economic evaluation of chronic disease management is a signi\ufb01cantly underresearched issue. In great part, this is because the essential building block Economic aspects of chronic disease and chronic disease management 59 of such evaluations, that is the proof of effectiveness of such programmes, is not very advanced in the countries considered, with a few exceptions. Looking ahead, therefore, our key recommendation is to undertake much more research on whether and how far chronic disease management programmes are making a difference to health outcomes. Should this be supported by the resulting evidence on a larger scale, that in itself would also be a major step forward for any future economic assessment. Unless this evidence gap is \ufb01lled, we see very little hope that what is seen as a promising way to tackle the growing challenge of chronic diseases will gain widespread political and \ufb01nancial support in European countries.\nWe distinguished the business case from the (societal) economic case and found a worrying disconnect between the two, which unless it is overcome through appropriate \ufb01nancing and delivery mechanisms will result in the provi-sion of a socially suboptimal level of active chronic disease management, a con-sequence that will be hard to tolerate in light of the ever more pressing need to tackle the high and growing burden of chronic disease our societies will inevit-ably face. The question of how better to align the \ufb01nancial and economic incen-tives involved in chronic disease management should be high on the research agenda, and this is an issue that will be addressed in some detail in Chapter 9.\nNotes 1.\nThe costs associated with a disease or a risk factor can be measured either by the \u201cprevalence approach\u201d (assessing costs at a single point in time) or the \u201cincidence approach\u201d (assessing the costs over a lifetime). The former is by far the most common one. The more data-extensive incidence or \u201clife cycle\u201d approach estimates the present value of the cost of adding to society a person who contracts the speci\ufb01c disease or takes up a certain unhealthy behaviour (Rice 1994). Another important parameter is whether the study uses an \u201cepidemiological\u201d or an \u201ceconometric\u201d approach. The logic of the former is that it apportions a fraction of the overall medical costs to either a disease or a risk factor (using methods very similar to those that quantify mortality attributable to a speci\ufb01c disease or risk factor). The less widely practised econometric approach uses regression analysis to quantify (direct and indirect) costs while control-ling, to the extent possible, for other observable characteristics that are likely to affect cost and be correlated with the disease or the risk factor. Doing so, in fact, brings the cost-of-illness approach rather close to the microeconomic one discussed below.\n2.\nThis criticism applies speci\ufb01cally to the epidemiological approach of cost-of-illness measurement, which becomes clear from the way the costs are derived. An estimate of the costs of hospitalization directly related to, say, physical inactivity is calculated by multiplying the following three components: the percentage out of each disorder that can be attributed to physical inactivity, the number of hospitalizations by disorder and the average cost per hospital stay. Attribution of the percentages is not always straightforward, particularly so for the attribution of a given disorder to a speci\ufb01c risk factor (Sindelar 1998).\n3.\nA further limitation \u2013 already mentioned \u2013 is the limited comparability of the results across different studies of the same disease/risk factor or across different diseases/risk factors. Although such comparisons are tempting, given the seemingly similar categories used, the details of each study differ too much in most cases (Godfrey 2004).\n60 M. Suhrcke, D.K. Fahey and M. McKee 4.\nThese include a persistent problem of multicollinearity, the dif\ufb01culty of disentan-gling symptoms from causes, a wide divergence from more robust microeconomic analyses and the limited utility of results based on cross-country averages for inferring country-speci\ufb01c lessons. See Pritchett (2006) for a more extensive discussion of the limits of cross-country growth analytics.\n6.\nA particularly useful illustration of this con\ufb02ict is by Beaulieu et al. (2003) in the context of diabetes care at two major health plans in the United States; unfortunately, no similar information is available for Europe, Australia or Canada. Beaulieu et al.\nfound that improved care for diabetics has large potential net bene\ufb01ts for society as a whole but the net return to health plans and providers was negative in the \ufb01rst few years and minimal (if at all) over a decade interval.\nReferences Acemoglu, D. and Johnson, S.

Chronic illness requires complex models of care, involving collaboration among professions and institutions that have traditionally been separate. Healthcare still builds largely on an acute, episodic model of care that is ill equipped to meet the long-term and \ufb02uctuating needs of those with chronic illness. Patients may receive care from many different providers, often in different settings or institutions, even when they have only a single disease, such as diabetes. They are frequently called upon to monitor, coordinate or carry out their own treatment plan, while receiving limited guidance on how to do so. Consequently, in order to provide better support for patients, there is a pressing need to bridge the boundaries between professions, providers and institutions through the development of more integrated or coordinated approaches to service delivery (Plochg and Klazinga 2002). In response, health professionals, policy makers and institutions in many countries are increasingly recognizing the need to respond to those with complex health needs and are initiating new models of service delivery designed to achieve better coordin-ation of services across the continuum of care (Conrad and Shortell 1996; Ouwens et al. 2005).\nYet although this has a logical appeal, the available evidence on the effective-ness of different forms of integration or coordination of care remains uncertain, despite a surge of reviews, systematic and otherwise, of single interventions and complex programmes and models of care (Bodenheimer et al. 2002a; Weingar-ten et al. 2002; Ofman et al. 2004; Singh 2005a; Tsai et al. 2005; Zwar et al.\n2006). One well-known model is the Chronic Care Model (CCM), developed by Wagner et al. (1999), which we will describe in more detail below. There is now suf\ufb01cient evidence that single or multiple components of the model improve quality of care, clinical outcomes and healthcare resource use; however, it is less clear whether this is a consequence of applying the model as a whole, or whether the same bene\ufb01ts can be achieved using only some of the components (Singh and Ham 2006). Similarly, reviewing the evidence on the effectiveness of collaboration between health and social care, Dowling et al. (2004) showed that while there was some, albeit inconclusive, evidence that collaboration improved service outputs and/or user outcomes, it was not possible to establish a causal link between the various components of the collaboration and its effects.\nAlongside the relative paucity of empirical evidence on the consequences of different forms of integration, coordination and care models (Shortell et al.\n2000; Singh and Ham 2006), there is the more fundamental challenge arising from the lack of common de\ufb01nitions of underlying concepts and boundaries.\nIntegration and/or coordination have been pursued in many ways in different health systems, and there is a plethora of terminologies that have variously been described as \u201cintegrated care\u201d, \u201ccoordinated care\u201d, \u201ccollaborative care\u201d, \u201cman-aged care\u201d, \u201cdisease management\u201d, \u201ccase management\u201d, \u201cpatient-centred care\u201d, \u201cchronic (illness) care\u201d, \u201ccontinuity of care\u201d, \u201ctransmural care\u201d, \u201cseamless care\u201d and others. Kodner and Spreeuwenberg (2002) even used the biblical story of the Tower of Babel1 to illustrate this myriad of de\ufb01nitions and concepts, while Howarth and Haigh (2007) describe an \u201cacademic quagmire of de\ufb01nitions and concept analyses\u201d surrounding the notion of integration. Systematic under-standing of \u201cintegrated care\u201d and related notions has been greatly hampered by a lack in speci\ufb01city and clarity, with commonly used de\ufb01nitions tending to be \u201cvague and confusing\u201d (Kodner and Spreeuwenberg 2002), and by the more general absence of a \u201csound paradigm through which to examine the process\u201d (Goodwin et al. 2004). This confusion very much re\ufb02ects the polymorphous nature of a concept that is applied from several disciplinary and professional perspectives and is associated with diverse objectives.\nThis chapter seeks to contribute to a clearer understanding of the various de\ufb01nitions, concepts, methods and models involved. It does so by tracing the origins of two key concepts, \u201cintegrated care\u201d and \u201cdisease management\u201d, and exploring approaches to what we refer to as \u201cchronic care\u201d in different contexts.\nWe then move on to describe selected typologies, theoretical frameworks and existing delivery models for providing care for those with varying levels of need and we examine the relevant evidence base, taking advantage of the accumulat-ing evidence on the relative effectiveness of different models and components of chronic care. Where appropriate, we illustrate observations with examples from the individual country case studies that have informed this book.\nTracing the origins: the search for the common ground The lack of common ground underpinning notions of integration is, in part, attributable to the different origins of the various concepts. The terms inte-grated care and disease management may be taken to re\ufb02ect two ends of a spectrum of approaches that, ultimately, aim to ensure cost-effective quality care for service users with varied needs.\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 65 The notion of integration has its roots in organizational theory and, as it relates to welfare services, is found most prominently in contingency theory, an offshoot of systems theory, as developed by Lawrence and Lorsch (1967; quoted in Axelsson and Axelsson 2006), with its concepts of differentiation and integra-tion, the latter de\ufb01ned as \u201cthe quality of the state of collaboration that exists among departments that are required to achieve unity of effort by the demands of the environment\u201d. The concept of integrated care has mainly been discussed in the health and social care \ufb01elds in terms of linking the cure and care sector (shared care in the United Kingdom, Vernetzung in Germany, and transmurale zorg in the Netherlands). For example, Leutz (1999) de\ufb01ned integration as \u201cthe search to connect the healthcare system (acute, primary medical, and skilled) with other human service systems (e.g. long-term care, education, and vocational and housing services) in order to improve outcomes (clinical, satisfaction, and ef\ufb01ciency)\u201d. Similarly, Kodner and Spreeuwenberg (2002) de\ufb01ned integration as \u201ca coherent set of methods and models of the funding, administrative, organisa-tional, service delivery and clinical levels designed to create connectivity, alignment and collaboration within and between the cure and care sectors\u201d.\nHardy et al. (1999) described integrated care as \u201ca coherent set of products and services, delivered by collaborating local and regional health care agencies\u201d and that, through securing \u201cliaison or linkages within and between the health and social care systems\u201d, integrated care ensured that service users received com-prehensive, multiagency packages of care at the right time and enabled them to move across or through the systems to obtain different types and levels of care.\nThe application of the concept of integrated care to health and social care is not, however, clear cut. Leichsenring (2004) described several discourses or \u201csets of academic and political perspectives and approaches\u201d to integrated care that have evolved either from a predominantly healthcare perspective (managed care discourse, public health discourse) or from adopting a broader \u201cwhole systems\u201d approach that emphasizes the social services perspective (person-centred dis-course); these are complemented by an institutional discourse that focuses on organizational strategies. A strong healthcare perspective is seen in the de\ufb01nition of integrated care coined by the WHO European Regional Of\ufb01ce as \u201ca concept bringing together inputs, delivery, management and organization of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and health promotion.\nIntegration is a means to improve services in relation to access, quality, user satisfaction and ef\ufb01ciency\u201d (Groene and Garcia-Barbero 2001). Person-centred approaches, in contrast, have evolved from a tradition that emphasizes \u201cdemedi-calization\u201d by underlining the interdependencies between health and social care in meeting the needs of the individual service user (Leichsenring 2004). The boundaries between these \u201cdiscourses\u201d remain ambiguous, however. This is, in part, because approaches to integrated care pursued in different systems re\ufb02ect, to a great extent, the \ufb01nancing and organization of, and responsibilities for, health and social care in a given country. For example, Niskanen (2002), arguing from a healthcare perspective, de\ufb01ned integrated care as including \u201cthe methods and strategies for linking and coordinating the various aspects of care delivered by different care levels\u201d, that is, by primary and secondary care. However, because he is using Finland as his basis, his de\ufb01nition includes social services since supporting long-term care needs is the duty of the social care sector.\n66 E. Nolte and M. McKee This notion of integrated care in the context of publicly funded systems is somewhat different from that which Shortell et al. (1994), from a United States perspective, referred to as integrated (or organized) delivery systems: \u201ca network of organisations that provides or arranges to provide a coordinated continuum of services to a de\ufb01ned population and is willing to be held clinically and \ufb01scally accountable for the outcomes and the health status of the population served\u201d.\nThis de\ufb01nition re\ufb02ects a strong managed care perspective in that the emphasis is on de\ufb01ned (but selective) populations (i.e. enrolled members of a given health plan who pay a predetermined monthly premium) and on integrating the \ufb01nancing and provision of healthcare, which in the United States, as in other countries with insurance-based systems, have traditionally been strictly separated (Maynard and Bloor 1998). The concept of integrated delivery in the United States context is not easily comparable with integrated care as interpreted in the European context, where it traditionally refers to the integration of different sectors (i.e.\ncure and care) rather than different functions (\ufb01nancing and delivery). It should, however, be noted that several elements of what has been described as managed care, such as case management, form integral parts of many integrated care approaches. Consequently, several authors have linked or equated inte-grated care with managed care (Hunter and Fair\ufb01eld 1997; Ovretveit 1998; Vondeling 2004).\nThe unifying \u201cdenominator\u201d of integrated care concepts and approaches is their primary aim of improving outcomes for the target population (Ovretveit 1998), traditionally the frail elderly and other population groups with diverse and complex needs. Therefore, according to Leutz (1999), the goal of integra-tion is to bene\ufb01t populations that have \u201cphysical, developmental, or cognitive disabilities \u2013 often with related chronic illnesses or conditions.\u201d The focus is on service users with multifaceted problems who require assistance with activities of daily living. Social care thus forms an essential component in the spectrum of user need. Kodner and Spreeuwenberg (2002) also de\ufb01ned the overall aim of integrated care as being to \u201cenhance quality of care and quality of life, consumer satisfaction and system ef\ufb01ciency for patients with complex, long-term prob-lems cutting across multiple services, providers and settings\u201d.\nIn contrast, disease management has traditionally targeted persons with a single (chronic) disease or condition. Disease management was \ufb01rst mentioned as a concept in the United States in the 1980s and initially used mainly by pharmaceutical companies offering educational programmes to employers and managed care organizations to promote medication adherence and behaviour change among patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma and coronary artery disease (Bodenheimer 1999; Boston Consulting Group 2006). A \u201cchild of cost controllers\u201d (Bodenheimer 1999), disease management concepts were seen as a means to reduce hospital (re)admissions and hospital days \u2013 though the incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to enter the market was driven, in part, by the prospect of increasing sales of their products and also to circumvent a perceived risk of falling pro\ufb01ts from prescription drugs purchased by managed care organizations in the early 1990s.\nFrom the mid-1990s, disease management strategies were adopted more widely by the healthcare industry in the United States, in parallel with an emer-ging body of evidence suggesting the potential for cost savings in the treatment Integration and chronic care: a review 67 of those with chronic conditions (Krumholz et al. 2006). By 1999, around 200 companies offered disease management programmes for conditions such as diabetes, asthma and congestive heart failure; at the same time, health main-tenance organizations, medical groups and hospitals increasingly provided in-house disease management too (Bodenheimer 2000). It has been estimated that between 1997 and 2005 the revenues of disease management organizations in the United States grew by around 40% (from US$78 million to $1.2 billion), with much of the growth occurring in the late 1990s, slowing down somewhat in the early 2000s (Boston Consulting Group 2006).\nPayers in the United States, and indeed elsewhere, have now \u201cwidely embraced [disease management] initiatives\u201d (Boston Consulting Group 2006).\nThis also includes the United States federal government, which has been devel-oping and piloting a voluntary chronic care improvement programme under the fee-for-service Medicare system for the over 65s (Medicare Health Support, launched in 2005), targeting diverse population groups with heart failure and/ or diabetes and delivered by private disease management organizations (McCall et al. 2007). Individual states have also developed and implemented disease management programmes within their Medicaid programmes (Gillespie and Rossiter 2003); over half of the states have some form of disease management in place under Medicaid (Smith et al. 2006). In 2005, two-thirds of employers with 200 or more employees offered disease management through their employment-based health insurance plans, and more than half of employees with such insurance were enrolled in a disease management programme (Geyman 2007). However, the nature and scope of such programmes varies widely, ranging from \u201csmall initiatives focused on a narrow subset of members to widespread programs targeting almost all chronically ill members across multiple payer groups\u201d (Boston Consulting Group 2006).\nIt is important to emphasize that as the disease management \u201cindustry\u201d has evolved over time, two key trends have emerged that are relevant to the discus-sion here. First, amid the variety of programmes operating under the broad label \u201cdisease management\u201d, there are two basic types of initiative: \u201con-site\u201d pro-grammes that are directed by the primary provider and delivered within a primary care setting and \u201coff-site\u201d or \u201ccarved-out\u201d programmes that focus on speci\ufb01c processes of care or clinical outcomes, mostly patient education and self-management based on information systems (Cavanaugh et al. 2007).\nCarved-out programmes are normally offered by commercial for-pro\ufb01t vendors, such as specialized disease management organizations, and are marketed to employers and health insurers primarily as a cost-containment strategy (Bodenheimer 2000; Geyman 2007). As carved-out programmes, commercial disease management programmes are not integrated with primary care and normally involve only minimal communication with primary care providers (Geyman 2007). Additionally, they often lack any focus on patient outcomes or they concentrate on short-term outcomes only, one reason why disease management \u201chas a pejorative connotation to some people\u201d (Norris et al. 2003).\nAt the same time there has been a trend towards developing a broader, population-based approach to disease management (Geyman 2007). Early pro-grammes tended to focus on single conditions or diseases, with commercial programmes targeting patient education and adherence to drug therapies, as 68 E. Nolte and M. McKee mentioned above; more recently, second-generation disease management pro-grammes have evolved that shift the focus to addressing the multiple needs of patients with comorbidities and multiple conditions (Boston Consulting Group 2006; Geyman 2007). Indeed, as Krumholz et al. (2006) have noted \u201c[b]ecause disease management programmes have historically provided narrowly tailored medical solutions focused on one dominant health problem, several . . . alterna-tive models have arisen in an attempt to provide a more integrated approach to care, directing attention to the wide range of patient comorbidities\u201d. As with off-site disease management programmes, this has led to the development of administrative databases and disease registration systems designed to identify individuals at risk (Cavanaugh et al. 2007).\nAs a consequence of these developments, and re\ufb02ecting the situation with integrated care, there is now a wide range of de\ufb01nitions of disease management that vary in scope, focus, purpose and range of component interventions (Norris et al. 2003). De\ufb01nitions range from \u201cdiscrete programs directed at reducing costs and improving outcomes for patients with particular conditions\u201d (Rothman and Wagner 2003) to \u201ca population-based systematic approach that identi\ufb01es persons at risk, intervenes, measures the outcomes, and provides con-tinuous quality improvement\u201d (Epstein and Sherwood 1996). Ellrodt et al.\n(1997) de\ufb01ned disease management as \u201can approach to patient care that coordinates medical resources for patients across the entire delivery system\u201d, indicating that the boundaries between \u201cdisease management\u201d and \u201cintegrated care\u201d have become increasingly blurred.\nThis confusion is further illustrated by a recent overview of systematic reviews that aimed to assess the effectiveness, de\ufb01nitions and components of integrated care programmes for chronically ill patients (Ouwens et al. 2005). Of the 13 systematic reviews considered, eight were, in fact, reviews of disease manage-ment programmes, each employing a distinct de\ufb01nition of disease manage-ment, with the remainder reviewing some form of care or case management (two), multidisciplinary teams/structures (two), and more generally manage-ment of patients with chronic health problems (one) (Box 4.1). Although very diverse in scope and content, the programmes reviewed shared the common goal of reducing fragmentation and improving continuity and coordination, the very features identi\ufb01ed here as characteristic of integrated care approaches.\nIn conclusion, there is considerable overlap between concepts of \u201cintegrated care\u201d and broader perspectives of \u201cdisease management\u201d. From the review presented here, it may legitimately be argued that the common theme is the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for those with (complex) chronic health problems by overcoming issues of fragmentation through linkage of services of different providers along the continuum of care. However, while concepts of integrated care frequently link with the social care sector, disease management programmes are normally limited to linkages within the healthcare sector.\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 69 Addressing the needs of people with chronic conditions: an overview of frameworks and models Building on the experience with and evidence from interventions that aim to address the needs of persons with chronic conditions, numerous frameworks and models have been developed since the 1980s or so designed to optimize care. Given the overlap between concepts of integrated care and disease management, this section begins with an overview of taxonomies of integra-tion before moving on to describe selected frameworks and delivery models that have been most in\ufb02uential in informing approaches to chronic disease management.\nBox 4.1 \u201cAlternative\u201d care concepts Care concepts that are frequently, though not always, subsumed under the heading of, or are used interchangeably with, disease management include \u201ccase management\u201d, \u201ccoordinated care\u201d and \u201cmultidisciplinary care\u201d (Krumholz et al. 2006). Again, boundaries are not clear cut. There-fore, while disease management frequently targets speci\ufb01c diseases or conditions, case management and multidisciplinary care are generally aimed at those with multiple or complex needs, for example the frail eld-erly. Although de\ufb01nitions and approaches vary (Roberts 2002; Sargent et al. 2007), one feature of case management is the goal of reducing the use of (unplanned) hospital care (Gravelle et al. 2007) through the develop-ment of care or treatment plans that are tailored to the needs of the indi-vidual patient who is at high risk socially, \ufb01nancially and medically (Krumholz et al. 2006). Patients are assigned a case manager, often a (specialist) nurse, who oversees and is responsible for coordinating and implementing care (Norris et al. 2002).\nMultidisciplinary care has been referred to as an \u201cextension\u201d of case management in that it also normally involves the development of treat-ment plans tailored to the medical, psychosocial and \ufb01nancial needs of patients, but in contrast to case management utilizes a broader range of medical and social support personnel (including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, social workers and others) to facilitate transition from inpatient acute care to long-term outpatient management of chronic illness (Krumholz et al. 2006). Similarly, coordinated care, also used inter-changeably with case or care management, involves the development and implementation of a therapeutic plan designed to integrate the efforts of medical and social service providers, often involving designated indi-viduals to manage provider collaboration.\n70 E. Nolte and M. McKee Taxonomies of integration As indicated in the previous section, integrated care is a concept that has been widely but variously used. At the same time, the notion of integration provides a useful way of thinking about a range of approaches that are deployed to increase coordination, cooperation, continuity, collaboration and networking across dif-ferent components of health service delivery. There have been several attempts to develop a taxonomy of integration in healthcare that would enable system-atic assessment of the structures and processes involved, their prerequisites and their effects on healthcare organization and delivery and, ultimately, on user outcomes. A key challenge is that, unlike in many other industries, products and production stages in healthcare, and boundaries between them, are not always easy to de\ufb01ne (Simoens and Scott 1999). Importantly, users of health services do not progress linearly through the system towards a common \ufb01nal production stage and, given the probabilistic nature of the treatment process, providers need to be able to cope with uncertain demand at each stage of the process. The integration process in healthcare is, therefore, unlikely to follow a single path and variations are inevitably common. Accordingly, ana-lysts have distinguished different dimensions of integration, with the most common taxonomies differentiating the type, breadth, degree and process of integration.\nType of integration. The literature differentiates functional integration (extent to which key support functions and activities such as \ufb01nancial management, human resources, strategic planning, information management and quality improvement are coordinated across operating units), organizational integra-tion (e.g. creation of networks, mergers, contracting or strategic alliances between healthcare institutions), professional integration (e.g. joint working, group practices, contracting or strategic alliances of healthcare professionals within and between institutions and organizations) and clinical integration (extent to which patient care services are coordinated across the various per-sonnel, functions, activities and operating units of a system) (Shortell et al.\n1994; Simoens and Scott 1999; Delnoij et al. 2002).\nThe breadth of integration. This refers to the range of healthcare services provided. Horizontal integration takes place between organizations or organiza-tional units that are on the same level in the delivery of healthcare or have the same status; vertical integration brings together organizations at different levels of a hierarchical structure (Conrad and Shortell 1996; Simoens and Scott 1999; Axelsson and Axelsson 2006).\nThe degree of integration. This ranges from full integration, that is the inte-grated organization is responsible for the full continuum of care (including \ufb01nancing), to collaboration, which refers to separate structures where organiza-tions retain their own service responsibility and funding criteria (Leutz 1999; see also below).\nThe process of integration. This distinguishes between structural integration (the alignment of tasks, functions and activities of organizations and healthcare professionals), cultural integration (convergence of values, norms, working methods, approaches and symbols adopted by the (various) actors), social inte-gration (the intensi\ufb01cation of social relationships between the (various) actors) Integration and chronic care: a review 71 and integration of objectives, interests, power and resources of the (various) actors (Fabbricotti 2007).\nIn summary, integration may occur in different and complex structural con-\ufb01gurations, re\ufb02ecting the diverse environments and historical paths taken by health systems and the range of options available to establish and maintain linkages among their various components.\nFrameworks and delivery models in chronic care Drawing on a comparison of initiatives to integrate health and social services in the 1990s in the United States and the United Kingdom, Leutz (1999) noted that strategies tended to focus on a (relatively small) subset of the population with high need while overlooking the needs of the (majority) of chronically ill and disabled people with \u201cless\u201d need (Leutz 2005). Leutz (1999), therefore, proposed an \u201cintegration framework\u201d that describes three levels of integration which are set against dimensions of service users\u2019 need and operational domains of sys-tems; this would enable a comprehensive approach responding to the varied needs of all persons with chronic and/or disabling conditions.\nDimensions of need were de\ufb01ned in terms of stability and severity of the patient\u2019s conditions, duration of illness, urgency of the intervention, scope of services required and the user\u2019s (or carer\u2019s) capacity for self-direction. The vari-ous service domains were structured into (i) systems to identify persons with disabilities (screening), (ii) clinical practices responsive to the needs of these persons, (iii) management of transitions across settings, (iv) information gather-ing and exchange, (v) case management, (vi) management of funds from multiple payment sources, and (vii) coordination of bene\ufb01ts.\nFollowing this line of reasoning, Leutz (1999) divided service users into three groups: those with mild-to-moderate but stable conditions, a need for a select few routine care services and with high capacity for self-direction or strong informal networks; those with moderate levels of need; and those with long-term, severe, unstable conditions who frequently require urgent intervention from various sectors and who have limited capacity for self-direction. Leutz (1999) argued that the \ufb01rst group would be likely to be served suf\ufb01ciently by relatively simple, though systematic, \u201clinkage\u201d of different systems. These do, however, require each provider to be aware of and to understand the other providers in terms of health and social care needs, \ufb01nancing responsibilities and eligibility criteria (Figure 4.1). Linkage would operate through the separate structures of existing health and social services systems, with organizations retaining their own service responsibilities, funding and eligibility criteria and operational rules (Goodwin et al. 2004).\nThe next level, coordination for groups with moderate levels of need, also would operate mainly through systems existing in different sectors but would involve additional explicit structures and processes, such as routinely shared information, discharge planners and case managers, to coordinate care across the various sectors.\nAt the far end of the spectrum, the last subgroups with long-term, severe, unstable conditions were likely to bene\ufb01t most from a high level of integration 72 E. Nolte and M. McKee of the different service domains (Leutz 1999). Such a \u201cfully\u201d integrated system would assume responsibility for all services, resources and funding, which may be subsumed in one managed structure or through contractual agreements between different organizations (Goodwin et al. 2004).2 In the healthcare sector, one example of what has been described as a \u201cfully integrated system\u201d is provided by Kaiser Permanente, a health maintenance organization in the United States.3 Goodwin et al. (2004) identi\ufb01ed a series of key attributes that characterize integrated delivery systems such as that of Kaiser Permanente, including: a population de\ufb01ned by enrolment, contractual responsibility for a de\ufb01ned package of comprehensive healthcare services, \ufb01nancing on the basis of pooling multiple funding streams, a \u201cclosed\u201d network (i.e. a selected group of contracted and/or salaried providers), emphasis on pri-mary care and non-institutional services, use of micromanagement techniques to ensure appropriate quality of care and to control costs (e.g. utilization review, disease management) and multidisciplinary teams working across the network with joint clinical responsibility for outcomes.\nA key feature of the approach taken by Kaiser Permanente to chronic care is the application of a population management (or care) model that divides the insured population of patients with chronic conditions into three distinct groups based on their degree of need (Bodenheimer et al. 2002a). Patients at level 1 have, in Leutz\u2019s terms, a relatively low level of need for healthcare: their chronic condition is reasonably under control, with support for self-management of their condition provided through the primary care team. This population constitutes the majority of the population with chronic conditions.\nFigure 4.1 Levels of integration and user need.\nSource: Adapted from Leutz (1999).\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 73 In contrast, level 2 patients are considered at increased risk because their condi-tion is unstable or because they could deteriorate unless they have structured support through specialist disease management. Finally, level 3 includes indi-viduals with highly complex needs and/or high intensity use of unplanned secondary care (i.e. emergency admissions) who require active management through case managers. This approach has also become known as the Kaiser Permanente \u201ctriangle\u201d or \u201cpyramid of care\u201d, as illustrated in Figure 4.2.\nKaiser Permanente\u2019s approach to management of patients with chronic con-ditions has evolved over time (Fireman et al. 2004). The focus was, initially, on care and case management of high-risk patients (Bodenheimer et al. 2002a) but it has gradually expanded to include the entire population with chronic disorders at all three levels of healthcare \u201cneed\u201d.\nOne other in\ufb02uential service delivery model addressing the needs of high-risk patients in particular, also originating in the United States, is the Evercare model developed in the late 1980s for the Minnesota government by UnitedHealth Group, a for-pro\ufb01t health plan (UnitedHealth Europe 2005). Its overall aim is to combine preventive and responsive care for patients at high risk of deterioration in their health. The Evercare model comprises a form of case management that, initially, targeted vulnerable elderly in Medicare-contracted nursing homes who were at increased risk of unplanned hospital admission (Boaden et al. 2006). The programme uses risk-strati\ufb01cation tools to assess the level of care required and to inform the development of an individual care plan that is coordinated and monitored by a specialist nurse (advanced practice nurse) acting as case man-ager. More recently, the programme has been extended to older patients living in the community.\nThe approaches taken by Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealth Group involve distinct delivery models targeting speci\ufb01c segments of the patient population.\nOthers have developed broader frameworks that, based on the available research Figure 4.2 Population management levels of care.\nSource: Adapted from Department of Health (2005).\n74 E. Nolte and M. McKee evidence, have sought to guide the delivery of effective healthcare to people with chronic conditions by taking an explicit community or systems perspec-tive, frequently involving comprehensive system change (Wagner 1998).\nPerhaps the most in\ufb02uential framework has been the Chronic Care Model (CCM) developed by Edward Wagner and colleagues in the United States (Wagner et al. 1999). Recognizing the failures of health systems that remain largely built on an acute, episodic model of care with little emphasis on patient self-management, the CCM aimed to provide a comprehensive framework for the organization of healthcare to improve outcomes for people with chronic condi-tions (Wagner et al. 2001). It was based on the premise that high-quality chronic care is characterized by productive interactions between the practice team and patients, involving assessment, self-management support, optimization of ther-apy and follow-up. Drawing on a synthesis of the evidence of effectiveness of various (chronic) disease management interventions, the CCM comprises four interacting system components that are considered key to providing good chronic care: self-management support, delivery system design, decision sup-port and clinical information systems (Wagner et al. 1996, 1999). These are set in a health system context that links an appropriately organized delivery system with complementary community resources and policies (Figure 4.3).\nThe CCM has been implemented in, or has guided, the (re-)design or recon-\ufb01guration of healthcare services in numerous settings across the United States (Pearson et al. 2005; Zwar et al. 2006). Internationally, it has been in\ufb02uential in informing chronic care policies in countries including Australia (Glasgow et al. 2008), Canada (British Columbia; (Jiwani and Dubois 2008)), and England (Department of Health 2005) (Box 4.2), with analysts in Germany Figure 4.3 The Chronic Care Model.\nSource: Reprinted from Effective Clinical Practice, 1: 2\u20134, Wagner: Chronic disease management: What will it take to improve care for chronic illness, \u00a9 1998, with permission from the American College of Physicians.\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 75 recommending adoption of the CCM\u2019s principles in the existing countrywide approach to disease management introduced in 2002 (Gensichen et al. 2006).\nRecognizing that some aspects of the CCM are not easily translatable inter-nationally, and in particular to low-resource settings, the WHO, in collabor-ation with Wagner, applied a global perspective to the CCM to create the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions framework (WHO 2003; Epping-Jordan et al. 2004). In brief, the framework is based on a set of guiding principles acting at three levels. The micro level emphasizes the partnership between patients/fam-ilies, healthcare teams and community partners. The meso level refers to the healthcare organization and community, with a particular emphasis on the need for continuity and coordination as well as for \u201corganized and well-equipped\u201d healthcare teams rather than decision support, in recognition that decision-support tools may not be applicable in low-resource settings. The macro level, \ufb01nally, explicitly considers the policy and \ufb01nancing contexts, which are seen as key factors in any successful system response to chronic conditions (Epping-Jordan et al. 2004).\nThere are numerous other service delivery models and broader frameworks directly or indirectly targeted at people with chronic conditions (Singh and Box 4.2 International adaptations of the Chronic Care Model In 2000, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) set up a chronic care program that involved a variety of approaches including the appointment of care coordinators for people with chronic conditions and encouraging multidisciplinary team approaches involving physicians, nurses and other allied health professionals (NSW Department of Health 2004). The experience of the \ufb01rst phase of the programme was mixed, however, so a second phase adopted a broader approach, including the development of a NSW chronic care model (NSW Department of Health 2004). Work is underway during this second phase to de\ufb01ne the key elem-ents of such a model, which is expected to draw, to a considerable extent, on the Chronic Care Model (Wagner et al. 1999) and the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions framework to develop a model that is applic-able to the local context.\nIn England, in 2005, the government launched a bespoke NHS and Social Care Model designed to help health and social care organizations to improve care for people with chronic conditions (Singh and Fahey 2008).\nThe model built on approaches such as the Chronic Care Model, the \u201cKaiser triangle\u201d and the Evercare model, adapted to the values and struc-tures of the NHS in England (Department of Health 2005). It outlines how people with chronic conditions will be identi\ufb01ed and will receive care according to their needs. The stated principles driving the NHS and Social Care Model are an improvement in the quality and accessibility of care for people with chronic conditions and containment or reduction of the costs associated with chronic care (Singh and Fahey 2008).\n76 E. Nolte and M. McKee Ham 2006). The discussion here has concentrated on some of the more in\ufb02uen-tial models, most prominently the CCM, which have been designed to improve the quality of care and, ultimately, outcomes for those with (complex) chronic conditions. Still, as indicated in the introduction to this chapter, while com-prehensive models such as the CCM appear plausible and \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d, the available evidence on their effectiveness remains uncertain. Indeed, while there is now ample evidence that single or multiple components of the CCM improve selected processes and outcomes of care, it is less clear whether the model as a whole is essential to achieve the same bene\ufb01ts (Singh and Ham 2006). The next section revisits some of the evidence and remaining uncertainties as they relate to the CCM and its components.\nWhat is the evidence?\nBodenheimer et al. (2002b) reviewed studies of diabetes care programmes that featured components of the CCM, building on an earlier Cochrane review by Renders et al. (2000). The most frequent interventions used in the pro-grammes reviewed (and the elements of the CCM they relate to) were patient education and training (CCM component: self-management support); edu-cational materials and meetings for physicians (CCM: decision support); use of case managers, multidisciplinary teams and scheduling of planned visits (CCM: delivery system design); and reminder systems and feedback on physician per-formance (CCM: clinical information system). Out of 39 studies, 32 found the intervention to improve at least one process or outcome measure. However, the authors noted dif\ufb01culties in establishing a direct relationship between the number of CCM components and/or speci\ufb01c combinations of CCM com-ponents and overall effectiveness. They also noted that the studies included in their review varied in terms of methodological quality and rigour and, import-antly, that reported \ufb01ndings were frequently derived from a research setting and were thus not necessarily reproducible in the population at large.\nBodenheimer et al. (2002b) reviewed a further 27 individual studies of inter-ventions related to the CCM and their impact on healthcare utilization and cost in the management of congestive heart failure, asthma and diabetes. Again, self-management support was among the commonest CCM component employed, forming an integral part of all interventions studied. About half of the interven-tions also used some delivery system redesign, such as the introduction of follow-up by home visits, multispeciality teams, nurse-led clinics and case man-agement (mostly for congestive heart failure and diabetes). The \ufb01ndings were mixed however, with some interventions in each disease category showing posi-tive results (e.g. a reduction in healthcare utilization through reduced hospital admissions or visits to emergency departments) and/or cost reductions, while others did not. The authors acknowledged that it would be dif\ufb01cult to draw any general conclusions since, again, the studies included in their review assessed speci\ufb01c programmes undertaken in research settings rather than a permanent change in the delivery of chronic care; also, where interventions did achieve a cost reduction, this may not be sustainable in the long run.\nWeingarten et al. (2002) conducted a meta-analysis of 118 disease manage-Integration and chronic care: a review 77 ment programmes that were evaluated in 102 studies (randomized controlled trials, before\u2013after studies, interrupted time series). The meta-analysis focused on evidence of the effectiveness of different types of intervention used in disease management programmes for patients with chronic conditions. Disease management was de\ufb01ned as \u201can intervention designed to manage or prevent a chronic disease using a systematic approach to care and potentially employing multiple treatment modalities\u201d (Ellrodt et al. 1997). A systematic approach was further de\ufb01ned as \u201cmethodologically developed statements assisting prac-titioner and patient decision making about appropriate healthcare for speci\ufb01c clinical circumstances\u201d such as guidelines, protocols, care plans, standardized education and others (Weingarten et al. 2002): all interventions that may be considered under the CCM headings.\nAs with \ufb01ndings obtained by Bodenheimer et al. (2002b), patient education formed an integral part in most disease management programmes (92 of 118) studied, whereas provider education (47 of 118) was used widely only for selected conditions (depression, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia). The number and combination of interventions varied, with around 40% using only a single intervention while 35% used two interventions, 20% used three and approximately 5% used four (Weingarten et al. 2002). Those using provider education, feedback and/or reminders achieved signi\ufb01cant improvements in provider adherence to care guidelines. It was, however, impossible to determine which interventions produced the greatest relative improvement in care, as the studies included in the meta-analysis did not directly compare different interventions. Comparisons were also complicated by the diversity of interven-tions used for each condition. Consequently, the authors argued that there was a paucity of available information to guide programme development and de\ufb01ne an optimal strategy.\nIn a related study, Ofman et al. (2004) revisited the analysis by Weingarten et al. (2002), focusing in particular on the quality of patient care as measured by selected process and outcome measures. While many disease management programmes reviewed were found to be associated with improvements in the quality of care, improvements were greatest for patient satisfaction with treat-ment, patient adherence to treatment recommendations, and measures of dis-ease control. The \ufb01ndings seem to suggest that disease management may be an effective strategy for changing the behaviours of patients and providers. How-ever, the authors warned that improvements in outcomes may be only modest even though evaluation of the effects of disease management programmes in rigorous studies published in the peer-reviewed literature may \ufb01nd statistically signi\ufb01cant improvements in processes of care (Ofman et al. 2004). The review further demonstrated that relatively few studies included measures of utiliza-tion, such as emergency department visits or hospitalizations, or costs; of those that did, few found bene\ufb01cial effects and \ufb01ndings tended to be relatively modest and inconsistent. Also, as the authors note, there is, as yet, relatively little evidence regarding the long-term bene\ufb01ts in terms of economic impact and \ufb01nancial return on investment associated with the development and imple-mentation of disease management programmes (see also Congressional Budget Of\ufb01ce (2004) and Chapter 3). This observation is further reinforced by other work, which reported that bene\ufb01cial effects of disease management on measure 78 E. Nolte and M. McKee of utilization appears to be limited to congestive heart failure and the evidence that disease management may result in a net reduction of direct medical costs is at best inconclusive (Mattke et al. 2007).\nThere is now a wide range of systematic reviews, reviews of reviews and meta-analyses of the evidence on (chronic disease-) speci\ufb01c interventions and disease management programmes that share selected components of the CCM (e.g.\nVelasco-Garrido et al. 2003; Gonseth et al. 2004; Neumeyer-Gromen et al. 2004; Knight et al. 2005; Singh 2005a, 2005b; Tsai et al. 2005; Adams et al. 2007).\nFocusing particularly on the primary care setting, Zwar et al. (2006) recently examined the evidence on the effectiveness of the six CCM elements when tested experimentally. Using a systematic review and a review of reviews, they identi\ufb01ed a series of key elements and interventions shown to be effective for selected process and outcome measures, as summarized in Table 4.1.\nTable 4.1 Summary of evidence on effectiveness of the components of the Chronic Care Model Component Interventions shown to be effective Outcome measures affected Patient self-management support Patient educational sessions Patient motivational counselling Distribution of educational materials Physiological measures of disease Patient factors: quality of life, health status, functional status, satisfaction with service, risk behaviour, knowledge, service use, adherence to treatment Delivery system design Multidisciplinary teams Physiological measures of disease Professionals adherence to guidelines Patient service use Decision support Implementation of evidence-based guidelines Educational meetings with professionals Distribution of educational materials among professionals Professionals adherence to guidelines Physiological measures of disease Clinical information systems Audit and feedback Professionals adherence to guidelines Healthcare Organization Little published experimental evidence Community resources Little published experimental evidence Source: adapted from Zwar et al. (2006).\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 79 Similar to other reviews, the elements that were identi\ufb01ed as impacting most consistently on clinical and patient outcome measures were self-management support and delivery system design, in particular when in combination, with decision support and clinical information systems important factors in\ufb02u-encing guideline adherence by health professionals. However, much of the evidence reviewed related to the management of adult patients with type 2 diabetes, potentially limiting the transferability of \ufb01ndings to other chronic conditions. Also, there was little evidence on the impact of the broader CCM system components involving healthcare organization and/or community resources, which the authors attributed, in part, to the challenges faced in designing experimental studies of these elements (Zwar et al. 2006).\nImportantly, although the CCM has been widely embraced as key to effective chronic disease management and, as the reviews by Zwar et al. (2006) and others have demonstrated, while its elements have been tested in various combin-ations and found to lead to some improvement in patient outcomes as outlined above, evidence on the impact of the model as a whole is scarce (Singh and Ham 2006). Indeed, the entire model has only recently been evaluated. For example, using an experimental design, Piatt et al. (2006) assessed the impact on clinical and behaviour outcomes of patients with diabetes of implementing the CCM in a small sample of primary care practices in an under-served area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The study found marked improvements after 12 months for two of the clinical outcomes and for self-monitoring of blood glucose in the CCM group compared with two other groups (provider intervention; usual care), but all other outcome measures were not signi\ufb01cantly improved.\nTwo linked studies provided an evaluation of the implementation of the CCM by a medical group in Minneapolis, United States. Solberg et al. (2006) asked whether the delivery of care consistent with the six CCM components was cor-related with improvements in the quality of care for patients with diabetes, coronary heart disease or depression. Care quality was measured as the propor-tion of patients who had achieved both of two separate guideline-recommended goals speci\ufb01c to their condition. The analysis showed how both the implemen-tation of most CCM elements and the quality of care for patients with diabetes and coronary heart disease had improved over a period of two years. However, the authors were unable to establish a signi\ufb01cant correlation between these changes. They further demonstrated how two of the six CCM elements, self-management support and delivery system design, which elsewhere were suggested to be potentially the most important elements for improving clinical and patient outcomes (e.g. Singh 2005a; Zwar et al. 2006), failed to achieve signi\ufb01cant improvements.\nThe same group also undertook a qualitative evaluation of the implementa-tion process (Hroscikoski et al. 2006). Their analysis identi\ufb01ed several barriers to successful implementation, including too many competing priorities, lack of speci\ufb01city of changes and of agreement about the care process changes desired, and little engagement of physicians. Based on their \ufb01ndings, the authors con-sidered the value of the CCM to lie in its contribution as a practical guide to successful implementation. Speci\ufb01cally, Hroscikoski et al. (2006) noted that \u201c[a]s a conceptual framework, the CCM is useful for thinking about types of care process needing to be addressed\u201d. However, as argued by these authors, the 80 E. Nolte and M. McKee CCM may not provide suf\ufb01cient practical guidance to assist decision makers with the actual changes to be made to the care process.\nIn summary, as judged by the published literature, the evidence remains inconclusive on the impact of applying the CCM as a whole on quality of care and patient outcomes, as does the evidence about which components, in what combination, achieve the greatest improvements of what process, output and/ or outcome measures. What seems to be emerging is that the implementation of single interventions in isolation is not suf\ufb01cient to improve the quality of chronic illness care (Rothman and Wagner 2003), but models that adopt an explicit patient-oriented approach are likely to have the greatest effects on patient outcomes (Zwar et al. 2006). However, much of the research evidence is on the management of a few speci\ufb01c diseases, such as diabetes. There has been less focus on individuals with coexisting conditions or multiple health prob-lems (Piette and Kerr 2006; Struijs et al. 2006), even though it is this rapidly increasing population, with multiple disease processes and with diverse and sometimes contradictory needs, who pose the greatest challenge to health systems (Chapter 2). Also, research has concentrated on immediate to short-term outcomes only; relatively little is known about the long-term impact of approaches to chronic disease management, particularly as it relates to clinical and patient outcomes (Bailie et al. 2006). Importantly, available evidence seems to suggest that the impact of chronic disease management interventions will depend, to considerable extent, on the speci\ufb01c features of the healthcare setting within which they are introduced, and this observation seems to hold both within and between care systems. This issue will be examined brie\ufb02y in the following section.\nThe system context of chronic disease management Much of the conceptual thinking and empirical evidence originates from the United States, which is characterized by a highly fragmented system of general-ist and specialized care and where the baseline outcomes from common chronic diseases such as diabetes are worse than, for example, in Europe (Nolte et al.\n2006). Perhaps in response to this situation, a wide range of innovative approaches to disease management have been developed to improve the quality of care for those with chronic illness (Rothman and Wagner 2003). However, given differences in health systems, in particular as they relate to coverage and access, \ufb01ndings originating from the United States may not easily be transfer-able to healthcare systems that are characterized by (almost) universal access to healthcare such as those in Europe.\nFor example, the application of the Evercare approach to case management described earlier has been associated with reduced costs of care for older people living in nursing care homes in the United States. This was achieved through the reduced use of health services such as hospitalizations and use of emergency services (Kane et al. 2004; UnitedHealth Europe 2005). This approach was later adopted in England, with policy makers envisaging Evercare\u2019s experience as a means to free up hospital resources through targeted case management of high-intensity users or people at high risk of hospitalization (Boaden et al.\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 81 2006). This move was guided by the observation of substantial resource use by patients with complex conditions; for example, approximately 15% of people with three or more chronic problems were found to account for almost 30% of inpatient days (Wilson et al. 2005). Starting with pilots of the Evercare model of case management of frail elderly people in nine primary care trusts in England from April 2003 (UnitedHealth Europe 2005), case management subsequently became part of the United Kingdom government\u2019s national policy for support-ing people with chronic conditions. The 2004 NHS Improvement Plan stipulated the introduction of case management in all primary care trusts through the appointment of senior nurses (community matrons) by 2007 (Department of Health 2004; see also Chapter 7). The anticipated bene\ufb01ts included improved quality of care and, by preventing or delaying complications, reduced (emer-gency) admissions and long hospital stays.\nYet these expectations seem not to be justi\ufb01ed. Two reviews found that the evidence that case management prevented admissions to acute care and use of emergency departments was weak (Hutt et al. 2004; Singh 2005a). In both cases, the authors argued that the \ufb01ndings from studies in one healthcare setting could not be generalized easily to others, and the effectiveness of complex approaches to case management is, therefore, likely to depend on the nature of the intervention and on the nature of the target population and the care system into which it is introduced. This conclusion is supported by the evaluation of the \u201cEvercare pilot\u201d in the NHS in England, which failed to \ufb01nd the gains in lower emergency admissions and bed-days that would be expected based on the potential cost savings suggested for the Evercare model in the United States (Gravelle et al. 2007) (Box 4.3).\nCase management has now become a key component of the national com-munity matron policy in England, whereby senior nurses (matrons) act as case managers. Yet, as indicated by the \ufb01ndings of Boaden et al. (2006), while com-munity matrons may be popular with patients and increase access to care, the policy on its own is unlikely to reduce hospital admissions in the absence of a more radical system redesign.\nSimilar conclusions were drawn from a series of studies undertaken within in the Veterans Health Administration in the United States, which provides healthcare for military veterans in the United States and which, with its inte-grated structure, has many features in common with systems such as the United Kingdom NHS. These studies suggested that use of case management or coordination strategies alone did not lead to reductions in hospital (re-) admis-sions of patients with complex needs; only subsequent major system-wide changes incorporating a range of strategies that also encouraged greater use of primary care services were associated with reduced admission rates (Kizer et al.\n2000).\nA recent study by Schmittdiel et al. (2006) assessed the association between primary care orientation (see below) and implementation of the CCM in a cross-sectional sample of United States medical groups and independent practice associations that had more than 20 physicians treating patients with chronic disease. Measures of primary care orientation were adapted from the work by Barbara Star\ufb01eld and colleagues (for an overview see Star\ufb01eld et al. (2005)), who identi\ufb01ed a series of core practice features of primary care, such as the 82 E. Nolte and M. McKee extent of gatekeeping, continuity/longitudinality, comprehensiveness, degree of service coordination and accountability. Implementation of the CCM was measured in terms of \ufb01ve elements: community linkages, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support and clinical information sys-tems. These were then subdivided into 11 dimensions. The study found that of the eight measures indicating primary care orientation, six (representing level of comprehensiveness, accountability and coordination) were signi\ufb01cantly and positively associated with adoption of 11 dimensions of the CCM. Schmittdiel et al. (2006) concluded that organizations \u201cthat have adopted 6 core attributes of primary care . . . appear to use more chronic care management practices\u201d. The nature of the study, using a cross-sectional design, does not allow determination of the direction of causality (i.e. whether greater primary care organization facilitates implementation of CCM elements or vice versa). However, the \ufb01nd-ings suggest that a strong primary care orientation may positively impact on the adoption of elements of chronic disease management and, consequently, sys-tems elsewhere that are characterized by strong primary care orientation are likely to \ufb01nd it easier to introduce practices that bene\ufb01t those with chronic conditions.\nBox 4.3 Case management in England Gravelle et al. (2007) analysed the impact on patient outcomes of the Ever-care pilot, which introduced case management for elderly people in England. This involved a before and after analysis of hospital admissions data in 62 general practices implementing the Evercare model (April 2004 to March 2005). A key feature of the approach is the use of specialist nurses (advanced practice nurses) who monitor and coordinate the care of patients at risk according to individual care plans designed to improve a patient\u2019s functional status and quality of life and avoid hospital admis-sions. In a linked qualitative study, Boaden et al. (2006) highlighted the improvements in quality of care, such as frequency of contact, regular monitoring, psychosocial support and a range of referral options, that had not previously been provided to frail elderly people, but Gravelle et al.\n(2007) were unable to demonstrate any signi\ufb01cant effects of the interven-tion on rates of emergency admissions, emergency bed-days and mortality for a population aged over 65 years at high risk for hospitalization. Gravelle et al. (2007), therefore, concluded that the implementation of case man-agement of frail elderly people in England introduced an additional range of services into primary care but did not lead to an associated reduction in hospital admissions. While this lack of an association might be attribut-able, in part, to additional cases being identi\ufb01ed, the overall \ufb01ndings of this evaluation do not support the use of nurse practitioners as a means to reduce hospital admissions in patients who have had previous emergency admissions (Gravelle et al. 2007; Sargent et al. 2007).\nIntegration and chronic care: a review 83 This consideration is important because the nature of primary care varies considerably within Europe. At the risk of generalization, the model found in the United Kingdom also exists in the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries.\nPrimary care is based largely on multiprofessional teams of physicians, nurses and other health professionals (Ettelt et al. 2006). Patients are registered with a particular primary care facility, which acts as a gatekeeper to secondary care. In many countries where strong primary care teams exist, there has been a progres-sive shift in the management of many chronic diseases to nurse-led clinics in primary care (Box 4.4). There is now considerable evidence from various coun-tries and for different diseases that this approach yields better results than trad-itional physician-led care, and it may also reduce costs (Singh 2005b; Vrijhoef et al. 2001), although the model cannot be generalized universally (Smith et al.\n2001; see also Chapter 7).\nIn contrast, in most of the countries in Europe where healthcare is funded through social insurance, there is free choice of family practitioners and special-ists working in ambulatory care. In this model, physicians are much more likely to work as individual practitioners and, as in many systems in the United States, the ambulatory and hospital sector tend to be strictly separated. As a con-sequence, countries such as Germany have tended to follow the United States Box 4.4 Nurse-led clinics in Sweden Nurses play an increasingly prominent role in the Swedish healthcare system through advanced care of patients with chronic and complex con-ditions such as diabetes and asthma; they also have limited authority to prescribe (Buchan and Calman 2005). By the late 1990s, two-thirds of hospitals ran nurse-led heart failure clinics, based on clinical protocols and with nurses empowered to change medication regimens within those protocols (Stromberg et al. 2001).\nNurse-led clinics are now common at primary healthcare centres and in hospital polyclinics across Sweden, managing diabetes and hypertension and with some also managing allergy/asthma/chronic obstructive pul-monary disease, psychiatry and heart failure (Karlberg 2008). The total number of nurse-led clinics in Sweden is dif\ufb01cult to assess; however, such clinics are established in almost every medical department and primary healthcare centre. While there are no signi\ufb01cant regional differences in the number and design of nurse-led clinics, their staf\ufb01ng depends on the catchment area; one or more diabetes nurses may work with, among others, dieticians, foot therapists, surgeons and diabetes physician/ endocrinologists.\nThe main reasons behind the growth in nurse-led clinics are both eco-nomic and to create new career opportunities for nurses. One other aspect is the development of a more patient-centred system that facilitates access, through telephone consultations and support for elderly persons with communication dif\ufb01culties.\n84 E. Nolte and M. McKee approach by introducing structured disease management programmes for selected conditions. Preliminary evidence indicates some success in terms of uptake and patient outcomes (Nordrheinische Gemeinsame Einrichtung Disease Management Programme GbR 2004; Petro et al. 2005) and systematic evalu-ations are underway (e.g. Joos et al. 2005). However, these are additional services that have not altered the general structure of primary care in the country (Siering 2008) and currently focus on single conditions only. Consequently, the current approach does not seem suf\ufb01cient to meet the needs of the majority of patients with chronic disease (Gensichen et al. 2006; Siering 2008).\nConclusions There is now an emerging consensus that the effective management of complex chronic diseases represents one of the greatest challenges now facing health systems. There is also a substantial consensus that this will require new ways of delivering healthcare, involving integration of care providers or, at least, much closer coordination of their activities. Yet beyond these areas of agreement, there is much less consensus about how this should be achieved. In part, this is a result of the plethora of terminology involved, which tends to confuse rather than clarify. Frequently, the same words mean very different things to different people. However, it also re\ufb02ects the reality that health systems exhibit the prop-erty of path dependency, whereby the options to go forward are constrained by what has happened in the past. Each health system is characterized by a particu-lar set of relationships between the different professionals and institutions that deliver care, and change must take account of what is possible (although, where constraints created by the existing system are insurmountable, more radical approaches may be needed). For both of these reasons, it cannot be assumed that a model of care developed in one setting can be transplanted to another.\nThe experience of implementing United States models in the United Kingdom demonstrates the pitfalls that may arise. It does, however, seem that innovative models of care can be more easily implemented in health systems where there is a strong orientation to primary care, with a single point of access to the health system providing continuity.\nThe decision on how to move forward must be made for each health system.\nIt is appropriate to begin by determining the nature of the integration being pursued, including the type, breadth, degree and process of integration. It should also take account of the very diverse population of people with chronic disorders, some of whom will require only that the services they need com-municate with each other while others will need carefully managed and tightly integrated services so that no-one falls through the gaps.\nThere are now a number of models that policy makers can learn from as they seek a solution that is appropriate to their needs. The CCM has the advantage of a sound theoretical underpinning, identifying key elements that should be con-sidered in any strategy. However, the policy maker is handicapped, \ufb01rst, by the paucity of high-quality evidence available on the different elements of the CCM and similar approaches and, second, by the even more limited evidence on trans-ferability of such models to different systems. Perhaps the only area where there Integration and chronic care: a review 85 is some degree of certainty is that innovative models of care cannot be relied on to yield cost savings. There is a clear need for many more evaluations of the innovations being introduced in Europe in order to expand this evidence base.\nNotes 1.\nIn the Bible this was a tower built in an attempt to reach heaven, which God frus-trated by confusing the languages of its builders so that they could not understand one another (Genesis 11:1\u20139) (Soanes and Stevenson 2005).\n2.\nBuilding on the same notion of a continuum, others have re\ufb01ned this approach fur-ther (Goodwin et al. 2004; Ahgren and Axelsson 2005). For example, Ahgren and Axelsson (2005) distinguished \ufb01ve levels: (i) full segregation, the complete absence of any form of integration between services; (ii) linkage; (iii) coordination in networks; (iv) cooperation, where organizations or organizational units are still separate but closely coordinated by appointed network managers; and (v) full integration, a \u201cnew\u201d organization that pools funds from the various sources and is responsible for the entire spectrum of services.\n3.\nKaiser Permanente is a collaboration of three distinct legal entities: the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (includes the insurance and \ufb01nancing activities), Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (owns large parts of the physical assets of the delivery system, including hospitals and clinics) and the Permanente Medical Groups (responsible for care delivery). The eight regionally based Permanente Medical Groups are organized and operated as autonomous multispecialty group practices; each has a medical ser-vices agreement with the payer (KHFP-H) and is responsible for the organization and provision of the necessary medical care for members in the given geographical region (Wallace 2005).\nReferences Adams, S., Smith, P., Allan, P. et al.

Novotny Introduction This chapter will address the prevention of chronic diseases, as the future burden of these diseases in Europe and globally will be determined in large part by the reduction in the major risk factors for such diseases, including tobacco use, obesity/diet, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyle and certain infectious diseases. Further, the chapter will consider the in\ufb02uences on these risk factors of distal factors, such as demo-graphic changes, poverty and other social determinants, globalization and the environment. It will present examples of effective prevention efforts in both the individual and population-based context and it will conclude by outlining the speci\ufb01c role of health systems in preventing chronic disease.\nRisk factors for chronic diseases in Europe Trends in risk factors and in the burden of disease associated with speci\ufb01c risk factors have been evaluated thoroughly in recent scienti\ufb01c reports, including Ezzati et al. (2004) (Comparative Quanti\ufb01cation of Health Risks) and Lopez et al.\n(2006) (Global Burden of Disease and Risk Factors). Quantifying these risk factors and the disease burden attributable to them is key to understanding how to prevent chronic diseases through appropriately targeted health policies. Since its publication in 1990, the approach outlined in the Global Burden of Disease has become the main method to assess the impact of disease on health systems and populations and to provide the basis for setting research priorities. It pro-vides a common metric to describe disease burdens using diagnostic categories from the International Classi\ufb01cation of Diseases and their major risk factors.\nReaders are referred to the online technical material in Lopez et al. (2006) (http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD) for detailed description of methodologies.\nThe basic schema to understand the relationship between social and environ-mental determinants, risk factors, and health outcomes is shown in Figure 5.1.\nTo refresh the reader\u2019s memory on risk factors and how they can be considered causal for chronic diseases, it may be helpful to consider the following \ufb01ve causal criteria (Hill 1965): \u2022 consistency of the association \u2022 strength of the association \u2022 speci\ufb01city of the association \u2022 temporal relationship of the association \u2022 coherence of the association.\nThis chapter will mainly focus on an additional criterion for asserting causality, namely that the removal of the risk factor will be associated with a reduction in disease. Prevention can reduce the burden of chronic disease by reducing exposure to risk factors; the prevention framework should include primary, secondary or tertiary approaches. Brie\ufb02y, primary prevention works before the onset of disease (e.g. preventing young people from becoming addicted to smoking to prevent lung cancer); secondary prevention works on those with early signs of or preconditions of chronic disease (e.g. hypertension screening in clinic patients to control this condition and prevent stroke); and tertiary prevention works on those with established disease to reduce disability and morbidity (e.g. taking low-dose aspirin after the \ufb01rst myocardial infarct to prevent recurrence).\nThe importance of distal risk factors such as socioeconomic status, demo-graphic changes, globalization, environmental disadvantages and inadequate information on risk factors for chronic disease must be emphasized at the outset. Much evidence has been reported, especially since the 1960s, that the health of individuals and populations is fundamentally determined by their social and physical environments (Marmot and Wilkinson 2006). Those with the least knowledge about health risks suffer from an asymmetry of infor-mation: knowledge of risk associations and disease, the long-term health con-sequences of these risks, and the dif\ufb01culty of abandoning such risks is much more dif\ufb01cult for those below the poverty line and for those with the least access to healthcare than for others. A thorough discussion of these determinants is beyond the scope of this chapter, but health systems interactions with them will be discussed.\nIn this chapter, risk factors and determinants for chronic disease (Table 5.1) will be disaggregated and individually addressed with respect to the European Figure 5.1 Overview of the burden of disease framework.\nSource: Adapted from Mathers et al. (2002).\nPreventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 93 situation. The chapter will focus on tobacco use, obesity/diet, hypertension, alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyle and infectious diseases. In\ufb02uences on chronic disease to be discussed with regard to prevention include demographic changes, globalization, health systems, and the built environment.\nTobacco use Tobacco use as a preventable risk factor for chronic disease has perhaps been studied more than any other. The main chronic diseases concerned are cancers, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, and there is no longer any doubt as to the role that tobacco use plays in their development (Department of Health and Human Services 2004). There is also substantial evidence on the causal relationship between several chronic diseases and exposure to passive smoking (Department of Health and Human Services 2006). Tobacco use acts in synergy with other risk factors to cause cardiovascular disease (hyper-cholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension), thus multiplying risk for cardiovascular disease as these various risk factors cluster.\nThere is now substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a number of prevent-ive efforts at both the population and individual level of intervention in differ-ent national settings (Jha and Chaloupka 2000; Department of Health and Human Services 2004). In California, where a comprehensive tobacco control programme has been in place since approximately 1990, adult smoking preva-lence declined at a faster pace than for all the other states (Siegel et al. 2000).\nDuring 1988\u20131997, age-adjusted incidence of lung cancer declined 14% in California compared with only 2.7% in other parts of the United States (Centers Table 5.1 Deaths and burden of disease attributable to common risk factors, 2001 Chronic disease risk factors Low and middle income (No. (%)) High income (No. (%)) World (No. (%)) Deaths DALY Deaths DALY Deaths DALY Smoking 3340 (6.9) 54,019 (3.9) 1462 (18.5) 18,900 (12.7) 4802 (8.5) 72,919 (4.7) High blood pressure 6223 (12.9) 78,063 (5.6) 1392 (17.6) 13,887 (9.3) 7615 (13.5) 91,950 (6.0) High cholesterol 3038 (6.3) 42,815 (3.1) 842 (10.7) 9431 (6.3) 3880 (6.9) 52,246 (3.4) Overweight and obesity 1747 (3.6) 31,515 (2.3) 614 (7.8) 10,733 (7.2) 2361 (4.2) 42,248 (2.8) Low fruit and vegetable intake 2308 (4.8) 32,836 (2.4) 333 (4.2) 3982 (2.7) 2641 (4.7) 36,819 (2.4) Physical inactivity 1559 (3.2) 22,679 (1.6) 376 (4.8) 4732 (3.2) 1935 (3.4) 27,411 (1.8) DALY, disability adjusted life years.\nSource: Lopez et al. (2006).\n94 T.E. Novotny for Disease Control and Prevention 2000). One would also expect a rapid decline in heart disease mortality, and, in fact, Fichtenberg and Glantz (2000) reported 33,300 fewer deaths than expected compared with the rest of the United States.\nIn Finland, the European model for cardiovascular risk reduction is the North Karelia Project, wherein reductions in multiple cardiac risk factors have pro-duced substantial falls in cardiovascular mortality since the early 1970s. In this community, where a comprehensive cardiovascular disease prevention pro-gramme was implemented in 1972, changes in mortality were signi\ufb01cantly greater than in the rest of Finland between 1969 and 1982 (Figure 5.2).\nThe annual decline in mortality from ischaemic heart disease in men was 2.9%, whereas in the rest of Finland it was 2.0%. Among women the respective average annual declines in mortality were 4.9% and 3.0%. Smoking cessation was a major part of this programme (Sankila 2003).\nLung cancer mortality may be reduced by smoking cessation, both at the population level and at the individual level (Figure 5.3). Clearly, the bene\ufb01ts of quitting at an earlier age are far greater than those who wait until middle age or later to quit.\nLung cancer mortality rates among men have peaked or are decreasing in all European countries except for Hungary and Spain (Brennan and Bray 2002).\nThese trends reinforce the evidence for the effectiveness of any tobacco control programmes that can reduce smoking prevalence on lung cancer mortality (as an indicator disease for all smoking-attributable chronic illnesses). The evidence from across Europe is that chronic diseases caused by tobacco use can be pre-vented if a large proportion of current smokers can quit and fewer new smokers are recruited. However, in central and eastern Europe, the actions of the tobacco industry, coupled with sociodemographic and economic stresses, bode ill for the future in tobacco control (Levintova and Novotny 2004; Bobak et al. 2006).\nTobacco interventions There is clear evidence for the effectiveness of several speci\ufb01c prevention approaches in tobacco control, articulated by the World Bank (Jha and Chalo-upka 2000) and reemphasized by the Disease Control Priorities Project (2007).\nBrie\ufb02y, the effective interventions are as follows.\nHigher prices for cigarettes. Evidence from many developed countries indicates that the price elasticity of cigarette demand ranges from \u22120.25 to \u22120.50, mean-ing that a 10% price increase for cigarettes will reduce cigarette smoking by 2.5 to 5.0% (Chaloupka et al. 2000). Importantly, this means that tax rises will both increase government revenues and reduce smoking prevalence.\nPublic smoking bans. Comprehensive restrictions on cigarette smoking in pub-lic places may reduce smoking prevalence rates by 5 to 15% (Woolery et al.\n2000) and are important in changing social norms relating to smoking.\nPublic information. The \u201cinformation shocks\u201d provided by the 1962 United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians Report and the 1964 United States Sur-geon General\u2019s Report on the Health Consequences of Smoking led to signi\ufb01-cant reductions in cigarette consumption, with initial declines of 4\u20139% and longer-term cumulative declines of 15\u201330% (Kenkel and Chen 2000).\nPreventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 95 Bans on advertising and promotion. Comprehensive bans may achieve up to 6% reduction in cigarette consumption if coupled with strong tobacco control pro-grammes in other areas. Partial bans can be expected to have little effect owing to the proven capacity of the tobacco industry to subvert the intent of such restrictions (Saffer and Chaloupka 2000).\nSmoking cessation. Reductions in smoking-attributable mortality will only be seen if cessation is more widely adopted by current smokers.

Novotny assistance includes self-help manuals, community-based programmes, and min-imal or intensive clinical interventions, but there is signi\ufb01cant evidence for the use of nicotine-replacement and/or pharmacological therapy with bupropion (Novotny et al. 2000), which can increase quit rates by a factor of two or three.\nControlling smuggling. This is really the only useful supply-side intervention according to World Bank research (Merriman et al. 2000). In effect, restricting the availability of cheap, smuggled cigarettes increases the price, thus making smuggling control a demand-side approach. Such controls depend on reducing corruption, establishing tracking mechanisms and monitoring the efforts of the tobacco industry in support of smuggling.\nOther interventions. There is little evidence to support an effect with restric-tions on sales to minors, prohibitions of cigarette sales in general or agricultural interventions such as crop substitution and diversi\ufb01cation (Jacobs et al. 2000).\nOne particularly important multinational approach recently implemented is the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which is the \ufb01rst-ever health treaty made by the WHO. This treaty calls for implementation of adver-tising bans, labelling restrictions, actions to tackle smuggling, higher prices, restrictions on smoking in public places, increased cessation services and other evidence-based approaches, enacted by means of domestic law but obligated under the international treaty. In the future, similar multinational agreements may be useful in terms of food policy, alcohol policy and harmonization of prevention practices.\nFigure 5.3 Cumulative risk of lung cancer mortality men in the United Kingdom, based on 1990 smoking rates.\nSource: Adapted from Peto et al. (2000).\nPreventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 97 Overweight and obesity Energy balance is determined by caloric intake and physical activity, so con-sequently nutritional excess as well as socioenvironmental and demographic changes such as urbanization may lead to increased levels of overweight/obes-ity. As incomes increase, dietary changes may favour high-fat fast foods, in\ufb02u-enced by the globalization of food markets. Although awareness of the problem is rising, the International Obesity Task Force (2003) showed that, excluding Portugal, over 50% of people living within each European Union Member State (EU before May 2004) were failing to meet at least three of the four dietary and health targets set by the WHO regarding healthy diets (WHO 2003). Almost a third of all people living in Europe are overweight, de\ufb01ned as a body mass index (kg/m2) of 25 or greater (30 or greater is considered to indicate obesity). Over-weight varies signi\ufb01cantly by age, with older age groups showing higher preva-lence (up to 57% of men in western Europe at age 70\u201379 years) (James et al. 2004).\nChildhood obesity is already considered an epidemic in Europe. According to a 2003 study by the London-based International Obesity Task Force, 14 million of the 77 million children living in the European Union are overweight (Figure 5.4). This number, given current trends, is predicted to rise by 400,000 each year.\nObesity negatively impacts on blood pressure, blood cholesterol and lipid levels, and the metabolic effects of insulin, leading to the onset of diabetes mellitus. In addition, respiratory diseases, chronic musculoskeletal problems, osteoporosis, gall bladder disease, infertility and adverse dermatological condi-tions are associated with obesity. The main issues are, however, cardiovascular disease, diabetes type 2 and some cancers, including breast cancer. Europe has a Figure 5.4 Overweight and obesity in the European region.\nSource: Reprinted from International Obesity Task Force (2003). Waiting for a green light for health?

Novotny high burden of diabetes mellitus attributable to weight gain compared with other global regions (Figure 5.5).\nThe global epidemic of diabetes mellitus is of great concern to governments because of the secondary complications (visual, orthopaedic, renal, dermato-logical, etc.) that lead to premature mortality and disability and impose signi\ufb01cant \ufb01scal burdens on health systems and society.\nObesity and diabetes interventions From the preceding discussion, it becomes clear that obesity is a vexing problem in a \u201cglobalized\u201d world. There appears to be little new in the world of cost-effective interventions, but increasingly governments must consider a more paternalistic approach as a public good in the battle against the growing, and critically costly, epidemic of obesity and diabetes. The following policy actions may eventually have traction in preventing obesity in Europe (Gostin 2007).\nPublic information and disclosure. Inform consumers through easily under-stood labels on packaged foods, of the risks from added sodium, fat and sugar, such as the traf\ufb01c-light schemes. Canada and the United States mandate label-ling of trans-fatty acids on prepackaged foods. Informed consumers are essential if social norms are to change.\nTargeting children and adolescents. Studies suggest that advertising can signi\ufb01-cantly shape the eating habits of children and youth and the purchasing patterns of their parents. Regulating the content of food advertising to pre-vent misleading messages directed toward young people may protect them from ill-advised lifelong eating patterns.\nTaxation of unhealthy food. Some public-health advocates have proposed a \u201cfat tax\u201d as an economic disincentive on highly promoted unhealthy food products.\nFigure 5.5 Proportion of diabetes attributable to weight gain by region for adults aged over 30 years.\nSource: Adapted from James et al. (2004).\nPreventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 99 The WHO recognizes the in\ufb02uence of price on food choices and supports such a \ufb01scal approach. In addition, subsidies or tax policies may be provided by gov-ernments to encourage healthy food choices at the agricultural level, insti-tutional food programme level or at the trade level. In Poland and the Czech Republic, changes in food policies were associated, as they were in Finland, with marked reductions in body mass index and subsequent reduced cardiovascular disease burden (McKee and Zatonski 1998).\nThe built environment. The built environment in many poor communities does not support healthy living, including access to nutritional foods, recre-ational facilities and safe places for outdoor activity. Governments could use planning laws to limit the invasion of fast-food outlets and provide incentives to stores that sell nutritious and affordable foods.\nFood prohibitions. Owing to the scienti\ufb01c evidence linking trans-fatty acids to cardiovascular disease, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no safe consumption level for this food element nor that it provides any bene\ufb01t to human health (Instutute of Medicine 2005). Denmark was the \ufb01rst country to restrict the percentage of trans-fat in foods, and New York City recently restricted arti\ufb01cial trans-fat in all restaurants.\nPrimary prevention is the most important approach to obesity control. In 1998, the European Commission funded a major study, coordinated by the University of Crete, to gather existing evidence on health promotion pro-grammes addressing nutrition, diet and lifestyles and to develop an action plan for European dietary guidelines (European Commission 2000). The study describes population goals for nutrients and lifestyle for the prevention of chronic diseases in Europe (Table 5.2).\nThis approach to multinational standard setting may have signi\ufb01cant implica-tions for health systems, national policy and, ultimately, individual human behaviour. In terms of nutrient intakes, for example, available data indicate that few European nations have diets containing less than 30% of dietary energy from fat, and that only three have intakes of less than 35% dietary energy from fat. Since 1960, cereal consumption has fallen by approximately 25%. Nutrient intakes may be addressed in school programmes, public information campaigns, direct counselling of patients in healthcare settings and other means.\nLooking more speci\ufb01cally at the potential contribution of health services in preventing or reducing obesity, screening, counselling and chemoprevention are important, although the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is variable and dif\ufb01cult to determine. Using quality-adjusted life years saved as an end-point, Cawley (2007) reported a range of costs for primary, secondary and ter-tiary preventions from US$4305 for school-based interventions to US$35,600 for bariatric surgery (Table 5.3).\nSome researchers have pointed out that physical activity and diet are cost-effective for prevention of diabetes (Narayat et al. 2006), but the actual delivery of these types of intervention is highly context speci\ufb01c and requires intensive monitoring and policy backing to assure adherence.\nThe evidence presented here makes it clear that multiple interventions at the social, health system and individual levels will be necessary simultaneously if the looming obesity and consequent diabetes crises in Europe is to be addressed effectively.\n100 T.E. Novotny Hypertension Globally, approximately 14% of deaths and 6% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are attributable to hypertension, with a higher proportion (17.6% of deaths and 9.3% of DALYs) in developed countries. Over the long term, damage to the heart and cardiovascular system resulting from uncontrolled hyperten-sion represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality for ischaemic heart disease, stroke and end-stage renal disease. Underlying renal diseases also even-tually produce hypertension, which then leads to ischaemic heart disease, the single largest cause of death in developed countries. Hypertension must be con-sidered in the context of multiple cardiac and vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, smoking and sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, the approach to hypertension must not be singular but should be combined with reduction strategies for other ischaemic heart disease risk factors; this is most effectively addressed through comprehensive programmes at both the popula-tion and individual clinical levels. At the individual level, the predicted 10-year Table 5.2 Population goals for nutrients and features of lifestyle consistent with the prevention of major public health problems in Europe Component Population goals Levels of evidence Physical activity levels > 1.75 ++ Body mass index 22\u201322 ++ Dietary fat as percentage of energy intake < 30 ++ Fatty acids as percentage total energy Saturated <10 ++++ Trans <2 ++ Polyunsaturated fat intake n-6 4\u20138 g +++ n-3 2 g linoleic acid + 200 mg very long chain acids ++ Carbohydrates as percentage total energy > 55 +++ Sugary food consumption (occasions per day) \u22644 ++ Fruit and vegetables (g/day) > 400 ++ Folate from food (\u00b5g/day) > 400 +++ Dietary \ufb01bre > 25 (or 3 g/MJ) ++ Sodium (expressed as sodium chloride) (g/day) <6 +++ Iodine (\u00b5g/day) 150 (infants, 50; pregnancy, 200) +++ Exclusive breast feeding Approximately 6 months +++ Levels of evidence: ++++, multiple double-blind placebo-controlled trials; +++, single study of double-blind analyses (breast feeding: series of non-double-blind analyses); ++, ecological analyses compatible with non-double-blind intervention and physiological studies; +, integration of multiple levels of evidence by expert groups.\nSource: European Commission (2000).\nPreventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 101 cardiovascular disease risk for someone with blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg can vary from 5 to 50% depending on the number of concomitant risk factors (Jamison et al. 2006). At the population level, clinical trials indicate that a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure would result in a 32% reduction in stroke risk and a 14% relative reduction in ischaemic heart disease risk in the general population.\nHypertension interventions Continuous blood pressure reduction will slow the progression of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and many forms of renal disease in individual patients. The generally agreed threshold for treating hypertension is systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg. The distinction between primary and secondary prevention in hypertension is unnecessary from a population health perspective. Patients with a family history, multiple risk factors and no overt history of ischaemic heart disease require treatment, and those with a positive history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke or renal disease need careful attention to reduce their multiple risk factors.\nRisk factor reduction programmes for multiple risks include weight loss, healthy diet (high in potassium and low in sodium, low fat, adequate fruit and vegetable consumption), physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption (Chobanian et al. 2003). Although there is clear evidence for the ef\ufb01cacy of antihypertensive (and anticholesterol) medications to reduce ischaemic heart disease outcomes, patient adherence is notoriously problematic.

Novotny of education, attentive monitoring based on clinical practice guidelines, and easy-to-use \ufb01xed-dose therapies have been shown to improve adherence.\nAn intriguing pharmacological approach to multiple risk factor reduction proposes use of a \u201cpolypill\u201d involving four medications (Wald and Law 2003).\nThis includes a statin to reduce cholesterol, folic acid to reduce arterial plaque formation, low-dose aspirin to prevent platelet adhesiveness and an antihyper-tensive drug to lower blood pressure. The polypill strategy has been proposed as a population-based intervention to prevent ischaemic heart disease and stroke for all persons aged 55 and older or all those with existing cardiovascular disease. Estimates of ischaemic heart disease and stroke reduction are as high as 80%, and the bene\ufb01ts of a \ufb01xed-dose combination medication with proved component effectiveness has generated considerable discussion regarding costs, regulatory approaches and clinical effectiveness (Sleight et al. 2006).\nAlcohol abuse Alcohol-related diseases account for approximately 4% of global DALYs each year, while the \ufb01gure for eastern Europe is 10.7%. Approximately 75% of this disease burden is chronic illness, including alcohol dependence, vascular disease such as hypertension, hepatic cirrhosis and various cancers. Injuries (particularly road traf\ufb01c accidents) contribute a substantial portion of the DALYS (25%) (Jamison et al. 2006).\nPolicies to combat alcohol abuse Policies on alcohol abuse are, in many cases, analogous to those on tobacco use.\nTaxing alcohol raises the price and thereby reduces consumption. Advertising bans may reduce the social acceptability of excess drinking. Sales of alcohol may be restricted to limited licensed retail outlets, minimum ages, or limited hours.\nStrictly enforced drunk-driving laws discourage excessive drinking and prevent traf\ufb01c accidents. These measures require effective enforcement and laws, includ-ing policing, regulatory enforcement on licensing, and education of alcohol sellers to reduce illegal sales to minors or inebriated persons. In limited quan-tities, alcohol consumption may have some measurable effects on cardiac dis-ease prevention among those with a preexisting risk (which excludes almost all people under the age of 40), but alcohol abuse is a tremendously costly and vexing public health problem.\nClinical treatment of alcoholism includes individual counselling, therapeutic support communities such as Alcoholics Anonymous and family therapy.\nAlcohol dependence is in part genetically determined but is also related to social factors, mental health, quantities and frequency of consumption, and marketing by the alcohol industry. Multiple policy approaches as well as inte-gration of brief advice, screening and referral within clinical settings may reduce the disease burden caused by alcohol abuse. The clinician has a par-ticular role to play in determining individual risk for alcohol-related medical and psychosocial problems. Non-directive interviewing and counselling have been shown to be effective in identifying and addressing problem Preventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 103 drinking prior to the onset of chronic disease consequences (Burge and Schneider 1999).\nSedentary lifestyle Regular physical activity is a key element in weight control and prevention of obesity (International Agency for Research on Cancer 2002). In addition, regular physical activity reduces the risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, type 2 dia-betes, colon and breast cancer, osteoporotic fractures, osteoarthritis and depres-sion. Important health bene\ufb01ts have been associated even with walking for half an hour each day, but greater reductions in risk are seen with longer dur-ations of physical activity and more intense activity. Increasingly, there are less opportunities and motivations in developed nations to engage in sports, phys-ical work or a physically active home life (Koplan and Dietz 1999). Dramatic reductions in physical activity also occur as a result of urbanization, with less access to walking and bicycle riding, and mechanization of labour. This is discussed further below in the section on the built environment.\nInterventions promoting physical activity Physical activity is especially important for the healthy development of chil-dren and young people, and physical activity will improve physical well-being and reduce the impact of chronic disease among older people, especially cardio-vascular disease and diabetes. Speci\ufb01c advice by health providers on physical activity may improve self-care by providing manageable targets for patients.\nIn Europe, targets for physical activity level (PAL; the ratio of total daily energy expenditure to estimated basal metabolic rate) have been developed as a sort of prescription that may be offered to patients by providers (the target of over 1.75 is 60\u201380 minutes walking daily to avoid weight gain and 30 minutes per day to prevent cardiovascular diseases and diabetes) (Table 5.2).\nWeight-bearing exercises also reduce age-related bone loss and maintain mus-cular strength. These outcomes, in turn, prevent stumbling and reduce the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As noted above, socially disadvantaged populations tend to be less active in their leisure time because they are less able to access programmes and facilities, and they are more likely to live in neigh-bourhoods suffering from crime and traf\ufb01c safety concerns, which both create barriers to physical activity.\nOpportunities for physical activity need to be created close to where people live. Local governments have a crucial role to play in creating such environments and for programmes encouraging physical activity and active living.\nInfectious diseases Growing evidence is emerging for an aetiological role for several infectious agents, particularly viruses, in human cancer. Prominent among these is hepa-titis B virus and human papilloma virus (HPV), offering the potential for 104 T.E. Novotny prevention of hepatic carcinoma and cervical cancer, respectively, through tar-geted immunization. A bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which is a cause of stom-ach cancer, can be easily treated with antibiotics. Other carcinogenic infectious agents include liver \ufb02ukes, schistosomes, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes simplex, and T-lymphotrophic viruses. Infectious agents causing chronic disease include hepatitis C virus (causing an acute infection and chronic active hepatitis), human immunode\ufb01ciency virus (HIV, causing the acquired immunode\ufb01ciency syndrome (AIDS), which is now considered a chronic disease in countries where antiretroviral therapy has reduced mortality signi\ufb01cantly). Overall, there would be 26.3% fewer cancers in developing countries (1.5 million cases per year) and 7.7% in developed countries (390,000 cases) if these infectious diseases were prevented. The fraction attributable to these infections varies among sites, from 100% of cervix cancers attributable to HPV to a tiny proportion (0.4%) of liver cancers (worldwide) caused by liver \ufb02ukes (Parkin 2006).\nCervical cancer is the third commonest form of cancer globally. Approxi-mately 45% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in Europe die prematurely from this disease. Of several risk factors, HPV infection and subsequent failure to detect precancerous lesions by regular Papanicolau tests are the major cause of this disease. The development of an effective vaccine against HPV offers scope to prevent much of this disease in Europe and elsewhere (Arun 2007).\nInfectious disease interventions Current prevention efforts for hepatic cancer and chronic active hepatitis must focus on universal application of hepatitis B vaccine, given to children at birth, in an appropriate schedule during childhood and to household members of infected persons. Hepatitis B vaccine was the \ufb01rst vaccine to prevent a form of cancer.\nHPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer has been approved for use in the United States for girls prior to onset of sexual activity. Routine vaccination with three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for females 11\u201312 years of age, but the vaccination series can be started in females as young as 9 years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006) and may be used to catch up until the age of 26. Curiously, the vaccine is not recommended for boys even though HPV is sexually transmitted and has been implicated in penile cancer and anal carcinoma in homosexually active men. Despite the potential to prevent a signi\ufb01cant proportion of cervical cancer, there is no plan to reduce the screening regimens for cervical cancer using Papanicolau testing in the United States at least. The approval of the vaccine in Europe allowed it to be incorporated into several national immunization programmes. As of the end of March 2007, Austria, Germany, France and Italy have decided to include the HPV vaccination in their national programmes. Other countries that rec-ommend the use of the vaccine are Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (Arun 2007).\nPrevention of gastric cancer must focus on the clinical management of patients symptomatic with dyspepsia, stomach ulcer or gastritis. H. pylori may infect 50% of adults in developed countries and is a primary cause of gastric cancer. A test (serology for speci\ufb01c IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent Preventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 105 assay) and treat strategy is recommended for patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia who have not undergone endoscopy. Endoscopy is reserved for use in patients with symptoms suggesting ulcer complications or cancer, or those who do not respond to treatment. Treatment involves a multidrug regimen including antibiotics and acid suppressants for 10\u201314 days plus education about avoidance of other ulcer-causing factors (such as smoking, acidic foods, stress) and close follow-up (Meurer and Bower 2002).\nDistal in\ufb02uences on chronic disease risk factors Poverty and social inequalities Poverty and social inequalities may be the most important determinants of poor health worldwide, and poverty itself may also be an independent determinant of many risk factors for chronic disease. For example, tobacco use and alcohol abuse are much more common among persons of lower socioeconomic status.\nHowever, in the well-known Whitehall cohort studies of civil servants in the United Kingdom, con\ufb01rmed by the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) study in the United States, only about one-quarter to one-third of the difference in mortality rates between rich and poor can be explained by differences in risk factors such as smoking, obesity, low physical activity, hypertension and high blood cholesterol (McCally et al. 1998).\nDemographic changes Demographic changes in Europe may have a considerable impact on current and future chronic disease burdens and subsequently on opportunities for prevention (Chapter 2). Primary demographic determinants include populat-ion ageing, reduced fertility, increasing urbanization and continued economic growth. Additionally, in the European region, the overall population is expected to decline over the next decade or so, owing to declines in fertility, unless there is a substantial increase in immigration. This has implications for dependency ratios as populations are also ageing, leading to increased requirements for chronic care resources, additional care needs of the elderly being provided by a dwindling younger population, and increased demands on health systems from chronic diseases.\nGlobalization Globalization is a term with multiple meanings, but generally it encompasses the way nations, businesses and people are more interconnected and inter-dependent across national boundaries through increased economic integration, communication, travel and cultural diffusion (Labonte and Schrecker 2006).\nGlobalization begets ethical concerns, given that there are information asym-metries between populations and that social justice issues arise in the provision 106 T.E. Novotny of services and protection against harms (Novotny et al. 2006). As the spread of infectious diseases across borders has created awareness about some aspects of health security, there is need for sovereign nations to address other global health threats with equal consciousness. These include tobacco use, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and other risk factors for chronic disease that could be addressed through the bene\ufb01cial aspects of globalization (i.e. multinational cooperation and standards, healthy trade policy and international communica-tion systems).\nThe environment Participation in physical activity is not only through sport or organized activity but is in\ufb02uenced by the built, natural and social environments in which people live. Urban design may permit access to environments that can be either an encouragement or a barrier to physical activity and active living. Collective social norms also in\ufb02uence greatly the participation in physical activity. In an analysis of built environment clusters, Nelson et al. (2006) found that aggregate indices of socioeconomic status are not the only issue of importance in explain-ing low levels of physical activity. They also found that race/ethnicity, crime, types of road, street walkability and the presence of recreational facilities were also important factors. There is no single approach that addresses these factors.\nMeaningful combinations of approaches, supported by urban planning theory and empirical evidence on the complexity and origins of neighbourhood, are needed.\nPhysical activity is an essential component of any strategy that aims to address the problems of sedentary living and obesity among children and adults. Active living contributes to individual physical and mental health but also to social cohesion and community well-being. People are more active when they can easily access key facilities such as parks, green spaces, workplaces and shops. Other barriers to active living include fears about crime and road safety, transport emissions and pollution, problems with access and/or a lack of recreational facilities, and negative attitudes to physical activity.\nThe role of the private sector in chronic disease prevention The private sector should be a key partner in chronic disease prevention. For one thing, private employers suffer economically when employees experience pro-longed absences or are limited in job performance by chronic illness (see also Chapter 3). Therefore, there is both a rationale for worksite-based health risk reduction and a larger responsibility for the private sector to contribute to population-based chronic disease prevention. The population from which the private sector derives both employees and customers would be better off with-out preventable disabilities caused by chronic disease. Prevention efforts by com-panies and industries could have a potentially far-reaching effect on consumers and communities (Oxford Health Alliance Newsletter 2006).\nWith respect to environmental design for prevention of ill health, designers, Preventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 107 architects and urban planners can assist in creating an environment in which the healthy choices are the easy choices. Commercial design linked to the common good would make for good business practice and would show concern for public health.\nPrivate\u2013public partnerships, by virtue of their potential global reach, could be formed by a number of different partners from academia, government, the food industry, non-governmental organizations and the pharmaceutical industry.\nSuch alliances might have a profound effect in mobilizing resources, getting the attention of policy makers and \u201cbranding\u201d the prevention approach to chronic diseases. The private sector has the potential to expand the reach of prevention efforts through marketing and promotion; the Oxford Health Alliance (2006) is one current attempt to combine forces among disparate partners in the pursuit of chronic disease prevention.\nThe role of health services and health systems in preventing chronic disease Interventions to combat the increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as the risk factors for these diseases, can occur at the individual, community and societal levels, supported by government policy and health system inter-ventions. In most European nations, the budget for health promotion pro-grammes is less than 1% of the total health budget (European Commission 2000), and yet there is ample evidence for the effectiveness of health promotion and education programmes (European Commission 1990), with many of these interacting with healthcare policies. Although the Disease Control Priorities Project (2007) identi\ufb01ed several chronic disease interventions as cost-effective (see above), governments have, in general, not yet resonated with the need for prevention of chronic diseases on a programmatic level. The reasons for this relatively weak response are manifold.\n\u2022 Many chronic conditions are related to lifestyle, and, consequently, there are residual public sentiments that these result from personal choices and are not under the in\ufb02uence of government.\n\u2022 Prevention programmes need to be multisectoral and so require leadership at all levels of government to ensure policy integration of prevention pro-grammes across various sectors. For this to occur, a broad vision of prevention needs to be adopted by unfamiliar government participants.\n\u2022 Vested interests oppose many government prevention programmes. The tobacco industry is the strongest case in point. With responsibility to its shareholders to sell cigarettes, there is signi\ufb01cant political interference and in\ufb02uence exercised against effective tobacco-control programmes at multiple governmental levels. In addition, fast-food and junk food enterprises often use similar tactics to support free choice by consumers to purchase unhealthy foods. These actions require advocacy groups to alert the public to their exist-ence, support sensible prevention programmes within government and engage prevention within the private sector as well.\n\u2022 It is dif\ufb01cult to assess the effectiveness of individual prevention programmes 108 T.E. Novotny as isolated initiatives. There is an understandable need for accountability in government public health programmes, but prevention is dif\ufb01cult to sep-arate into measurable individual components. Often, a multiplicity of inter-ventions is required to achieve results. Too often, prevention programmes are subjected to short-term, limited and segmented evaluations that may not show signi\ufb01cant results. These programmes need to be evaluated in the con-text of comprehensive approaches involving multiple, integrated channels of action.\nProgrammes to prevent and manage chronic diseases in the United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere emphasize integrated approaches, with clinical care systems being explicitly seen as an integral part of a broader systems approach to addressing chronic disease, involving public health and health promot-ion efforts that are linked to disease management and support for self-care.\nHealth services form a key component of prevention, and various guidelines have been developed to assist health service providers in addressing prevention systematically.\nSpeci\ufb01c preventive activities taken by health service provider systems include screening, counselling, immunization and chemoprevention. Screening is the systematic application of a test to identify individuals at risk of a speci\ufb01c disease.\nThe goal is for people who have or have not sought medical attention to bene\ufb01t from further investigation or direct preventive action. Effectively implemented, medical screening can prevent disability and death and improve quality of life.\nScreening tests are available for some chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and several site-speci\ufb01c cancers (Strong et al. 2005). The num-ber of proven screening procedures for chronic diseases is limited (Chapter 2), although evidence for cost-effectiveness supports the following: screening for elevated risk of cardiovascular disease using an overall risk approach; screening for early detection of breast and cervical cancer where there are suf\ufb01cient resources to provide appropriate treatment; and more targeted screening of per-sons with suggestive symptoms (e.g. screening for H. pylori among persons with dyspepsia).\nIn 2003, the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation published guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention (De Backer et al.\n2003) (Table 5.4). These are geared toward patients with established cardio-vascular disease, asymptomatic individuals with multiple risk factors, indi-viduals with markedly raised levels of single risk factors (elevated blood lipids, blood pressure greater than 180/110 mmHg, diabetes), individuals with close relatives with cardiovascular disease, smokers, and other individuals encountered in routine clinical practice through screening.\nClinicians must develop a therapeutic alliance with the patient to ensure that patients understand the relationship between behaviour, health and disease and can take action with assistance from the health system, whether through behavioural programmes, drug therapy or lifestyle change prescriptions.\nImmunizations are critically important in the practice of prevention. These include the careful monitoring of vaccine schedules and indications (such as hepatitis B and HPV as discussed above). Proactive ascertainment of cervical cancer screening status among eligible women, and prevention of exposure to Preventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 109 Table 5.4 Key elements for prevention of chronic diseases in clinical settings Intervention Screening Counselling Speci\ufb01c interventions Stop smoking Ask if patient smokes Advise to quit, provide behavioural counselling, follow-up Assist with nicotine replacement or buproprion Healthy foods Food history Fat no more than 30% of total calories Omega-3 fatty acids, found in \ufb01sh, low-fat foods, whole grains, fruits and vegetables Physical activity Comprehensive clinical judgement, especially for cardiovascular disease Promote in all age groups; 30 minutes 5 days per week to 60\u201375% of maximum heart rate Overweight Body mass index \u226530 kg/m2 Weight reduction through diet and physical activity Consider chemotherapy and surgery only for morbid obesity Blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg Ensuring adherence to therapy, physical exercise, diet, stop smoking Antihypertensive drug therapy to achieve < 140/90 mmHg Blood lipids Assess total cardiovascular risk Strict diet, physical activity, stopping smoking Statin therapy to lower total cholesterol to < 175 mg/dl, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol to < 100 mg/dl Diabetes Fasting blood glucose > 110 mg/dl, haemoglobin A1c > 6.1% Lifestyle: exercise, diet and blood glucose control Insulin, oral hypoglycaemic drugs Alcohol abuse Drinking history, alcohol-related medical problems or alcohol-related family, legal or employment problems Interventions based on the severity of the alcohol problem and the patient\u2019s readiness to change risk behaviour Non-directive counselling, referral, laboratory testing, family therapy Other prophylaxis?\nThe \u201cpolypill\u201d?\nSource: adapted from De Backer et al. (2003).\nsecond-hand smoke by those sharing households with smokers, may be thought of as analogous to immunization in chronic disease.\nHowever, the realm of health systems in preventing chronic disease goes far beyond the provision of selected clinical services. Clinicians have multiple opportunities for health education and prevention in the of\ufb01ce setting, but they also have wider responsibilities for advocacy and support for policy changes that can prevent disease and disability. For example, each contact a smoker has with the health service provider should be a teaching opportunity and a chan-nel through which cost-effective interventions may be applied. Health profes-sionals can provide sustained messages to all smokers who are exposed to the system, through strict non-smoking policies in health facilities and consistent attention by all health providers to support smoking cessation among all patients who seek care. In addition, parents who bring in children for care should be counselled about the need to quit and, if not able to do so, at least not to smoke in the presence of children.\nHealth systems also have a crucial role in addressing more distal in\ufb02uences on chronic disease, such as social disadvantage, by reducing barriers to and providing incentives for healthier lifestyles; improving access to appropriate, effective preventive health and social services; and participating in population-based approaches to risk factor reduction that address the highest-risk groups (McKee 2002). Clinical preventive services incorporate behavioural, structural and communication functions to reduce risk factors, and in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, the work of primary care teams incorporates risk factor reduction into the health system. Health systems may directly support physical activity programmes in healthcare settings, workplaces, schools and transport systems, and they should participate in partnerships that enhance opportunities for active living.\nSpace does not permit a complete analysis of potential avenues for advocacy through the health system, but physicians and other health providers have been instrumental in advocating for sound food policy, the reduction of trans-fatty acids in commercial food products, the implementation of clean indoor air legislation to prevent exposure to tobacco smoke at the worksite, and improve-ments in school lunches to address the epidemic of childhood obesity. Much more can be done through partnerships at several levels, but governments are crucial in establishing preventive approaches as part of a state\u2019s responsibility.\nFurther, international cooperation among governments is critical in controlling globalized health risks through multinational actions. Food policy, trade policy, advertising policy and information dissemination are all critical multinational approaches. Each nation has a responsibility to work on these issues for the greater global public good.\nConclusions Prevention of chronic diseases is founded on an integrated approach involving government policy, healthcare systems and preventive practice standards, pub-lic information, and individual responsibility for self-care. In the case of tobacco use, substantial evidence is available on effective integrated interventions, but Preventing chronic disease: everybody\u2019s business 111 with obesity, the evidence for population or even clinically based approaches remains limited. With cardiovascular diseases occupying \ufb01rst place in the chronic disease burden, there is ample evidence for a multiple risk factor reduc-tion approach at both the population and individual level. Hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, obesity and physical inactivity require multiple channels of intervention for optimal effect. The healthcare system is critically important in this respect, as those patients with risks but without established cardiovascular disease, as well as those with early or subclinical chronic disease, can be effectively treated. This will reduce future burdens on the health system as well as on the patient. It is clear, however, that prevention is truly \u201ceveryone\u2019s business\u201d, with government, the private sector, the healthcare system and the individual all having substantial responsibilities to apply scienti\ufb01cally based prevention practices to the growing epidemic of chronic diseases.\nReferences Arun, A.K.

The increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions represents a growing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide (Singh 2005). Some health systems have adopted a system-wide approach based on a framework such as the Chronic Care Model (Wagner et al. 2001) (Chapter 4) while others focus on speci\ufb01c elements of care or target people who are inten-sive users of services or at greatest risk of hospitalization (Singh 2005). Given the long-term nature of these conditions, governments and health service providers are engaged in initiatives to develop new ways of supporting people living with chronic conditions to manage their own health. There is increasing recognition that reduced risk and improved outcomes cannot depend solely on the actions of health professionals but are also contingent on the individual\u2019s own actions.\nSupport for people to self-care is, therefore, a vital element of any policy to tackle the rising tide of chronic disease.\nThis chapter will clarify the de\ufb01nitions of terms such as self-care, self-management and self-management support and will detail the theoretical approaches that underpin many self-management support interventions. The nature and effectiveness of self-management support in chronic disease will be analysed critically, highlighting the challenges of providing such support to people with multiple conditions, or who experience social deprivation. This analysis will be illustrated with examples from selected countries. Finally, we will identify health system facilitators that are necessary for the implementa-tion of self-management support. As such, this chapter will be of interest to policy makers and providers engaged in the redesign of services to improve the quality of chronic disease management.\nDe\ufb01ning self-care, self-management and self-management support The concept of self-care features prominently in policy documents in many countries, for example the United Kingdom NHS Plan (Department of Health 2005) and the Danish strategy for the management of chronic conditions (National Board of Health 2005a, 2005b). Similar policy initiatives in Australia refer to self-management (Walker et al. 2003). The concept of self-management support is also used in most countries (Glasgow et al. 2003). There is a lack of clarity and some overlap in the way these terms have been de\ufb01ned and used in current policy and research since the early 1990s (Bentzen et al. 1989; Dean 1989; Haugh et al. 1991; Meetoo and Temple 2003) (Table 6.1).\nSelf-care The WHO de\ufb01nes self-care as, \u201cthe activities individuals, families, and com-munities undertake with the intention of enhancing health, preventing disease, limiting illness, and restoring health\u201d (WHO 1983). The Department of Health (2005) uses a similar but slightly elaborated de\ufb01nition of self-care: \u201cthe actions people take for themselves, their children and their families to stay \ufb01t and main-tain good physical and mental health; meet social and psychological needs; prevent illness or accidents; care for minor ailments and long-term conditions; and maintain health and well-being after an acute illness or discharge from hospital\u201d.\nThese de\ufb01nitions re\ufb02ect the fact that self-care skills and knowledge stem from lay experience and suggest that self-care is a part of daily living. Some def-initions emphasize that self-care involves a partnership between health ser-vice users, their carers and health professionals (NHS Scotland 2005), others suggest self-care activities may exclude healthcare professionals (Eales and Stewart 2001). Self-care can include a broad range of activities ranging from doing nothing in a particular situation (Haugh et al. 1991), or taking painkillers for a headache, to a patient developing expertise in managing a long-term con-dition (NHS Scotland 2005). Self-care may include behaviour and actions taken by those who are healthy, at risk of ill health, experiencing symptoms, diag-nosed with an illness or receiving treatment. Thus, it encompasses speci\ufb01c types of self-care such as self-diagnosis, self-management, self-medication and self-monitoring.\nSelf-management The term self-management was \ufb01rst used by Creer in the mid 1960s to denote the active participation of patients in their treatment (Koch et al. 2004). The aim of self-management is to minimize the impact of chronic disease on physical health status and functioning, and to enable people to cope with the psycho-logical effects of the illness (Lorig and Holman 1993). Self-management is described as a collaborative activity between patient and healthcare practitioner Supporting self-management 117 Table 6.1 Key characteristics of self-care, self-management and self-management support for chronic conditions Who is involved Goals or targets What is involved Self-care Broad spectrum: Ranges from the individual person or patient to families and communities in collaboration with healthcare professionals and healthcare systems; Healthcare professionals need not be involved Optional Prevention of disease and accidents, limitation of illness and restoration of health Improvement in the existing state of health, which may be associated with a chronic condition Changes in lifestyle, maintenance of optimal levels of health Recovery from minor ailments and following discharge from hospital May include doing nothing Taking responsibility for health for self, children, family and helping others Asserting control Managing emotion Goal attainment and behavioural change (Hobbs et al. 1999) Self-management More focused networks Patients, peers, healthcare practitioners and support networks Includes healthcare professional as collaborator with the person with the chronic condition Desirable prerequisite Minimization of the impact of chronic disease on physical health status and functioning; coping with the psychological effect of the illness Minimization of pain; patient participating in decision making about treatment, gaining a sense of control over their lives Initiation or maintenance of access to health services and practitioners Targeting change in behaviour, existing and new Active participation by person/patient Symptom management (Barlow et al.\n2002) Generic versus illness-speci\ufb01c behavioural tasks Individual versus group tasks Medical and role management Self-regulation/self-monitoring Lifestyle change and education Self-management support More focused and complex networks: patients, practitioners and the healthcare system May require a refocus of health practitioner activity Essential prerequisite Service development and chronic disease management improvement, including the provision of self-management support, decision support, delivery system redesign, and clinical information systems Development of new skills in practitioners (e.g. problem solving and goal setting), with the patient as a key resource Patient empowerment, activation and education Increasing self-management skills Cognitive symptom management, positive changes in health behaviour, self-ef\ufb01cacy, health status, and number of hospitalizations Emphasizes collaboration between patient, healthcare practitioner and healthcare system, in standardized, programmatic interventions to improve self-management behaviour Generic programmes, include the Chronic Disease Self Management Program Chronic Care Model; Expert Patient Programme Disease-speci\ufb01c applications are seen in e.g. diabetes and heart failure (Lorig 1993). Self-management activities are usually undertaken by the patient between planned contacts with healthcare practitioners and services. These activities involve managing symptoms, treating the condition, coping with the physical and psychosocial consequences inherent in living with a chronic con-dition and making lifestyle changes (Glasgow et al. 2003). At-home manage-ment tasks and strategies are undertaken with the collaboration and guidance of the individual\u2019s physician and other healthcare providers (Clark et al. 1991). As such, self-management is not regarded as an option but rather as an inevitable series of activities that should be an integral part of primary care (Glasgow et al.\n2003).\nSelf-management support Self-management support involves a patient-centred collaborative approach to care to promote patient activation, education and empowerment (Goldstein 2004). Self-management support expands the role of healthcare professionals from delivering information and traditional patient education to include helping patients build con\ufb01dence and make choices that lead to improved self-management and better outcomes (Coleman and Newton 2005). Self-management support is a key feature of the Chronic Care Model, which emphasizes the centrality of an informed, activated patient to productive patient\u2013provider interactions (Glasgow et al. 2002).\nSelf-management support includes patient education, the collaborative use of a wide range of behavioural-change techniques to foster lifestyle change, the adoption of health-promoting behaviours and skill development across a range of chronic conditions (Farrell et al. 2004). Patients are trained in problem solv-ing, goal setting, and the use of evidence-based standardized interventions in chronic conditions such as diabetes (Coster et al. 2000; Balas et al. 2004), heart failure (Ara 2004), hypertension (Khan et al. 2005) and angina (McGillion et al.\n2004). Collaborative care planning is an important way in which individual providers can support self-management. A collaborative care plan not only focuses on the medical management of the condition but also facilitates role management, negotiation of behaviour change necessitated by the chronic dis-ease, and management of the emotional impact of living with a chronic disease (Fuller et al. 2004).\nSelf-management support may be delivered through standardized, program-matic interventions. Programmes generally target the way the person with the chronic condition thinks or represents his or her illness. They include a range of cognitive\u2013behavioural interventions, with the goals of such programmes directed at self-ef\ufb01cacy beliefs, health behaviour, health status and reducing the number of unplanned hospitalizations (Dongbo et al. 2003). The aim of self-management support programmes is to prepare patients to engage with medical management, to maintain life roles and to manage negative emotions such as fear and depression by offering patients the opportunity to acquire the neces-sary knowledge, skills and con\ufb01dence (self-ef\ufb01cacy) to deal with disease-related problems. In this way they seek to improve the quality of chronic disease management (Goldberg et al. 2003, 2004).\n120 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon The theoretical basis of self-management support Most self-management support provided to people with chronic conditions aims to in\ufb02uence their behaviour in some way. People living with one or more chronic diseases are expected to undertake a variety of activities to manage their condition and may need to modify their behaviour in order to minimize the impact of the illness and to prevent further deterioration. For example, they may need new skills or knowledge to use aids and devices, to manage symptoms and pain, to take medications as directed or to cope with the limitations of their illness. They may be advised to take more regular exercise, control their weight, modify their diet, give up smoking or reduce their alcohol intake. Many self-management support interventions are based on one or more theories of human behaviour. For example, techniques such as motivational interviewing and brief negotiation explicitly claim to draw on theories such as self-perception theory (people are more powerfully in\ufb02uenced by what they hear themselves say than by what others say) and decisional balance theory (decision making can be facilitated by weighing the advantages and disadvantages of a certain issue) (Kaiser Permanente 2005).\nTable 6.2 summarizes some of the key behavioural theories and gives examples of relevant self-management support interventions. These theories are not mutually exclusive and many theories adopted and adapted earlier ideas. They provide different ways of thinking about what motivates behaviour change.\nAn appreciation of the basic ideas behind theories of human behaviour is useful to understand both the appropriateness and the likely effectiveness of self-management support.\nRational choice theory Theories of decision making that derive from utility theories date back to the work of Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) and John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131876), and are used widely in economics and political science. They assume that individuals seek to maximize their welfare when taking action or making decisions. Rational decision making assumes that, when faced with a num-ber of alternatives, people choose an action in line with stable preferences by weighing the expected costs and bene\ufb01ts. In the case of health behaviours, rational choice suggests individuals will only change their behaviour or adopt new behaviours where they perceive that the value of doing so outweighs the costs. If people are not fully informed about the outcomes of a particular behaviour or action, this might present a signi\ufb01cant barrier to effective self-management. Therefore, educational interventions that seek to increase knowl-edge about a person\u2019s condition, available treatment options and preventive and management strategies are an important element of self-management support. Nevertheless, knowledge about the impact of behaviours does not necessarily lead to behaviour change. Strategies such as increasing the costs of risky behaviours, for example by taxing cigarettes, or subsidizing the costs of bene\ufb01cial behaviours, as with vouchers for gym membership, are also used to modify behaviour. Evidence suggests that economic incentives are effective Supporting self-management 121 Table 6.2 Overview of behavioural theories and related self-management support interventions Behavioural theory Underlying concept Related self-management support interventions Key texts Rational choice theory Humans seek to maximize their welfare within constraints and make decisions in line with stable preferences after weighing the expected costs and bene\ufb01ts of an action.\nInformation lea\ufb02ets, educational interventions, \ufb01nancial incentives, patient decision aids Mill and Bentham (1987); Hargreaves et al.

There is less evidence that \ufb01nancial incentives can sustain long-term lifestyle changes (Kane et al. 2004). The rational approach to decision making has been criticized from a number of perspectives: there are limits on our ability to appraise all options rationally (Simon 1957), people use mental shortcuts to make decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1974) and preferences are often unstable and can be shaped by the way in which information is presented (Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006).\nTheory of planned behaviour According to the theory of planned behaviour, behavioural intentions are determined largely by attitude (beliefs and evaluation of the outcomes), sub-jective norms (i.e. perceived social pressure) (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Ajzen and Fishbein 1980). A similar model, referred to as the attitude/social in\ufb02u-ence/self-ef\ufb01cacy (ASE) model, is an extension of the original theory but includes self-ef\ufb01cacy as a third component (De Vries et al. 1988). Interven-tions built on this model focus not only on in\ufb02uencing people\u2019s attitudes to the behaviour and their perception of the outcomes (i.e. is it worth it?) but also on external in\ufb02uences on behaviour (i.e. is this the right or acceptable thing to do?) and whether people are con\ufb01dent to take action (i.e. can I do it?).\nSelf-regulation model An individual\u2019s beliefs about symptoms, the causes and prognosis of the illness and the possibilities for control are known as illness representations. Research since the 1970s has demonstrated the importance of illness representations to patient behaviour (Petrie and Weinman 1997). They have been linked to health-related outcomes such as depression and quality of life (Leventhal et al. 1980, 1984). Situational stimuli (such as symptoms) generate both cognitive and emo-tional representations of the illness; people adopt behaviours to cope with them and then appraise the ef\ufb01cacy of these behaviours. Changing patients\u2019 illness representations has been shown to improve recovery following myocardial infarction (Petrie et al. 2002) and patient outcomes for conditions as diverse as diabetes and the acquired immunode\ufb01ciency syndrome (AIDS) (Petrie and Broadbent 2003).\nTrans-theoretical model of change The trans-theoretical or transactional model focuses on the motivation or intention to change (Prochaska and DiClemente 1983). It identi\ufb01es a series of motivational steps that have to be taken in order to change behaviour: precon-templation, contemplation, action, maintenance and relapse. The \u201cstages of change\u201d theory of human behaviour has been applied widely in health Supporting self-management 123 education and promotion, for example smoking cessation, condom use, weight loss, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and stress management.\nThe stages of change have also been applied to self-management and in this context \u201crefer to a \ufb01xed sequence of psychological and behavioural states that patients move through from lacking the motivation to adopt new self-management behaviours in the beginning to having integrated the new behaviour in their life at the end\u201d (Dijkstra 2005). Researchers have tried to classify people with chronic conditions according to the stages of change. The idea is that patients in different stages bene\ufb01t from different types of self-management support. Such an approach to classifying theoretically derived stages may, however, oversimplify the reality.\nSocial cognitive or social learning theory Bandura\u2019s (1977, 1997) social learning theory postulates that behaviour is in\ufb02uenced by outcome expectations (beliefs about the effectiveness of the behaviour, for example the advantages and disadvantages of an action), obser-vational learning (social in\ufb02uences including social norms, social support or pressure, and the behaviours of others, also called modelling) and self-ef\ufb01cacy expectations (beliefs about the individual\u2019s ability to perform a particular behaviour or to change a speci\ufb01c cognitive state successfully regardless of cir-cumstances or contexts). Improving the self-ef\ufb01cacy beliefs of patients is a key element of many self-management support interventions (Lorig et al. 2001).\nUse of peer modelling (i.e. using other patients as role models) and peer support are approaches grounded in this theory.\nThere is considerable evidence that self-ef\ufb01cacy plays an important role in the likelihood of adopting and maintaining health behaviour changes and is associ-ated with improved affect, heightened motivation, better function, treatment adherence and improved clinical and social outcomes (Marks et al. 2005a, 2005b).\nStress-coping model A chronic illness is seen as a major life event, characterized by a number of recurrent stressful situations that pose serious challenges to adaptation (Moos and Schaeffer 1984; Zautra 1996). People with chronic conditions face a range of stressors. For example, those with diabetes might have to adhere to a complex dietary regimen and perform self-management tasks on a daily basis. Patients with arthritis have to deal with pain, dis\ufb01gurement, loss of functional ability and periods of remission. Their ability to cope with these stressors in\ufb02uences how well they can maintain adequate levels of physical, social and emotional functioning. Interventions based on the stress-coping model emphasize coping strategies and teach patients adaptive coping strategies. Many interventions try to improve coping by enhancing social support and personal coping resources, such as feelings of mastery, self-esteem or self-ef\ufb01cacy. Interventions ranging 124 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon from cognitive\u2013behavioural therapy and psychotherapy to education and support groups are linked with this theory.\nSelf-determination theory Self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan 1985) emphasizes the importance of autonomy. According to this theory, healthcare practitioners must maximize the natural motivation of patients. \u201cMotivation refers to the psychological forces or energies that impel a person towards a speci\ufb01c goal\u201d (Sheldon et al.\n2003). A patient\u2019s motivation to participate in self-management is predicted by the extent to which healthcare practitioners support autonomy and the extent to which an individual feels him- or herself responsible for initiating and maintaining that behaviour.\nSummary of behavioural theories In summary, understanding the theories that underpin human behaviour is important in order to design and assess interventions that support individuals in managing their condition. Self-management usually requires people to adopt new behaviours. The theories reviewed here suggest that interventions to sup-port people in taking action to improve their health and manage their condi-tion require a range of strategies depending on each person\u2019s level of knowledge, his or her illness and health beliefs, his or her attitudes towards the behaviour, the level of con\ufb01dence, strength of social networks and the level of motivation.\nThe support that is needed will vary for people in different social circumstances (as we shall see below), at different stages in their disease and with different skill levels (e.g. literacy). A wide range of interventions have been developed based on these theories, including those that involve the provision of educational support, \ufb01nancial incentives, peer support groups, motivational interviewing, problem solving, goal setting, action planning and strengthening coping skills.\nThe next section will describe these interventions and summarize the evidence for their effectiveness.\nSelf-management support programmes: scope and effectiveness Self-care interventions have been systematically reviewed elsewhere (Coulter and Ellins 2006). Here we provide an overview of self-management support programmes, by which we mean standardized interventions developed for speci\ufb01c target groups (e.g. elderly people, patients with diabetes, parents of children with asthma). As we have seen, self-management requires people with chronic conditions to undertake a variety of demanding tasks. It is, therefore, not surprising that many people with chronic conditions \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to self-manage successfully, and patients may bene\ufb01t from participating in self-management support programmes that aim to develop the attitudes and skills Supporting self-management 125 necessary for successful self-management. Since the early 1990s, there has been a substantial increase in the number of self-management support programmes used internationally, although the approaches vary. Box 6.1 provides selected examples of self-management support programmes.\nBox 6.1 Examples of self-management support programmes Chronic Disease Self-Management Program The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) was developed at Stanford University (Lorig et al. 1999, 2001) and comprises a six-week session of workshops, with weekly sessions of two and a half hours that usually take place in community settings such as senior centres, churches, libraries and hospitals. People with different chronic conditions attend together. Workshops are facilitated by two trained leaders, one or both of whom are non-health professionals with a chronic illness themselves.\nSubjects covered in the workshop include (1) techniques to deal with generic problems of chronic illness such as frustration, fatigue, pain and isolation; (2) appropriate exercise for maintaining and improving strength, \ufb02exibility and endurance; (3) appropriate use of medication; (4) com-municating effectively with family, friends and health professionals; (5) nutrition; and (6) ways to evaluate new treatments. Each participant in the workshop receives a copy of the companion book, Living a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions, and an audio relaxation tape, Time for Healing.\nIt has been claimed that the format in which the programme is taught accounts for its effectiveness. Classes are highly participative, where mutual support and success are used to build up the participants\u2019 con\ufb01dence in their abilities to manage their health and maintain activities. CDSMP does not con\ufb02ict with other interventions or medical treatment of patients. It is designed to enhance regular treatment and disease-speci\ufb01c education. It is especially helpful for patients with multiple chronic conditions and dis-ability, as the programme focuses on the development of skills to coordin-ate the different tasks necessary to manage health and to keep an active life.\nComprehensive Health Enhancement Support System The Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) is an interactive, computer-based system to support people with managing chronic conditions or other health-related crises or concerns (Gustafson et al. 2001). CHESS provides information, referral to service providers, sup-port in making tough decisions and networking with experts and others facing the same concerns. CHESS is designed to improve access to health and human services for people who would otherwise face psychological, social, economic or geographic barriers to receiving services.\n126 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon Target population The majority of self-management support programmes focus on people with a single disease. Barlow et al. (2002) showed that most interventions are designed to address either asthma or diabetes, or more rarely arthritis and heart disease.\nA respiratory rehabilitation programme for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease developed in Canada aimed to support patients to maintain optimal physical, psychosocial and mental functioning levels (Bourbeau et al.\n2003). The programme was shown to reduce the number of admissions to hospitals and visits to the emergency department. It also showed an enhanced use of primary health services and improvement in the patients\u2019 quality of life.\nSome support programmes are not disease speci\ufb01c but generic in design.\nThese generic programmes address the needs of people with multiple comor-bidities or those with chronic disability, often older patients. The Chronic Disease Self Management Program (CDSMP) (Lorig et al. 2001) is probably the best example of such a generic programme (Box 6.1).\nMost support programmes target the person with the chronic condition.\nCarers and family members may accompany the person to one of the sessions but self-management support programmes exclusively designed for carers or family members are rare. Where they do exist, they mainly focus on carers of chronically ill patients who are dependent on intensive home care, for instance those with stroke, dementia or in a terminal phase of their illness. In these programmes, most attention is paid to helping the carer to deal with the emotional aspects of living with and caring for a person in need of inten-sive care. Few are designed speci\ufb01cally to help partners and other family mem-bers to provide positive self-management support to the patient (Clark and Dunbar 2003). The Family Partnership Intervention is an example of a support programme that focuses on developing supportive skills among family members of patients with heart failure (Clark and Dunbar 2003). A major part of this support programme aims to teach family members to use behaviours supportive of autonomy, such as expressing empathy and concern, providing a rationale for self-management, emphasizing the choice a patient has, reducing critical or guilt-provoking language, and helping the patient with problem-solving behaviours. However, further research is needed on the value of support programmes for partners or family members.\nThe system is accessed from a patient\u2019s home via the Internet or soft-ware installed on a personal computer. People participating in the CHESS project who do not have a computer are loaned one for up to a year. CHESS has also been installed in community centres, health centres, college dor-mitories and in the workplace. CHESS is currently being used by several major health organizations in the United States and Canada. CHESS has been successfully trialled with different target groups including the eld-erly, people with low education and people from minority populations.\nPeople have used the facility equally although in different ways.\nSupporting self-management 127 The majority of self-management support programmes target adults; few focus on children. There are exceptions, especially in the \ufb01eld of asthma, where several programmes are designed for both children and adults. Many programmes that are offered to children were originally developed for adults and insuf\ufb01ciently account for the developmental stage of the child (Mokkink et al. 2007). Most support programmes are only used in the country where they have been developed and few have been adapted for use in different countries or cultures.\nAn exception is the Arthritis Self Management Program (ASMP), which was developed at Stanford University but has been delivered in a number of countries outside the United States including Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Nether-lands, Australia and Canada (Barlow et al. 2002). The CDSMP has also been adapted for use in the UK (known as the Expert Patient Programme) and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta; known as Live Better Everyday), and the National Board of Health in Denmark has recommended that it should be implemented nationwide following a successful trial (see accompanying volume).\nContent Lorig and Holman (2003) reported that most interventions address medical or behavioural management tasks, whereas a minority also pay attention to role management and/or emotional management. This, however, depends on the disease process involved: support programmes for patients with cancer are more likely to address the emotional aspects of the disease than programmes for patients with asthma, where correct use of medication comes \ufb01rst. Interventions that focus primarily on medication and symptom management are necessarily disease speci\ufb01c. Interventions that include management of psychological con-sequences (e.g. depressed mood), lifestyle (e.g. exercise), social support and communication are usually generic but can also be designed for individual diseases.\nEarly self-management programmes often lacked a sound theoretical basis or the theoretical principles were not explicit. As noted above, many of the current programmes are based on social learning theory developed by Bandura (1977, 1997) and focus on building self-ef\ufb01cacy or use self-regulation principles. It has been noted that support programmes for patients with diabetes and arthritis are generally more theory based than programmes for patients with asthma, for which interventions are mainly information based and instructional, with only a few incorporating techniques to address barriers to self-management (Newman et al. 2004).\nOther characteristics of self-management programmes Self-management programmes can be group based, developed for the individual or a combination of both. Groups typically have between 6 and 12 participants and often use written materials. Programmes for an individual can range from provision of a manual that participants work through at home to sessions with a health professional on a one-to-one basis in a clinical setting.\n128 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon Most interventions are administered by health professionals such as medical doctors, psychologists and nurses. For example, in Australia, diabetes self-management education is provided largely by specialist nurses and dieticians through diabetes centres. In Sweden, the majority of self-management support for diabetics is given in nurse-led clinics. The CDSMP in the United States and the Expert Patient Programme in the United Kingdom use lay tutors with chronic conditions who are trained to deliver the intervention. An evaluation of Expert Patient Programme found that the perceived success of the group depended on the facilitation skills of the lay leader (National Primary Care Research and Development Centre 2007).\nMost self-management programmes are offered within a clinical setting, such as a hospital or a rehabilitation centre. In some countries, the voluntary sector or patient organizations have traditionally run self-management programmes.\nFor example, in France, diabetes networks have developed patients\u2019 guides and newsletters with instructions on foot care, insulin injections, fat intake reduc-tion and exercise (REVESDIAB). In Canada, the provincial health systems are beginning to take a more active role in investing in self-management support programmes, having previously relied on diabetes and cancer associations.\nIncreasingly self-management support programmes are funded as part of the public health system.\nEffectiveness For policy makers and providers, the main question is whether people with chronic conditions bene\ufb01t from self-management support programmes. The answer is not straightforward. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that most programmes show positive results, but rarely on all outcome indicators that were measured.\nChodosh et al. (2005) carried out a meta-analysis of 53 randomized controlled trials on self-management interventions focusing on elderly patients with dia-betes, hypertension or osteoarthritis and concluded that mostly bene\ufb01cial effects were found on clinical outcomes such as blood glucose level (diabetic patients) and blood pressure (patients with hypertension), but not on outcomes such as pain and functional status (patients with osteoarthritis) and weight (diabetic patients). An explanation suggested by the authors is that programmes that address medication adherence may be particularly effective.\nTwo Cochrane reviews have examined the effectiveness of self-management support programmes. The \ufb01rst concerned self-management programmes for adults with asthma (Gibson et al. 2002). The interventions studied provided self-monitoring of symptoms and regular review by clinicians as well as use of written action plans. The authors found evidence that participation in these programmes had bene\ufb01cial effects on the course of the disease: patients who had joined a self-management support programme had fewer hospital admis-sions and emergency department or unscheduled medical of\ufb01ce visits; they reported fewer night time symptoms and less sickness absence from work or school. The second Cochrane review (Riemsma et al. 2002) focused on the effects of self-management support programmes for patients with rheumatoid Supporting self-management 129 arthritis. The interventions consisted of patient education combined with sev-eral other approaches, such as psychobehavioural methods, exercise, bio-feedback and psychosocial support. There was evidence that the programmes had bene\ufb01cial effects on functional status, the number of affected joints, self-reported health and overall psychological status, but not on the level of pain, anxiety and depression. The positive effects were found shortly after attending the support programmes; long-term bene\ufb01ts could not be established.\nLorig and Holman (2003) described the results of randomized trials con-ducted by the Stanford Patient Education Research Center of their own self-management programmes (e.g. CDSMP, ASMP). In general, they found positive effects on the frequency of behaviours such as exercising and symptom man-agement. In all studies on patients with arthritis and back pain, patients experi-enced a reduction of pain; in most of these studies they also found disability to be reduced. Furthermore, participants reported improved communication with their physicians. In two studies, one with the English version of the ASMP and one with the generic CDSMP, signi\ufb01cant reductions in healthcare utilization were also found. A randomized trial to assess effectiveness of the Expert Patient Programme in the United Kingdom found improvements in self-ef\ufb01cacy and energy levels among patients with chronic conditions, with some evidence of a (small) reduction in associated costs (Kennedy et al. 2007).\nBarlow et al. (2002) conclude from several randomized clinical trials that self-management support programmes are effective in increasing knowledge, symptom management, use of self-management behaviours and self-ef\ufb01cacy, and promote bene\ufb01cial medical outcomes.\nBased on a systematic review, Coulter and Ellins (2006) concluded that edu-cational programmes that teach practical self-management skills appear to be more effective than information-only patient education. Findings from studies evaluating self-management education were mixed, however, as there was a gen-eral association with improvements in knowledge, coping behaviour, adherence, self-ef\ufb01cacy and symptom management. The review found limited evidence for reductions in health service utilization, cost and enhanced quality of life but identi\ufb01ed the following factors as being associated with larger effect sizes: lon-ger and higher intensity interventions, regular review with health professionals, focus on speci\ufb01c rather than general educational topics, participative rather than didactic teaching methods, multicomponent approaches and involvement of informal carer or family members.\nMethodological considerations These studies have a number of limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the follow-up period of the evaluation studies described above is seldom longer than 12 months and mostly shorter than six months, which makes it dif\ufb01cult to draw conclusions about the long-term effects of self-management support programmes. Second, although most support programmes show bene\ufb01cial results, at least in the short term, none of the above-mentioned studies linked speci\ufb01c components of the programmes to outcomes. Most programmes are multicomponent, but the studies often fail to describe interventions in suf\ufb01cient 130 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon detail to allow a thorough understanding of them. This means that we still do not know which approaches, techniques or elements of self-management pro-grammes are most successful and should, therefore, be developed in future.\nLorig and Holman (2003) observed that enhanced self-ef\ufb01cacy is one key mech-anism responsible for improvements in health status among those attending self-management programmes. They concluded that self-ef\ufb01cacy should form a key component in future self-management support programmes. Further research on this question is needed in order to prevent programmes being offered that include unnecessary components and so waste time and money.\nThe comparative effectiveness of generic and disease-speci\ufb01c programmes also needs further evaluation. Clark and Dunbar (2003) contended that support programmes that teach basic problem-solving and self-regulatory skills may be successful for many people irrespective of their speci\ufb01c chronic condition.\nSuch programmes may be promising for people with rare diseases and the many people who have multiple chronic conditions for whom disease-speci\ufb01c support programmes are either not available or are inadequate. Coulter and Ellins (2006) found different results of self-management education with different diseases.\nEducation for people with asthma was found to reduce health service utiliza-tion, with improvements in quality of life and self-ef\ufb01cacy, while education for people with arthritis had only a small and short-term impact on pain and functional disability (Coulter and Ellins 2006).\nOnly a few studies have analysed the cost-effectiveness of programmes (e.g.\nKennedy et al. 2007). Those that have, mostly focused exclusively on the direct costs of the self-management programme, rarely considering the indirect costs to the participant (e.g. time off work or for substitute care, travel expenses etc.).\nIt seems plausible that some interventions will be cheaper than others: peer-led programmes will probably be less expensive than programmes provided by medical personnel, group-based approaches less expensive than providing indi-vidual support, and offering the programme in community buildings less expensive than programmes provided in a clinical setting. These potential dif-ferences in costs have not, however, been systematically assessed.\nResponding to the support needs of different patients Despite the variety of self-management support programmes available, they may not be appropriate for everyone with a chronic condition. Here we identify at least three groups where greater (or different) self-management support may be needed: those with complex needs, those with limited resources and those who are not motivated.\nComplex needs Some groups of patients have particularly complex self-management tasks, such as those with multiple chronic conditions, the frail elderly and patients with severe or various impairments and disabilities (Bayliss et al. 2003; Young 2003; Levine et al. 2006; Suhl and Bonsignore 2006). Such people are usually excluded Supporting self-management 131 from participation in standardized interventions that are evaluated by random-ized clinical trials. Moreover, the existing support programmes \u2013 especially those that are disease speci\ufb01c \u2013 may not be relevant to the speci\ufb01c self-management support needs of patients with multiple comorbidities or chronic disability. Bayliss et al. (2003) reported that patients with multimorbidity often experience \u201ccompeting demands\u201d arising from their chronic conditions. Fur-thermore, engaging in activities to promote physical or psychological health may be hindered by comorbid conditions. For example, a person who is obese and has diabetes and who is advised to exercise may feel constrained from doing so because of coexisting arthritis. Also, depression or other mental disorders, which are concomitant conditions in many chronically ill people (Verhaak et al.\n2005), have been found to impact adversely on self-management performance (e.g. Ciechanowski et al. 2000). Data from the Dutch National Panel of the Chronically Ill and Disabled shows that, in 2005, levels of self-reported inactiv-ity were signi\ufb01cantly higher among patients with severe disability compared with people with no/mild disabilities (Table 6.3) (Rijken et al. 2005).\nTailoring of self-management support is in its infancy and so there is no evidence to guide policy makers as to the best approach. However, some inter-ventions appear promising in this respect. Generic self-management support programmes that focus on the development of self-ef\ufb01cacy and problem solving and how to integrate self-management behaviours in daily life may be effec-tive for patients with multiple morbidities or chronic disability. A disability approach (Heijmans et al. 2004), in which the generic disabilities of people with different chronic diseases in the social, emotional or physical area are taken as a starting point for intervention, may also appeal to patients with complex needs. Computer-based decision support tools have been developed that enable Table 6.3 Level of inactivity among patients with at least one chronic disease by level of physical disability and income, 2005 No.\nInactive (%) Disability None/mild 1102 9 Moderate 450 20 Severe 167 52 Total 1719 Income (\u0001) < 850 139 32 850\u20131450 775 29 1450\u20131900 435 18 1900\u20132300 296 18 2300\u20132700 176 14 2700\u20133300 184 14 >3300 126 8 Total 2131 Source: Data of the National Panel of the Chronically ill and Disabled (NPCG, NIVEL), the Netherlands.\n132 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon telephone-based nursing staff to counsel patients with multiple comorbidities to help them to focus on those self-management activities that evidence sug-gests will be most effective in bringing their condition under control. For example, a patient with diabetes and ischaemic heart disease will have to com-bine activities aimed at lipid lowering and glucose control (Mulley 2006). Other work is needed to establish meta-guidelines and information resources that rec-ognize the interdependencies experienced by people with multiple comorbidi-ties. Most existing information and decision support tools are disease speci\ufb01c.\nFinally, supporting people to manage mental as well as physical conditions will be important. Some providers are considering routine screening for depression and its treatment before embarking on self-management programmes for chronic physical conditions.\nLevine et al. (2006) have warned that frailty \u201cis not just the sum of several disease conditions\u201d: many frail elderly people do not only suffer from multi-ple diseases; cognitive impairments and poor mental health often also coexist.\nThey argued that more research is needed to \ufb01nd out which disease manage-ment approach best meets the needs of the frail elderly. They predicted that approaches which respond to both the social and medical needs of frail elderly people and their caregivers will be most effective.\nLack of resources Some people with chronic conditions may have inadequate access to resources to perform successful self-management or to attend support programmes.\nAlthough self-management support programmes are designed to develop resources such as knowledge, communication skills, effective coping strategies, social support and self-ef\ufb01cacy, a basic level of these resources is needed to be able to bene\ufb01t from self-management support: patients need to be informed about the existence of such programmes; they need to speak the same language as the programme leader and other group members; they need to be suf\ufb01ciently literate to be able to read and understand the accompanying written materials; and they must be able to reach the location and to afford the costs of participa-tion or know how to get reimbursed where relevant. Reaching diverse and dis-advantaged groups has been a challenge for CDSMP courses (National Primary Care Research and Development Centre 2007). Patients tend to be especially disadvantaged if they are older, are less educated, are on low incomes or do not have health insurance, have cognitive or intellectual impairments, or belong to an ethnic minority (Glasgow et al. 1997; Becker et al. 2004; Rothman et al. 2004; Suhl and Bonsignore 2006).\nA 2005 study from the Netherlands of patients with chronic conditions found that those on lower incomes were signi\ufb01cantly more likely to be inactive than those in high-income groups (Table 6.3). Understanding of medication was lower among those with less educational attainment (Table 6.4; Heijmans 2006). Similar examples can be found elsewhere. For instance, Becker et al.\n(2004), in a qualitative study among African-Americans suffering from chronic illness, found that regular exercise was reported less often by respondents who were uninsured. Those who had some form of health insurance had many more Supporting self-management 133 opportunities to discuss their illness and self-management problems with physicians and other health professionals.\nDisadvantaged groups will bene\ufb01t from basic patient education (\u201cwhat to do and why\u201d) before addressing their skills and con\ufb01dence to carry out these self-management tasks (\u201chow to do things\u201d). Individual support from a clini-cian involved in their care could be appropriate, or a group consultation with other patients with the same condition, preferably complemented with written or audiovisual education material in the patient\u2019s native language. In some countries, patients are simply not getting access to basic education about their condition. For example only 28% of people with diabetes in Ontario had access to structured education (see accompanying volume).\nOnce basic patient education and counselling has been provided, ongoing support, involving goal setting and action planning, with regular review and problem solving can help these patients to gain the skills and con\ufb01dence they need to take on self-management tasks. This could either be provided by a health professional from their care team or health coaches accessed by telephone.\nReferral to \ufb01nancially and physically accessible community self-management programmes can be considered once the patient feels con\ufb01dent and motivated to attend a support programme (Coleman and Newton 2005).\nLack of motivation The third group of chronically ill patients who appear not to be served well by existing support programmes are those who lack motivation. Barlow et al.\n(2002) referred to this group as patients who \u201cmay not feel able to embrace the concept of self-management\u201d. Since attendance at self-management support programmes is voluntary, participants must be willing to improve their self-management, or at least to think about it seriously (Dijkstra 2005). Patients who are not motivated to adopt healthy behaviours are unlikely to bene\ufb01t from support programmes that focus on enhancing self-ef\ufb01cacy and formulating per-sonal action plans. These patients generally know \u201cwhat to do\u201d, but not \u201cwhy\u201d.\nIn terms of the trans-theoretical model, these patients \ufb01nd themselves in the precontemplation phase. Barlow et al. (2002) noted that patients \u201cmay need support in making the transition from precontemplation to contemplation of Table 6.4 Knowledge about medication use in 440 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by educational level, 2006 Educational level Mean score (out of 11) Standard deviation No education/primary school 3.3 2.6 Lower vocational 4.1 3.2 Intermediate vocational 4.2 2.9 Higher vocational/university 4.6 3.0 P for trend < 0.05.\nSource: Data of the National Panel of the Chronically ill and Did (NPCG, NIVEL), the Netherlands.\n134 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon making self-management a part of their lives\u201d. The patient activation model, developed and validated in the United States, sees such patients as having the lowest level of knowledge, skills and con\ufb01dence and consequently failing to recognize that they have an active role to play in their health (Hibbard et al.\n2005). By identifying which behaviours are realistic for patients at different stages of activation, it is possible to encourage them to take appropriate \u201cnext steps\u201d suited to their level of knowledge and skill (Hibbard and Tusler 2007).\nUnfortunately, very little is known about how to support patients in making this step. Further research is needed to understand why these patients lack motivation to self-manage and to explore their illness representations, as described earlier in this chapter. When patients consider their condition to be not very serious or do not experience any symptoms, they will feel less motiv-ated to self-manage. Patients may also not believe that they can in\ufb02uence their health or control their disease, either by following medical advice or by self-care. False beliefs about the causes of their illness, its course and consequences, as well as the bene\ufb01ts of adequate self-management may be corrected by inter-ventions that aim to develop autonomous behaviours. This may be by provid-ing information relevant to the patient\u2019s personal goals, use of role models appealing to the patient, monitoring and feedback on progress, or creating peer support through \u201cbuddying\u201d. In addition, healthcare providers may wish to involve partners or other important members of the social network in the self-management process. This can be helpful for all patients but may be essential for patients who lack intrinsic motivation.\nWhile there are many bene\ufb01ts from systematizing the care of people with chronic conditions (Chapter 4), self-management support must be tailored to the needs of the individual. Self-management support interventions need to be developed and evaluated with this in mind. However, further research is needed to understand the barriers to self-management that different patients experience.\nIn summary, proactive teams will make use of standardized assessments of patients\u2019 levels of self-management in different areas, including skills to manage their illness and con\ufb01dence in minimizing barriers to self-management and gaining access to support. We have suggested that the support people will need might depend on the nature and number of their chronic conditions or their level of disability; their education, age, ethnicity, language, culture and income; their skills, knowledge and con\ufb01dence to self-manage; and their beliefs, atti-tudes, readiness to change and motivation. Tools are needed that can be used easily in clinical practice to explore the kinds of self-management problem faced by patients so that appropriate self-management support can be provided.\nBuilding a health system that supports self-management It is only in recent years that healthcare providers and health insurers have recognized how crucial self-management support is to the achievement of bet-ter outcomes. If self-management is critical to good outcomes for patients and there is evidence that interventions can improve patients\u2019 ability to self-manage, what does it take to build a system that supports self-management?\nSupporting self-management 135 Self-management requires a whole system approach. Glasgow et al. (2003) de\ufb01ned self-management support as a \u201cprocess of making and re\ufb01ning multi-level changes in healthcare systems and the community to facilitate self-management\u201d. The healthcare system must give providers incentives to promote self-management (Chapter 9). In a system where providers are rewarded for more activity, they will be keen to see patients frequently, even if this brings little bene\ufb01t to the patient, and even if it disadvantages them given the cost of travel and lost work. Patients can be trained to undertake much routine monitoring, such as blood pressure, blood glucose levels and peak respiratory \ufb02ow. Capitation payments covering at least a year of care or outcome-related payments offer incentives to promote self-management. Financial incentives, in particular clinician rewards, are being used in a number of countries to drive changes in how patients with chronic diseases are supported (e.g. contracts for general practitioners in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and Pay for Performance within Medicare in the United States). Providers must also be given resources to support self-management. For example, in Ontario there is a com-mitment in the Physician\u2019s Service Agreement 2004 that the Ontario Health Ministry will identify and distribute appropriate self-care material to patients enrolled with a Family Health Team (see accompanying volume).\nPhysicians require training in how to support patients most effectively.\nTattersall (2002) contended that many healthcare professionals feel uncomfort-able with the idea of empowering their patients. Active participation of chron-ically ill patients in the management of their disease depends not only on the willingness and ability of the patients but also on positive attitudes and appropriate skills in their healthcare professionals. Support for self-management requires a fundamental shift in the patient\u2013provider relationship. Encounters may require more time, they may be more educational in content and they will demand new skills from health professionals (Chapter 7). In Australia, following a series of 12 demonstration projects, the government is investing AU$515 million (316 million) over \ufb01ve years in self-management. The majority of resources are going into education about self-management for health profes-sionals, in particular general practitioners (see accompanying volume). In France, in contrast, the legal framework makes substitution and delegation of tasks by doctors dif\ufb01cult and does not encourage educational approaches to self-management support.\nDoctors who wish to maintain their professional authority and expect patients to comply with medical advice may undermine other efforts to support patients to self-manage. Endorsement for self-management activities and active referral to self-management programmes by doctors are rare in many countries.\nThe national evaluation of the Expert Patients Programme in the United Kingdom found that professionals had not engaged in the process and few referred people to courses or knew about their content or rationale (National Primary Care Research and Development Centre 2005).\nSelf-management support should not be con\ufb01ned to efforts of individual healthcare providers. Support for self-management requires extensive coordin-ation. This includes scheduling group visits for patients with comparable chro-nic conditions, using disease management guidelines as prompts to structure consultations, providing systematic support by regular phone calls (especially 136 M. Rijken, M. Jones, M. Heijmans and A. Dixon by nurses), and generating feedback or reminders by email or text messaging (short message system; Coleman and Newton 2005). Other changes might include giving patients access to non-physician members of the care team, pro-viding alternative contact methods (e.g. telephone, email or drop-in visits (either individual or group)), giving patients access to electronic medical records, preparing patients for the consultation using agenda-setting tools, engaging patients in their care using goal setting and action planning tools, offering opportunities for peer-to-peer mentorship, and designating a care coordinator or advocate (Bergeson and Dean 2006).Where possible, self-management sup-port also should be accessible via the Internet and call centres. An example of this approach is the Internet-based Australian government initiative \u201cHealthIn-site\u201d, which provides quality information on a range of health topics. Call centres extend this concept. Health First in the Australian Capital Territory pro-vides a comprehensive health website on health and related services, easy access to health information and telephone contact with registered nurses giving health advice 24 hours a day, seven days a week (ACT Government 2007).\nGroup and community interventions such as weight-loss programmes and walking buddies require little direct support from the health system. However, schemes such as \u201cexercise on prescription\u201d, which provide professional endorse-ment or \ufb01nancial subsidies, may increase take up, particularly among patients who are less engaged or from poorer backgrounds. Providers and insurers may need to promote awareness of community resources and their bene\ufb01ts to both the public and clinicians. More-advanced self-management tasks, for example when a patient monitors and reports clinical indicators associated with his or her condition, may require access to telecare and home monitoring devices.\nResults can be recorded automatically in the patient\u2019s electronic medical record and be available to view via a secure Internet connection, so enabling patients to track their progress over time. This requires investment in information technology and assistive technologies (Chapter 8).\nThe Chronic Care Model recognizes that self-management and the active rela-tionship between a patient and the provider are embedded within the health system and the wider social environment. Policy makers should ensure that sys-tems, organizations, individual professionals and the community all facilitate the patient to self-manage successfully.\nConclusions In this chapter, we have focused on self-management as we view this as the most important element of self-care that applies to people with chronic conditions.\nSelf-management requires individuals to take action to change their behaviour.\nMost individuals will need support in order to be successful in this role. In designing and evaluating self-management support, it is important to draw on our understanding of human behaviour. This brief review shows that there is some evidence that self-management support programmes improve out-comes, but more research is needed to understand which components impact on which outcomes and whether improvements are sustained over the long term. Support programmes vary in their design and content. More tailoring of Supporting self-management 137 self-management support is needed to ensure that it meets the needs of different people.\nAlthough self-management support is recognized as an important element of chronic care, few countries seem to be developing or implementing systematic strategies to support this process. Data from a cross-national survey of \u201csicker adults\u201d in \ufb01ve countries in 2004 found that signi\ufb01cantly fewer respondents in the United Kingdom and United States reported that their doctor had given them clear advice on what to do and what symptoms to watch for compared with those in Australia, Canada and New Zealand (Coulter 2006; Davis et al.\n2006). Fewer than two out of three respondents in all of these countries reported that the doctor gave them a plan for managing care at home, with as few as 37% reporting this in Germany (Coulter 2006).

Dixon chapter seven The human resource challenge in chronic care Carl-Ardy Dubois, Debbie Singh and Izzat Jiwani Why are workforce issues important?\nChanging patterns of illness, ageing populations, changing expectations, tech-nological developments and new patterns of practice and funding techniques are all altering the way healthcare is delivered by providers and accessed by service users.\nThe systems most successfully responding to the needs of people with long-term conditions build on continuum-based approaches that proactively iden-tify populations with, or at risk of, chronic conditions and translate these into speci\ufb01c programmes of care tailored to individual needs, while taking a holistic perspective (Kodner 1993; Epstein and Sherwood 1996; Ouwens et al. 2005).\nChanges in staf\ufb01ng and human resources are critical elements of successful chronic care.\nWorkforces in the health, social care and voluntary sectors are under pressure from the increasing demands posed by the epidemic of chronic diseases, yet they are constrained by a lack of capacity and capabilities (Pruitt and Epping-Jordan 2005). In labour-intensive areas such as healthcare, the provision of essential services to people with long-term conditions depends largely on the availability of an appropriately organized and skilled workforce. Integrated sys-tems aim to involve many different professionals working as teams to ensure that the right people get the right type of care at the right time (Norris et al.\n2003; Singh 2005a).\nOther chapters in this book describe how it is important to change approaches to chronic disease management, to support self-care, to use evidence-based approaches and decision support tools, and to \ufb01nance changes appropriately. To achieve these changes, the right people must be in place to provide and manage services. Human resources are thus central to every com-ponent of the emerging models of chronic care.\nMethods Although much attention has been paid to devising new delivery structures for chronic care in recent years, the crucial role of workforce development has sometimes been overlooked. Yet improvements in the quality of health and social services are predicated on both the redesign of organizational systems and a workforce that is prepared and organized to work in these new systems.\nFurthermore, while redesigning chronic care may have signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts for service users, it is less clear how restructuring delivery systems impacts on those providing care. Therefore, this chapter explores the implications for the work-force of new models of chronic care. Drawing on case studies from different countries and published literature, we explore how the changes associated with emerging systems of chronic care delivery impact on the paid workforce, par-ticularly in healthcare. In addition, we discuss how proactive changes to the workforce may be a lever that can be used to improve chronic care.\nThe information on which this chapter is based was derived from systematic review of the literature, sourcing more than 30,000 relevant studies from electronic databases. We also contacted experts in the \ufb01eld and drew on case studies of chronic care in different countries. The review methods and country case studies have been described in other publications (Singh 2005b), including the accompanying volume (Nolte et al. 2008).\nIn this chapter, the term \u201cworkforce\u201d refers to the entire range of practitioners or caregivers relied upon to deliver healthcare, including formal and paid care-givers, informal carers and self-caregivers. The main focus of this chapter is on how nurses, family doctors, hospital specialists, home helpers, social workers, social care practitioners and service managers might be experiencing change at individual, organizational and system levels. However, our analysis also shows that these changes need to be re\ufb02ected in work with service users, their family members and informal carers, who make up an important part of the human resources available in healthcare. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed focus on these aspects of self-care.\nHow does the workforce need to change?\nSince the late 1980s, many countries and regions have developed explicit pol-icies and frameworks to guide the redesign of chronic care and to improve responsiveness to the needs of people with long-term conditions (Sperl-Hillen et al. 2000; Barr et al. 2003; Ministry of Health Planning 2003). Most of the frameworks adopted in developed countries draw, to some extent, on the Chronic Care Model originally developed in the United States (Wagner 1998).\nAs outlined in Chapter 4, delivery system design is one of the six key com-ponents of the Chronic Care Model. Human resources are an important part of such delivery systems.\n144 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani There are at least four distinctive components of new models of chronic care that have signi\ufb01cant implications for human resources: \u2022 increased integration and multidisciplinary approaches \u2022 person-centred care: focusing on service users\u2019 perspectives \u2022 population-based approaches \u2022 focusing on quality improvement.\nThis section discusses why these changing characteristics of chronic disease management models have important implications for the workforce. The next section outlines some of the impacts of these key changes on workforce com-position, roles, skill requirements and practice environments.\nChange 1: increased integration Changing models of chronic disease management impact on integration in rela-tion to individual professionals, teams and organizational structures.\nHistorically, healthcare workforces have been structured to provide services based largely on an acute medical model focused on the treatment of discrete episodes of disease. Within this perspective, care was conceptualized as a dis-crete event occurring in a single location and often involving a single provider (WHO 2002a). Chronic conditions provide a fundamentally different picture because they are permanent, non-reversible conditions that are in essence grad-ual and long term, and that may be expected to require an extended period of supervision, observation and some degree of support across settings and pro-viders (Nodhturft et al. 2000). For example, a person with hypertension diag-nosed with severe stroke may receive acute care in hospital, attend a separate residential facility for rehabilitation and visit a community-based organization or care home for long-term therapy. Furthermore, they may receive practical support from social services and the voluntary sector, and ongoing support from community nurses and their family doctor. They will bene\ufb01t from a diverse array of services provided over a sustained period by different types of provider.\nThere is a large body of evidence to suggest that the most effective care path-ways for people with long-term conditions involve integrated approaches (Wagner et al. 2001; Bodenheimer et al. 2002; McDonald et al. 2002; Neumeyer-Gromen et al. 2004). A key challenge for the workforce involved in chronic care is to manage the transitions of service users between and within services (Challis et al. 1995).\nThe comprehensive and systematic process of assessing, planning, arranging and monitoring numerous services to meet each person\u2019s multiple and complex needs involves some form of individual management and coordination of cases (Kodner 1993). This involves a shift from a task-oriented approach towards integrated provision. This means that workers must possess a broader range of skills and be able to demonstrate a more re\ufb02exive attitude in their work.\nIndividual management does not solely involve formal \u201ccase management\u201d staff. Being able to draw linkages and take a whole systems approach is increas-ingly important for many members of the chronic care workforce, whether or not they have a formal \u201ccase management\u201d role.\nThe human resource challenge in chronic care 145 Case-level coordination is closely intertwined with interprofessional coordin-ation. Because people often have more than one long-term condition, and because chronic illness has many facets, care must be coordinated among differ-ent practitioners. Care is often provided by a team of caregivers from different disciplines with varying skills, knowledge and experience. In terms of workforce development, this moves the focus from single professionals to multiprofes-sionalism and it means that workers need to be able to work in teams and communicate with the other providers who have roles in managing coexisting conditions.\nEffective interprofessional coordination relies, in many respects, on effective interagency coordination. Caring for people with multiple chronic conditions shifts provision from a hospital-centred paradigm to one that values a con-tinuum of care by multiple organizations, including formal health and social care groups and community resources. Enhanced communication between these different groups has the potential to develop more effective referral path-ways, facilitate navigation between services and link practitioners operating at different levels (Von Korff et al. 1997). The chronic care workforce can be instrumental in these processes and has a fundamental role in stimulating and maintaining the partnerships needed between different components of the sys-tem. A key challenge for workers is to accommodate a practice environment where traditional boundaries between organizations or occupational groups are blurred, leading to new forms of working and delivering services.\nThis trend toward increased integration is re\ufb02ected by the creation in some countries of intermediary vertically integrated organizations that are respon-sible for a wide continuum of health services. Box 7.1 provides some examples.\nThe introduction of organizations with responsibility for the planning, man-agement and funding (through direct provision or purchase) of the full con-tinuum of health services for a de\ufb01ned population is linked to several major developments in workforce organization, including a shift from predominantly solo practices towards team-based practices, role expansion for nurses, a search for more \ufb02exibility in using the workforce and the emergence of new channels Box 7.1 Developing integrated organizations In Sweden, chronic care services are organized predominantly in county-owned health centres that are managed with interdisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses and other providers at multiple sites. District nurses with limited prescription rights play a crucial role, as they are responsible for many \ufb01rst contacts with the healthcare system. In many cases, they make a \ufb01rst assessment of service users and direct them to the most appropriate resource (Glenng\u00e5rd 2005).\nIn England, primary care trusts and practice-based commissioning groups aim to bring together local providers of primary and community services under a board representing general practitioners, nurses and other community staff. Primary care trusts are also responsible for commission-ing acute hospital services.\n146 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani of accountability for professionals (Bindman et al. 2001; Gillam and Schamroth 2002). These changes mean that new approaches to chronic care may challenge traditional professional boundaries, conventional team structures and job skills (McKee et al. 2006). There are few empirical studies of the impact of role rede\ufb01nition on the workforce, but the existing evidence suggests that there is a need to consider the feelings and needs of the workforce as a priority.\nFor example, one study of nurses\u2019 education and preparation for working with people with chronic conditions at home suggested that nurses were well informed and adapting to the core values and practices of case management but expressed immense insecurity about changes in their roles (Pratt 2006).\nTraditionally, the clinical roles of medical professionals have been specialized, with little room for delegating tasks to those outside a particular profession. Yet research suggests that many medical professionals, such as doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, spend a large proportion of their time performing tasks that do not necessarily require their particular professional expertise (Richardson et al. 1998). Given the shortage of medical professionals in many countries, the emerging policy focus involves shifting some tasks from more specialized highly skilled professionals to less-quali\ufb01ed, lower-cost workers. This vertical delegation is resulting in blurring of role boundaries and professional values (Brown et al. 2000). For example, in some countries, a social worker may take over some functions of nurses (e.g. counselling) as an integral part of a chronic care team.\nRole overlap can also occur horizontally between disciplines, such as physio-therapists and occupational therapists (Booth and Hewiston 2002). Some sug-gest that role overlap could threaten professional identity (Brown et al. 2000; Booth and Hewiston 2002). However, other research suggests that services such as \u201cintermediate care\u201d do not threaten role boundaries or professional identity (Nancarrow 2004). The key implication is that we need to acknowledge that the workforce is changing and allow for role delegation, \ufb02exibility and appropriate training. Central to this is taking the time to \ufb01nd out what individual workers think, and putting strategies in place to alleviate any fears they may have.\nAnother impact of integration is on education and training. Achieving the kind of \ufb02exibility needed for interdisciplinary working may require profes-sionals to develop new skills. While numerous strategies have been trialled for increasing skills of professionals, including audit and feedback, reminder systems and individual and group education, the overall conclusion is that changing professional skills takes time and effort \u2013 and there is no single strat-egy for success (Munro et al. 2002; Smits et al. 2002; Robertson et al. 2003; Lewin et al. 2004; Jamtvedt et al. 2004). In driving forward change, we must consider ways to acknowledge and modify the attitudes of the workforce, because only by addressing attitudes and values will we be able to encourage the sustainable behavioural changes needed to transform chronic care.\nChange 2: focusing on service users\u2019 perspectives In the paternalistic model that has prevailed in the management of acute illness, the provider is often depicted as the guardian of the service user\u2019s best interests The human resource challenge in chronic care 147 and is given the role of determining the approach to treatment (Szasz and Hollender 1956; Emanuel and Emanuel 1992). However, redesigning models of chronic care requires a new focus to involve service users fully. Service users must engage in their ongoing treatment, make behavioural changes and adjust to the consequences of their conditions on a long-term basis; consequently, service users inevitably become a major caretaker and a crucial part of the human resources or \u201cworkforce\u201d in chronic care.\nAs well as having implications for the role of service users themselves (Chapter 6), this focus on service users\u2019 perspectives also has implications for the paid workforce. New models of chronic disease management shift decision making from paternalistic patient\u2013physician relationships towards an ideal of a deliberative and partnering model that is more responsive to individual needs, embodies a central role for the service user and their families, incorporates their perspectives and preferences in the care process and offers them the educational and psychosocial supports needed for an effective care partnership (Clark et al.\n1995; Laine and Davidoff 1996; Quill and Brody 1996). The role of practitioners thus broadens to include advising service users about recommended approaches to disease management, teaching healthcare skills, providing emotional and psychological support, assisting in access to health and social care resources and promoting healthy behaviours (Stubble\ufb01eld and Mutha 2002).\nThe person-centred approach moves staff away from a provider-driven health and social care system towards a system that incorporates service users\u2019 perspec-tives and focuses on providing tailor-made support to individuals. This applies in primary, secondary and tertiary care. Box 7.2 contains an example of this approach.\nBox 7.2 Changes to provide a person-centred service In Quebec, the \u201cLive well with COPD\u201d programme provides a person-centred approach for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe programme is designed to help people to take more responsibility for their illness and maintain optimal physical, psychosocial and mental functioning. It builds on the capacity of individuals to assess their own needs, determine how and by whom these needs should be met, and adopt behaviours that are likely to in\ufb02uence the course of their disease. As part of this programme, specialized centres run by multidisciplinary teams offer a package of interventions including courses about the disease, its symptoms and management; telephone follow-up; and individual coun-selling. A randomized trial found that the programme helped to reduce hospital admissions and visits to the emergency department and to foster more appropriate use of primary health services (Bourbeau et al. 2003).\nThis is one of many similar examples, backed up by research evidence, of the bene\ufb01ts of seeing service users as an integral part of the chronic care workforce (Lorig et al. 1999; Osman et al. 2002; Bourbeau et al. 2003; Chiang et al. 2004).\n148 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani Change 3: population-based approaches The new generation of chronic care models such as the Expanded Chronic Care Model and the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions frameworks feature an approach to care that departs from a sole focus on disease management for individuals and instead adds a focus on broad determinants of health (Glasgow et al. 2001; WHO 2002a; Barr et al. 2003). These newer models involve building a comprehensive system of coordinated interventions that cuts across the pri-mary, secondary and tertiary levels of care and extends beyond the boundaries of the healthcare system to cover issues such as population health promotion, prevention, screening and early detection, diagnosis, management of diagnosed cases, rehabilitation and palliative care.\nSuch population-based perspectives do not detract from individual needs and are, in fact, complementary to person-centred approaches. A person-centred perspective emphasizes the responsiveness of treatment decisions to the speci\ufb01c needs and preferences of individuals. A population-based approach builds on this to take account of the entire continuum of services and the broad set of interrelated factors (socioeconomic status, housing, physical environment, life-styles) that impact on health.\nThis component of chronic disease management also has implications for the workforce. Population-based approaches move the workforce from caring for a single unit (one person seeking care) towards planning and delivering care to de\ufb01ned populations and ensuring that effective interventions reach all people who need them within a given population. To meet this challenge, practitioners have to assume new roles and demonstrate the ability to manage populations, assess the health needs of wider groups and plan and implement appropriate levels of health and social care interventions.\nThere are also implications for the deployment of workers beyond the trad-itional boundaries of formal health or social care institutions. For example, population-based care may mean that a worker previously located in \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d care must be able to work in community settings or in the social care or voluntary sector environments in order to reach the communities of their de\ufb01ned populations. Such a perspective also implies that the community-based organizations need to be staffed and skilled adequately so as to \ufb01ll the gaps in services that are not provided in formal organizations and to enable them to play a full role in the prevention and management of chronic conditions.\nThe shift towards a population-based approach has motivated the develop-ment of a number of new roles in different countries (Box 7.3).\nChange 4: focusing on quality improvement The increased focus on quality improvement within new models of chronic care also has implications for the workforce. Continuous quality improvement, with a focus on patient safety, is particularly salient in the context of chronic care.\nMedical errors and other lapses in safety are particularly likely to harm people with serious and progressive chronic conditions. Chronically ill people, as The human resource challenge in chronic care 149 Box 7.3 The development of new roles for chronic disease management Community matrons are nurses in England who use population risk assessment strategies to target those with complicated needs or most at risk of hospital admission. Community matrons provide advice, coaching and an extensive range of nursing services and support in community settings and in people\u2019s own homes. This new role is central to the gov-ernment\u2019s policy for supporting people with long-term conditions, with 3000 community matrons to be in post by March 2007. Although com-munity matrons are working in different ways in different areas, there are some commonalities. They tend to be nurses based in primary care and to aim to coordinate primary and secondary care and social services. In large part, community matrons have been recruited from existing pools of pri-mary care nurses, so there has been little shift of skills from secondary care. Most community matrons take part in advanced clinical and case management training offered through universities or private providers.\nNational competency frameworks and training commissioning guidance have been developed. Community matrons use standardized risk assess-ment tools to identify people who may bene\ufb01t from support and to under-take detailed initial and ongoing assessments. Increasingly community matrons are working alongside pharmacists to review medication. The key components of this model are: \u2022 segmentation of people at high risk of admission or frequent service users \u2022 use of clinical information systems to identify people at high risk, simpli\ufb01cation of care pathways (by having one person coordinating other services) \u2022 supporting self-management and individualized care planning, ongoing case management, often for an extended period.\nLocal areas have also been assessing the impacts of community matrons on hospital admissions. Early evidence is mixed. In some areas, com-munity matrons have had little impact on overall admission rates whereas other areas report avoided admissions. Areas where community matrons have most success appear to be those where the role is implemented as one part of a broader chronic disease management programme, working in an integrated way with other services.\nSimilar approaches have occurred in other countries, such as Canada, where incentives have been introduced to encourage family physicians and family practice groups to enlarge the scope of their interventions and to provide a comprehensive package of care to de\ufb01ned populations with chronic conditions. In many cases, this has included more funding for activities related to preventive care, early diagnosis and effective man-agement of people with chronic conditions (College of Family Physicians of Canada 2004).\n150 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani intensive users of healthcare services and medications, have more interactions with the health system and consequently have a greater risk of exposure to potential failures in the system or medical errors (Corcoran 1997; Kohn et al.\n2000). Chronically ill people with poor health status, comorbid conditions and multiple functional and physical limitations may be more severely impacted by errors because they often cannot protect themselves from risks and have fewer reserves with which to overcome adverse effects (Lynn and Schuster 2000). The complexity of care and collaboration required to respond to the needs of the chronically ill also means that there may be more scope for \ufb02awed system designs and consequent errors (Institute of Medicine 2001; Wunderlich and Kohler 2001).\nSafety and quality improvement are embedded in recent efforts to foster optimal management of care for people with chronic conditions and to ensure that these people receive treatment consistent with evidence-based practice.\nYet achieving such objectives depends on an ability to modify the practice environment in which professionals work in order to promote a culture of safety, to encourage open and systematic handling of errors and to reward individual and organizational behaviour directed at quality improvement.\nHistorically, professionals may not have been rewarded for identifying gaps or suggesting improvements. Therefore, this focus on whole systems learning, cre-ating an opportunity to develop and share learning in order to bene\ufb01t both individuals and the wider system, may require signi\ufb01cant shifts in organiza-tional and professional culture \u2013 as well as shifts in individual practice.\nMuch current debate about preparing the workforce to embrace new models of care delivery is focused on the clinical skills and abilities of professionals to engage in new forms of relationships with their clients. Yet while the need to develop new competencies and skills is undoubtedly important, the need to develop organizational competencies is often overlooked. It is important to develop governance and change management capabilities at all levels of the health and social care system in order to implement new models of care.\nFor decades, innovative clinicians and researchers have been developing and testing new ways to care for people with chronic conditions, and there is much evidence about how services can be better organized to improve the quality of care and service users\u2019 experiences (Bodenheimer et al. 2002; Zwar et al. 2006). However, these changes involve signi\ufb01cant organizational and sys-tem improvements and achieving these requires full commitment of the work-force. Motivated personnel are a key tool for facilitating changes in the system and tailoring changes to individual contexts. This underlines the importance of developing a \ufb02exible, innovative and adaptive workforce that will be not only capable of accepting change but also prepared to lead it, manage it and capital-ize on it in their day-to-day practice. The best strategies for encouraging such a transformed and motivated workforce remain uncertain.\nWhat are the impacts on human resources?\nThis outline of the four key ways that new chronic care models necessitate workforce change indicates that major human resource challenges pervade the The human resource challenge in chronic care 151 overall process. Human resources are a crucial link in chronic care policies and need to be addressed adequately if successful implementation of changes in chronic care delivery systems is to be achieved. Yet few studies have devoted attention to the impact on the workforce of new models of organizing and delivering chronic care or to the vast set of workforce changes needed to keep pace with emerging processes of care. In this section, we examine selected policy levers that may help to optimize the workforce\u2019s contribution to chronic care, and the potential impact of these levers on the workforce. The areas considered include conceptualizing a human resource continuum, recon\ufb01guring roles, developing generic competences and recon\ufb01guring the practice environment.\nImpact 1: conceptualizing a human resource continuum Although the number of health and social care occupations has increased in recent years, the formal health and social care system has traditionally recog-nized only a small segment of the potential human resources available. Often informal and lay caregivers and self-care providers have been overlooked. Such a narrow focus is in sharp contrast with the context of chronic care.\nThe needs of people with chronic conditions range from minimal personal assistance to virtually total everyday care. Interventions to meet these needs are offered in a variety of settings (hospitals, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, residential care facilities, family practices, people\u2019s own homes) and extend to a vast range of activities, including health promotion, acute care, rehabilitation and psychosocial support. If the management of services for people with chronic conditions must be person centred, population based and integrated, workforce policies cannot be restricted to formal caregivers. Instead, a broader understanding of human resources is required that takes into consideration the whole spectrum of caregivers, ranging from those who strive to keep themselves healthy to those who look after chronically ill and disabled relatives and those who provide institutionalized or professional services (Pong et al. 1995; WHO 2006). The concept of a human resources continuum is also congruent with the objective of continuity of care, which implies the ability to mobilize a diverse range of caregivers providing services or assistance at different times.\nWhile the workforce involved in providing chronic care can be divided into professionals and paraprofessionals, employees and independent contractors, paid workers and volunteers, and into a myriad of different professional or sectoral groups, it may be more useful to consider personnel in three main categories: formal caregivers, informal caregivers and self-care providers.\nFormal caregivers are workers who are paid to provide their services, including nurses, physicians, social workers, pharmacists, therapists and dieticians. Many of these occupations are subject to legal sanction through licensure, certi\ufb01ca-tion and registration. However, within this formal caregiver category, providers range from highly quali\ufb01ed specialists to workers who have received minimal training. Non-professionals who provide the majority of personal care services, such as assistance with eating or bathing and other forms of support, make a signi\ufb01cant contribution to service delivery and have a major impact on the quality of life of people with long-term conditions. Service providers for public 152 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani and private home care also employ workers who are an important human resource in chronic care. These home-care workers could be health profes-sionals, such as nurses, social workers or personal care workers, or \u201cless trained\u201d support workers. In addition to these direct care providers, the formal caregiver category also includes administrative workers, food service workers and house-keeping staff, who play essential support roles in chronic care. Grouping all these providers into a similar category may help to override professional terri-tories and divisions that do not further the development of high quality sup-port. This will span the boundaries between primary and secondary care and emphasizes that change is important in all contexts and not solely in one sphere of care.\nWhile discussions about chronic care sometimes emphasize the role of formal caregivers, there is evidence that most care provided to people with long-term conditions is delivered by unpaid, informal caregivers, including family mem-bers, neighbours, friends and volunteers from religious and community organ-izations (Wunderlich and Kohler 2001; Hussein and Manthorpe 2005). The sustainability of the formal health and social care system depends to some extent on the contribution of these informal caregivers because, without them, there would not be suf\ufb01cient resources to meet all health and social care needs.\nThe importance of self-care providers is also increasingly recognized (Lorig and Holman 1989; Barlow et al. 1999; Chapter 6). Individual behaviours (diet, exercise, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption) play a key role in the progression of many chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Service users, therefore, have a signi\ufb01cant role to play in managing their own health. A growing body of literature suggests that, with appropriate training and support, most people with conditions such as diabetes, hyperten-sion, asthma and arthritis can perform many tasks that were previously the preserve of formal caregivers in intuitional settings (Pong et al. 1995; Lorig et al. 1999; Astin et al. 2002; Gibson et al. 2003; Coulter and Ellins 2006).\nMany types of treatment and monitoring, such as self-assessment (taking blood pressure, blood glucose monitoring for diabetes), physical therapy for arthritis, self-administration of factor VIII for haemophilia and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, have been delivered safely and effectively by service users themselves (Kobayashi et al. 1990; McDonald et al. 1995).\nIn addition to providing self-care, people with long-term conditions can also provide peer support or act as lay workers to help others with chronic illnesses.\nThere is empirical evidence that lay workers can play a vital role in supporting people with chronic disease or those in need of palliative care (Department of Health 2001; Barlow et al. 2005). There is also growing evidence of the valuable contribution lay workers can play as part of a care team for low-income com-munities (Whitmer et al. 1995; Corkery et al. 1997).\nThere is a lack of information available about whether using lay workers or community workers impacts on the views and responsibilities of professionals.\nIt is conceivable that professionals may feel \u201cchallenged\u201d by informal or self-caregivers or be concerned about the quality of care provided.\nThere is also only a little evidence in the literature on how people with long-term conditions feel about their role as part of the care team. There is evidence that self-management and peer support can be valuable and that people with The human resource challenge in chronic care 153 long-term conditions are sometimes eager to take on these roles (Hainsworth and Barlow 2001; Struthers et al. 2003). However, less is known about how service users view their position in relation to other professionals, or any chal-lenges and barriers that they face.\nRecognizing the critical importance of informal caregivers and self-caregivers raises the question of how they can be supported to optimize their contribution.\nOf particular importance are the knowledge and skills of community members and the tools and support available to individuals to manage their health needs.\nA related question is how formal, informal and self-caregivers can best comple-ment each other. In order to encourage integrated provision of chronic care, more attention needs to be given to coordinating all these formal, informal and unof\ufb01cial resources and promoting communication and collaboration between them. Formal caregivers that are mostly trained to work in institutions will need to develop a broader understanding of health and social care services, familiar-ize themselves with community-based and voluntary services and be prepared to work in a greater variety of settings, including the community sector.\nConceptualizing the workforce as a continuum of human resources has sev-eral implications for workforce policy development. Efforts to improve chronic care would bene\ufb01t from effective mobilization of all sectors in human resources.\nBy looking outside the traditional boundaries and taking account of the entire continuum of resources, the health and social care system can enhance care for chronically ill people, \ufb01ll gaps and avoid duplication.\nFinally, while shortages in the formal health workforce have attracted the attention of policy makers and planners, any sustainable framework for chronic care needs to consider the socioeconomic changes that are likely to pose a threat to the informal caregiving workforce. Changes in family structure, increases in the contribution of women to the labour force and an increasingly unfavour-able dependency ratio created by declining birth rates and longer lifespan are among the factors that could limit the availability of informal care in the future (Brodsky et al. 2000; WHO 2002b).\nImpact 2: recon\ufb01guring roles WHO has documented the global shortage of human resources in health, in particular physicians and nurses. While this shortage is more evident in poorer countries, developed countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States are also experiencing shortages. This shortage of human resources impacts on how long-term conditions can be managed (Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee 2005; Productivity Commission 2005). One study found that 3.5 hours out of every family physician\u2019s day was spent managing people with the 10 leading chronic illnesses, even assuming the conditions were stable and under control. The estimated time required was multiplied three times for uncontrolled chronic diseases (Ostbye et al. 2005). A range of strategies have been developed to respond to the limited availability of staff, including recon-\ufb01guring roles. This process of recon\ufb01guration can be grouped into two domin-ant patterns: rede\ufb01ning existing roles and creating new types of provider.\n154 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani Rede\ufb01ning existing roles Governments and professional governing bodies specify the scope of practice for most clinical professionals. Sometimes regulatory boundaries may act as obstacles to positive change, innovation and effective use of professionals. In France, each health professional\u2019s role is de\ufb01ned by law enacted by Parliament.\nIn the Netherlands, a regulatory body (the MOBG) is in charge of the quali\ufb01ca-tions for (new) disciplines and educational programmes. Professional interest groups may also try to protect their position by in\ufb02uencing outcomes and decisions related to disciplines.\nHowever, rede\ufb01ning roles, or the scope of practice in particular roles, is a strategy that can be used to make better use of an increasingly diversi\ufb01ed work-force and ensure adequate supplies of the right type and mix of workers. These changes in professional boundaries fall into four categories: enhancement, sub-stitution, delegation and innovation (Sibbald et al. 2004; McKee et al. 2006).\nNurses have been particularly targeted by these changes. A number of coun-tries have provided nurses with opportunities to work in a much wider range of clinical roles and to assume functions previously restricted to physicians (Frich 2003; Loveman et al. 2003). The most commonly researched strategies for expanding the role of nurses include support from specialist nurses in primary or secondary care, nurse-led clinics in primary or secondary care and nurse-led outpatient follow-up by primary or secondary care nurses (Singh 2005a). For example, in the United Kingdom, nurses specializing in helping people with a particular type of condition (such as diabetes nurses or asthma nurses) substi-tute for general practitioners in routine appointments, running clinics to moni-tor and inform patients or undertaking outreach and educational work to increase the skills of other health and social care professionals (Grif\ufb01ths et al.\n2004). In Scandinavia, nurse anaesthetists have an important role in assessing chronic pain and managing postoperative pain (Moote 1993; Stromberg et al.\n2001). Box 7.4 contains another example, from Canada.\nA growing body of evidence suggests that these processes of rede\ufb01nition can Box 7.4 Primary care networks in Canada With funding from the federal government, many primary care networks (PCN) in the Capital Health region of Edmonton, Canada have hired allied health professionals. The composition of allied health professionals varies with the needs of the particular region and may include such pro-fessionals as nurse practitioners, dieticians, mental health navigators, pharmacists and occupational therapists. Physicians in many PCNs work on a core set of practices and transfer some clinical roles to allied health professionals who can cover that area of practice. For example, an allied health professional may work with a person with diabetes to provide education, care planning, follow-up care and checking that foot and eye examinations and referrals have been provided. All allied health profes-sionals receive necessary training to upgrade their skills.\nThe human resource challenge in chronic care 155 improve outcomes for service users. Several systematic reviews have found that primary care nurses with expanded roles can provide care equivalent to that traditionally provided by family doctors, with the caveat that most studies reviewed included small numbers of clinicians and few examined long-term outcomes (Brown and Grimes 1995; Horrocks et al. 2002). There is good evi-dence that nurses who specialize in a particular long-term condition, either in hospital or in the community, can help to improve the health of patients and reduce their use of health services (Grif\ufb01ths et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2004; Singh 2005b). Clinics run by specialist nurses have also been associated with improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes (Vrijhoef et al. 2000; Connor et al.\n2002; Stromberg et al. 2003; Singh 2005a). Box 7.5 provides an example from Sweden (see also Chapter 4).\nThis process of role expansion is not con\ufb01ned to nurses. Changes associated with chronic care have also created opportunities for many other groups, such as pharmacists and social workers, to assume new roles in care delivery.\nFor instance, a new pharmacists\u2019 contract adopted in England and Wales in 2004 gave pharmacists opportunities to expand their role into chronic disease management by providing repeat prescriptions, reviewing medication and compliance and providing smoking cessation services. However, few studies have investigated what these changes mean for professionals themselves \u2013 either the professionals with rede\ufb01ned roles or the colleagues working alongside them.\nThere is a further challenge in that alongside the move towards greater \ufb02exi-bility in roles is an equal and opposite pressure towards specialization, as re\ufb02ected in the organization of integrated care pathways around diagnostic groups. The stated justi\ufb01cation is that people with specialized skills may provide better treatment than generalists. Yet, while specialized services may increase the coherence of care for some types of service user, it presents a major challenge for managing the larger volume of demands in chronic care because so many Box 7.5 Rede\ufb01nition of the role of nurses in Sweden Sweden is one of the leading countries in Europe in the area of nurse-led patient education and follow-up. Between 1990 and 1998, nurse-led heart failure clinics opened in two-thirds of all Swedish hospitals (Stromberg et al. 2001). Follow-up at these clinics with education, optimized treat-ment and social support has been found to improve survival and self-care behaviour and to reduce the need for hospital care (Cline 2002; Stromberg et al. 2003). However, these changes in the scope of practice are part of an overall process of reorganizing care delivery. They are not simply about substituting one staff group for another. While there is evidence to sup-port this way of working, there are also studies suggesting that increased use of less-quali\ufb01ed staff is not effective in all situations, so caution is necessary to ensure that these changes re\ufb02ect patient needs rather than short-term cost-reduction strategies.\n156 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani people (particularly the elderly) have multiple conditions. Many people with multiple diagnoses will not easily \ufb01t into the integrated pathways set up around speci\ufb01c diagnoses and could be better served by generalists. This tension between specialization and generalists is an area in need of further exploration when developing and implementing new chronic care services.\nCreating new types of provider Diversi\ufb01cation differs from merely rede\ufb01ning existing roles because it calls for the development of providers with new skill sets. Traditional professional roles do not necessarily \ufb01t the requirements of people with chronic conditions.\nTherefore, the \ufb01eld of chronic care has been a site of experimentation for a range of new types of care provider. Liaison nurses have been created in a number of countries to support activities such as post-hospital discharge follow-up, pul-monary rehabilitation for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, supervision of medication and compliance, patient education and service navi-gation. As part of chronic care initiatives, case managers have been introduced in many jurisdictions as a way of a way of coordinating services for people with long-term conditions or complex social and medical needs. Such case managers assume a range of functions, including assessing people\u2019s needs, developing care plans, helping people to access appropriate care, monitoring the quality of care and maintaining contact with the person and their family.\nEarlier legislation has sometimes focused on exclusive areas of practice for individual disciplines. New initiatives to recon\ufb01gure the workforce are building on new types of worker, who have multiple competencies or skills and who are trained to perform procedures and functions that overlap several disciplines. For example, in 2005, the Department of Health in England consulted about the possibility of a medical care practitioner, or physician\u2019s assistant, de\ufb01ned as a new healthcare professional who, while not a doctor, would work within the medical model, with the attitudes, skills and knowledge base to deliver holistic care and treatment within the general medical and/or general practice team.\nIn chronic care, there is an opportunity to promote generic professionals with a de\ufb01ned range of allied skills (nursing, physiotherapy, limited prescribing) working closely with other members of health and social care teams (Brooks 2003). The use of new technologies, such as telemedicine, also calls for more \ufb02exibility in roles and potentially more roles involving multiple skills (Piette et al. 1999; Montani et al. 2001; Montori et al. 2004).\nTo date, the quality of care provided by multi-skilled workers has not been researched extensively or systematically. Nor has the impact of such changes been assessed on practitioners themselves. Even assuming that \u201cmulti-skilling\u201d is compatible with other models of care, there are a number of implementation issues that need to be addressed. Various impediments have been identi\ufb01ed, such as resistance and fear of encroachment by practitioners in affected discip-lines, practice restrictions arising from licensure and liability implications.\nOf particular importance are debates about the risk of \u201cdeprofessionaliza-tion\u201d. Despite evidence that nurses achieve as good health outcomes as doctors in some circumstances, and that patient satisfaction with nurse-led care is generally high (Kinnersley et al. 2000; Horrocks et al. 2002), some physicians are The human resource challenge in chronic care 157 reluctant to delegate or devolve their traditional responsibilities to nurses or other professionals as they see this as \u201cdeprofessionalization\u201d or \u201cdeskilling\u201d their profession.\nResearch in Canada found that fee-for-service physicians thought that col-laborating with nurse practitioners was time consuming and perceived this as deskilling their profession (Centre for Nursing Studies and Institute for the Advancement of Public Policy 2001). One collaborative project ended when doctors refused to work with nurse practitioners. In this instance, the medical society and doctors who opposed the nurse practitioner programme said nurse practitioner duties intruded on the traditional role of the physicians (Canadian Health Services Research Foundation 2001). Similarly, in British Columbia, physicians surveyed felt they would be in competition with nurse practitioners (Schreiber et al. 2003).\nAnother type of \u201cdeskilling\u201d is sometimes thought to occur as a result of striving for economic ef\ufb01ciency. In this context, deskilling refers to using fewer trained personnel to provide care (Baumann and Silverman 1998) or using non-regulated healthcare workers to do skilled professional jobs (WHO 2002c; Enhancing Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Primary Healthcare Initiative 2005). Using unquali\ufb01ed staff to replace quali\ufb01ed nurses became common in the 1990s, particularly in North America, for cost-containment purposes. In areas such as long-term care, unquali\ufb01ed nurse aides, assistants or support workers often carry out tasks previously completed by quali\ufb01ed medical work-ers, such as nurses. Sometimes nurses in this situation feel their skills are being devalued (Edwards 1997). Others have argued that unquali\ufb01ed workers add to indirect costs through skill dilution, absenteeism and high rates of turnover (Orne et al. 1998). There is con\ufb02icting evidence about the impact of greater numbers of quali\ufb01ed staff on the quality of care and ef\ufb01ciency (owing to reduced absenteeism or error) in the management of chronic disorders (Sibbald et al. 2004), although there is now clear evidence that lower numbers of registered nurses impacts adversely on quality of care in the acute sector (Aiken et al. 2002).\nImpact 3: developing generic competencies New strategies for chronic disease management signal a changing emphasis in user\u2013provider relationships and in the settings where services are provided, the types of carer involved and the focus on change management. Such changes necessitate a new set of staff competences to sustain these shifts. Although exist-ing competencies remain essential, the transition from acute to chronic health problems places a new set of demands on the health and social care workforce.\nIn addition to skills that facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of acute illness and injury, new models for chronic disease management require the workforce to have an additional set of core competencies.\nWHO suggests that core generic skills for delivering care to people with long-term conditions include skills and knowledge that transcend the boundar-ies of speci\ufb01c disciplines and are necessary for all professionals (WHO 2005).\nThe following are seen as important.\n158 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani \u2022 Delivering patient-centred care requires all workers to acquire communica-tion skills, see things from the perspective of service users, provide education and information, involve service users in all aspects of decision making and motivate and train people in self-management.\n\u2022 Managing the diverse transitions in chronic care means that the workforce must be capable of creating and maintaining effective partnerships with all caregivers who operate at different levels of the system: patients and their relatives, informal providers and other formal providers and the community.\nOf critical importance is the ability to collaborate with others and work in a variety of settings. Communication skills are necessary to negotiate, share decisions and collectively solve problems. The ability to use information technology is essential to support care, monitor people\u2019s navigation across different settings at different time points, exchange information with other providers and monitor response to treatments.\n\u2022 Chronic care initiatives involve signi\ufb01cant organizational and system changes to establish new ways of working and delivering care. Implementation of these changes requires a workforce skilled at managing the change process.\n\u2022 Ensuring patient safety means that workers must possess basic knowledge about quality management and be able to make use of measurement and improvement tools in their practice. Clinicians need to be skilled at accessing the current knowledge base, gathering evidence about the best standards of care and integrating them into their practice. There is some evidence that identifying good practice and evaluating the success of services are gaps in the current competencies of many service managers and providers (Ham et al. 2007).\n\u2022 Population-based care requires the workforce to engage in health promotion and prevention activities and to provide treatment and services across the entire continuum of care. This broadening of functions will likely require the development of public health capabilities, including reinforcing staffs mem-bers\u2019 understanding of their responsibility to broader populations as well as individuals.\nImplications for training Complementing the technical competencies of workers with this new core set of generic competencies has several implications for educational programmes.\nAlthough there is not a single educational model that would foster improved chronic care, existing approaches are \ufb02awed in a number of ways.\nRecently, several promising didactic and experiential interdisciplinary initia-tives have been set up in Canada to build a workforce that is multicompetent and skilled in working effectively in teams (Health Council of Canada 2005).\nThe Interprofessional Education for Collaborative Patient-Centred Practice Ini-tiative (IECPCP), led by Health Canada, aims to promote and demonstrate the bene\ufb01ts of interprofessional education in a wide range of settings and types of care delivery. Toronto Rehabilitation, a specialized teaching hospital, has initi-ated a new approach to clinical placements in rehabilitation and complex con-tinuing care. Students are given an opportunity to see interprofessional care in action and to understand the roles of other professions. For eight weeks, a team The human resource challenge in chronic care 159 of students from several faculties (medicine, nursing, social work and rehabilita-tion sciences) are placed with a clinical service that has demonstrated exceptional teamwork under the supervision of an interprofessional education leader. Such collaborative training is increasingly recognized as key in sharing responsibilities for patient care and making healthcare delivery more responsive to population health needs.\nTwo universities in Canada have established interprofessional programmes for health sciences education. At Memorial University of Newfoundland, the Centre for Collaborative Health Professional Education brings together \ufb01ve disciplines (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work and education) to deliver and evalu-ate interprofessional education for future health professionals. Similarly, the College of Health Disciplines at the University of British Columbia leads 15 health and human service programmes in interprofessional education and research. The task is summarized as follows (Pruitt and Epping-Jordan 2005): Common approaches to care are needed across different chronic condi-tions. Patients do better if they receive effective treatment within an inte-grated system, with multidisciplinary teams, support for self-management and regular follow-up. Enabling this requires a paradigm shift from a med-ical, curative model of healthcare towards a coordinated, comprehensive system . . . Healthcare teams need to be organized to coordinate care across providers and settings. Equipping physicians, nurses and other profes-sionals with the necessary training and skills has implications for under-graduate curricula, specialist training and continuing education.\nSome have argued that education programmes in health systems using the Chronic Care Model or similar need to encompass all aspects of the model, so that information technology, self-management support and teamwork are as important as clinical or managerial skills. Munro et al. (2002) commented: \u201cWhat should medical schools be doing? For a start, they should create ambula-tory care programs, such as the Chronic Care Model \u2013 which includes a practice team, information system, decision supports for practice, and patient self-management supports \u2013 to be the sites for new types of learning.\u201d Training for managers is just as important as training for practitioners. When thinking about revising training programmes, it may be important to build in time to raise awareness among health and social care practitioners and man-agers about both substantive content and new ways of working, including: \u2022 substantive content \u2013 the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of long-term conditions \u2013 the psychological and social aspects of living with long-term conditions \u2022 patient-centred care \u2013 the role of service users and carers, including how to support self-management \u2013 the needs of caregivers \u2013 how to work in different locations, including homes and community facilities \u2022 team work \u2013 the roles of different professionals and service providers 160 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani \u2013 relationship building and listening skills \u2013 teamwork and shared care, including how to work across organizations and specialities \u2022 using technology \u2013 how to support service users by telephone, email, or video links \u2013 using integrated medical records to store and share information \u2022 quality improvement \u2013 risk strati\ufb01cation and taking a public health perspective \u2013 project management, quality assessment and data analysis skills.\nIt is necessary, however, to sound a note of caution. Overall, the evidence avail-able suggests that existing approaches to continuing professional development do not always improve skills or change behaviours (Oxman et al. 1995; Bero et al. 1998). It is, therefore, important that these skills are built into standard medical and management training, not solely as an \u201cadd on\u201d after practitioners or managers are in post. Regular updating of skills, including how to work effect-ively across organizational structures and how to support self-care, should supplement this focus on enhanced generic competencies as part of routine training.\nAnother issue of concern is that training of health workers is still mostly con\ufb01ned to institutional settings. Yet, with new models of chronic care, more services are shifting to community-based settings. Educational programmes may, therefore, need to extend beyond the walls of teaching hospitals in order to give medical trainees educational experience that provides them with a broader understanding of healthcare issues, familiarizing them with community-based care and preparing them to work in a variety of settings.\nA closely related issue is the lack of emphasis on primary healthcare. Many of the needs of people with chronic disease relate to primary care and require skills that are not acquired in current training programmes that focus on inpatient care (WHO 2002a, 2005; Institute of Medicine 2003, 2004). Preparing the work-force for the challenges of chronic care requires a shift from a curative orienta-tion of healthcare education towards a more balanced curriculum that addresses health promotion functions and socio-psychological aspects of healthcare deliv-ery as well as providing treatment and supporting services.\nIt is clear that changes to the conceptualization and roles of the chronic care workforce necessitate changes in how people are trained. Policy attention is most often focused on the competencies of formal caregivers. Yet, as pointed out above, informal caregivers and self-care providers are equally important. If they are to make an active contribution to delivery of chronic care, they must be given the opportunity to enhance their caring capabilities. Interventions to improve health literacy have proven to be of particular importance in improv-ing the abilities of service users to read and understand health information, calculate the timing and dose of medication, evaluate and make decisions about treatment options and engage actively in the management of their conditions (Wake\ufb01eld 2004).\nThe human resource challenge in chronic care 161 Impact 4: recon\ufb01guring the practice environment The implementation of changes to service delivery depends not only on the composition of the workforce and practitioners\u2019 skills and roles but also on creating a practice environment that is likely to retain current workers and ensure each practitioner is able to contribute fully. Three key policy levers may be used by decision makers to improve the practice environment and sustain changes in chronic care: organizational arrangements, technology and organ-izational culture.\nOrganizational arrangements Organizational arrangements refer to formal structures, administrative policies and rewards, including wages and bene\ufb01ts, non-\ufb01nancial incentives and career development opportunities. The challenge is to ensure that supportive systems are developed to foster the changes initiated.\nTraditional arrangements for providing health and social services have focused largely on the individual practitioner. In the chronic care environment, many people require a complex array of services, which, in turn, are dependent on the knowledge and competencies of a multi-skilled team. Numerous studies have linked this multidisciplinary team model with care processes, clinical out-comes and service use that are superior to those achieved by traditional care arrangements, with many of these studies evaluating the addition of nurses, social workers, psychologists and clinical pharmacists to teams (Halstead 1976; Wells et al. 2000). For instance, in general practices in England, improved teamwork is associated with better processes of care, continuity of care, access to care and satisfaction (Campbell et al. 2001; Stevenson et al. 2001). However, the extent to which practitioners can work in teams depends on prevailing organizational arrangements.\nThe way resources are allocated and the systems for paying providers have long been identi\ufb01ed as bottlenecks that may compromise the effective delivery of chronic care and that play a major role in whether healthcare providers embrace or resist changes in the mix of skills and responsibilities. Payment mechanisms that are based on individual reward (such as fee for service) and focus on face-to-face visits or speci\ufb01c procedures discourage team-based prac-tices and do not account for many aspects of chronic care, including record keeping and of\ufb01ce work, travel time, counselling and communication with other team members and professionals. Practice settings where teams are funded, rather than individual providers, appear to generate a workforce more willing to organize care to best suit the needs of the populations they serve and to optimize the skill mix of their staff. To remove \ufb01nancial disincentives to interprofessional practice, \ufb02exible compensation schemes such as capitation and full or partial salary have been used in many countries (Box 7.6; see also Chapter 9).\nIn transforming chronic care, it is important to consider the impacts of the organizational arrangements upon staff and to think about incentives to encourage change. Gaps in clinical support systems, unreasonable administra-tive burdens for clinicians and limitations in information systems are all 162 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani examples of organizational problems that can create barriers to developing more ef\ufb01cient and effective approaches to chronic care. All of these factors impact on the workforce and the extent to which team members are able to adapt to service delivery changes. For instance, a lack of resources may be a key barrier for physicians to work in a multidisciplinary team environment. In one study, general practitioners identi\ufb01ed the main barriers as time, organization, communication, education and resources (Blakeman et al. 2001). Providing adequate resources can act as a catalyst to encourage general practitioners and others to join or expand teams.\nTechnology Another key lever is technology. Technology is not restricted to machines and devices but encompasses a wide range of tools such as job and role design, clinical protocols and information systems. In chronic care, information tech-nologies provide a powerful tool to facilitate transfer of information, eliminate redundant paperwork and monitor progress (Biermann et al. 2000; Kruger et al.\n2003). Decision-support and clinical information systems, such as computer systems that provide prompt feedback on performance, can improve health professionals\u2019 adherence to guidelines for a range of chronic diseases (Zwar et al.\n2006; Chapter 8).\nImplementation of electronic health records has often proved dif\ufb01cult.\nBox 7.6 Different payment models In Canada, blended models of payment instituted through use of the intergovernmental Primary Healthcare Transition Fund have provided the opportunity and incentive to increase the time that various members of healthcare teams spend on health promotion, disease prevention and management of chronic diseases. In Ontario and Quebec, family practice physicians have been encouraged to shift to group practice structures through a variety of alternative payment schemes that reward the achievement of targets for health promotion and disease prevention or the use of certain procedures in chronic disease management.\nIn England, the general practitioner contract does not directly threaten the income of general practitioners if other skill groups are used. This allows use of nurses rather than doctors to provide services such as immunization, cervical screening and health promotion. In addition, the Quality Improvement and Outcomes Framework provides incentives through a system of points for general practitioners who use best practices to work with people with long-term conditions.\nIn Australia, incentives for care planning and case conferencing for people with chronic disease and complex care needs were introduced in the 1999 EPC package. To qualify for a Medicare bene\ufb01t, a care plan must involve at least two care providers other than the general practitioner.\nThe human resource challenge in chronic care 163 However, the burgeoning volume of clinical information confronting providers of chronic care makes technology an essential tool to facilitate communication between team members and to prevent errors. Robotics, monitoring technolo-gies and telecommunications devices are other examples of tools that have many potential applications in chronic care and could improve both service delivery and the conditions of workers\u2019 practice. However, workers may need training and support to adopt new technologies, as well as the time and capacity to reap the rewards.\nOrganizational culture A less tangible but no less important, lever in improving chronic care is pro-fessional and organizational culture (Stott and Walker 1965). This includes organizational philosophy and values, management styles and the patterns of behaviour and attitudes among an organization\u2019s members. Working in an interdisciplinary team environment means that professionals have to negotiate their own value system with those of other professionals while they also deal with the overriding organizational culture. Even if there are shared values, pro-fessionals may assume that they hold substantially different values and prac-tices to others, and these perceptions may in\ufb02uence relationships with other professionals and organizations.\nThe magnitude of change involved in transforming chronic care means that the process cannot be approached as a one-off event or a discrete organizational intervention. Rather, changing chronic care is a long evolutionary process that necessitates forging a shared vision about what the system should be, identifying the direction in which the efforts should be focused and implementing strategic actions to deliver this vision. Such evolving and complex change may pro\ufb01t from building an organizational culture deliberately orientated towards innov-ation, negotiation, experimentation, critical appraisal and continuous learning.\nThis too has implications for the workforce: people must be given the time, skills and scope for innovation, and perhaps be rewarded for making change.\nConclusions This chapter has outlined why workforce issues are central to the development and implementation of new ways to manage chronic care. New models of con-ceptualizing and delivering chronic care involve at least four factors that herald the need for signi\ufb01cant workforce changes: integration at an individual, team and organizational level; person-centred care; population-based focus; and increased focus on quality improvement.\nImproving chronic care offers many clinical and quality bene\ufb01ts for service users, but it also impacts on staff. These impacts, while positive in the longer term, may be seen as challenges in the short term. Investing in staff, in terms of time, training and resources, will be crucial to the success of any system or programme-level changes in chronic care.\nYet, the country case studies reviewed for this chapter (Nolte et al. 2008) suggest that, while some targeted work is being undertaken to develop new staff 164 C.-A. Dubois, D. Singh and I. Jiwani roles and competency frameworks, less thought may have been put into tack-ling the more complex aspects of workforce and organizational development.\nJust how can we ensure that health and social care staff work together? What will motivate a hospital consultant to point out potential gaps in the system?\nWhat needs to happen to ensure a nurse is motivated to take on and develop the ideas of service managers and planners in day-to-day practice? We do not yet know the answers to these types of question \u2013 but we need to think about the answers if we are serious about transforming chronic care.\nWe know that audit and feedback, practitioner education sessions, shared learning approaches and clinical guidelines have mixed success in changing behaviours. We know that competency frameworks only go some way in addressing the new skills and roles needed. And we know that we must focus on changing more than the attitudes and behaviours of individual staff or groups of professionals; for change to be implemented in whole systems, there needs to be change at structural and organizational levels.\nThis chapter has illustrated that there are some key levers that can motivate change and enable the successful and sustainable implementation of chronic care models from a workforce perspective. These include conceptualizing a human resources continuum with service users taking a key role, rede\ufb01ning professional roles, developing generic competencies and recon\ufb01guring the prac-tice environment. However, perhaps the most important lesson from this chap-ter is that someone must make and sustain those changes in order to change chronic care. The workforce is that \u201csomeone\u201d \u2013 so we may need to put more effort into considering the needs, perceptions and motivators of workforces in order to facilitate sustainable change.\nReferences Aiken, L.H., Clarke, S.P., Sloane, D.M., Sochalski, J. and Silber, J.H.

They were able to cluster the various common elements in successful approaches in \ufb01ve general areas: \u2022 the use of explicit plans and protocols \u2022 the reorganization of the practice to meet the needs of patients who require more time, a broad array of resources, and closer follow-up \u2022 systematic attention to the information and behavioural-change needs of patients \u2022 ready access to necessary expertise \u2022 supportive information systems.\nHere, \u201cdecision support\u201d sits within the \u201cexpert system\u201d \ufb01eld; it aims to support the decision making of clinicians and is clearly linked to the existing and poten-tial roles electronic communications systems may play in facilitating evidence-based practice (Wagner et al. 1996). More recent iterations of the Chronic Care Model see decision support aiming to \u201cpromote clinical care that is consistent with scienti\ufb01c evidence and patient preferences\u201d (Improving Chronic Illness Care 2007) and encompassing strategies that: \u2022 embed evidence-based guidelines into daily clinical practice \u2022 share evidence-based guidelines and information with patients to encourage their participation \u2022 use proven provider education methods \u2022 integrate specialist expertise and primary care.\nIn his 2003 review of literature on the effectiveness of the components of the Chronic Care Model, Bodenheimer (2003) stated that decision support \u201cinvolves availability to all clinicians of the best evidence-based knowledge through clinical practice guidelines and physician education\u201d.\nThose making treatment decisions remain the focus of decision support strat-egies and tools, although it is acknowledged that these tools may well be used by clinicians in discussions with patients to enhance their patients\u2019 understanding of their conditions and their management. Through use of these tools, includ-ing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines or protocols and/or clinical pathways, clinical care processes are more likely to be standardized, thereby reducing variation in healthcare, increasing quality outcomes and reducing medical error.\nWe here explore the strategies and tools that are included in discussions of decision support. We begin with a general overview of decision support and consider the intended \u201ctargets\u201d for decision support activities and the increas-ing importance of e-health in underpinning decision support interventions. We conclude that decision support embraces a broad array of interventions, increas-ingly reliant on electronic systems for their delivery but having the common purpose of increasing the quality of chronic disease care through the standard-ization of the delivery of care in accord with best evidence-based practice while containing costs.\nNext we consider the connections between wider \u201ce-health\u201d agenda and decision support within the context of chronic disease management. The use of e-health is an essential enabler for the delivery of high-quality chronic disease care, and, therefore, countries must ensure that the necessary e-health building blocks are in place. We discuss computerized clinical decision support systems (CCDSS) in some detail because they are the building blocks for e-health, are supported by an increasing evidence base and provide a means of identifying some challenges that need to be addressed to move forward. In this section, we consider electronic guidelines for clinicians, computerized deci-sion supports directed at enhancing self-management and electronic health records.\nFinally we summarize the key challenges for going forward and suggest some priorities for future research.\nThe scope of decision support for chronic disease management Decision support strategies and tools In general, the term decision support denotes any approach that supports healthcare decision making. The Chronic Care Model places the main focus for decision support strategies and tools on clinicians. This focus for decision sup-port has, however, been broadened to include actions directed at other roles within the health system.\nChronic diseases account for approximately 70% of healthcare costs and affect approximately 20% of Western populations; increasing healthcare expenditures are expected as the number of elderly people living with one or more chronic conditions greatly increases. It is clear that not only clinicians but also patients, healthcare organizations and policy makers are all engaged indirectly in decision Decision support 173 making and are, therefore, also appropriate targets for decision support systems and tools.\nThe overall goal of decision support in chronic care remains the same regard-less of the target chosen: improving the quality of care given to patients with chronic diseases while containing healthcare costs.\nWe have reviewed the literature on chronic care and on decision support and have identi\ufb01ed the different interests that four groups working in the health system would have in respect of a comprehensive decision support system tar-geting that group (Table 8.1). As most studies identi\ufb01ed (descriptive or experi-mental) are context speci\ufb01c, this table is intended to give readers a sense of the inherent diversity and to facilitate adaptation to their own context.\nOne lesson is that the stakeholders may have different expectations and con-\ufb02icting agendas. Planning the design and implementation of a decision support system for one or several chronic conditions, therefore, requires an initial study of the implications for each stakeholder, building this information into the process of choosing between the different priorities.\nTable 8.1 provides a tentative list of the elements to take into account when considering the implementation of a decision support system for chronic condi-tions. It is not clear from the studies that there is a uniform model for leadership of system implementation. The most common model seems to be initiated by clinicians (Kawamoto et al. 2005) for themselves or colleagues in primary care or academic centres. This could be termed a bottom-up model. Top-down models are also seen, for example where excessive prescribing was identi\ufb01ed by the \ufb01nancing administration as part of a package of interventions designed to reduce prescriptions.\nMost activity to date has concentrated on decision supports targeting only the clinician. One of the challenges in going forward is to design, implement and evaluate a variety of strategies and tools that can facilitate quality decision making by all those involved in the delivery of chronic disease care.\nConceptualizing decision support Decision support is broadly conceptualized in the literature. Objectives of deci-sion support systems have been proposed: Imhoff et al. (2001) commenting that clinical decision support \u201caims at providing healthcare professionals with therapy guidelines directly at the point of care\u201d, and Coiera (2003) stating that clinical decision support systems \u201care by and large intended to support health-care workers in the normal course of their duties, assisting with tasks that rely on the manipulation of data and knowledge\u201d.\nSome authors speci\ufb01cally distinguish between the more individualized deci-sion support systems and generic practice guidelines and critical pathways.\nTrowbridge and Weingarten (2001) noted how decision support systems require the input of patient-speci\ufb01c clinical variables and produce patient-speci\ufb01c recommendations, whereas guidelines and pathways typically provide more general suggestions for care and treatment. Liu et al. (2006) supported this differentiation by de\ufb01ning a clinical decision tool as \u201can active knowledge resource that uses patient data to generate case-speci\ufb01c advice which supports 174 N.

They identify four distinctive components in clinical decision tools: \u2022 the target decision maker: the tool is designed to aid a clinical decision by a health professional and/or patient \u2022 the target decision: the decisions concern an individual patient \u2022 the knowledge component: the tool uses patient data and knowledge to generate an interpretation that aids clinical decision making \u2022 the timing: the tool is used before the health professional or patient takes the relevant decision.\nIn order to improve understanding of the diversity of decision tools Liu et al.\n(2006) proposed a typology that enables a conceptualization of the relation-ships between various clinical decision tools in three broad categories: paper based, electronic based and mechanical (Figure 8.1). Although these categories have some utility in a conceptual sense, they are not in fact mutually exclusive.\nFor example, practice guidelines, care pathways and checklists may all be pre-sented in an electronic format while tables of pre- and post-test probabilities may be presented in card format.\nIn summary, the notion of decision support can be seen to embrace a broad array of interventions. Some have typically been paper based, such as guidelines and care pathways. Some are delivered through computerized systems, including Figure 8.1 Conceptualizing clinical decision tools.\nSource: Adapted from Liu J, Wyatt JC, Altman D (2006) Decision tools in healthcare: focus on the problem, not the solution, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 6:4, published through BioMed Central.\n176 N. Glasgow, I. Durand-Zaleski, E. Chan and D. Rubiano prompts and more complex prognostic tools. Some are in the form of educational activities delivered to clinicians or patients through a variety of educational technologies. All are becoming increasingly reliant on electronic systems for their delivery, and all have the common purpose of increasing the quality of chronic disease care through the standardization of the delivery of that care in accordance with best evidence-based practice while containing costs (Table 8.2).\nClinical decision support systems The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society de\ufb01ned clinical decision support (Osheroff et al. 2005) as: . . . providing clinicians or patients with clinical knowledge and patient-related information, intelligently \ufb01ltered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance patient care. Clinical knowledge of interest could range from simple facts and relationship to best practices for managing patients with speci\ufb01c disease states, new medical knowledge from clinical research and other types of information.\nThere are many types of support system. They may be paper based or, increas-ingly, computer based. A useful categorization of various clinical decision sup-port interventions has been suggested by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (see Table 8.3 below). Decision support mechan-isms increase in complexity and in stakeholder involvement.\nPaper-based approaches The simplest forms of support (often paper based) improve physicians\u2019 ordering behaviour but do not address issues of continuity of care and patient empower-ment. The bene\ufb01ts may be limited to a single episode of care and the tool is a top-down system that does not promote physician or patient education. Context-sensitive support systems are certainly more complex to build and implement, not only because of the technical requirement to incorporate past episodes of care but also because they require cooperation by all stakeholders concerned.\nComputerized systems The evolution of CCDSS since the early 1990s mirrors the evolution of the goals of health policy decision makers: from guideline implementation to patient empowerment.\nThe boundaries between paper-based systems and electronic based systems are blurred. For example, CCDSS were rapidly identi\ufb01ed as the most effective tool for guideline implementation, achieving better professional compliance than continuing medical education, audits or paper reminders (Agence Nation-ale d\u2019Accr\u00e9dition et d\u2019\u00c9valuation en Sant\u00e9 2000).

Glasgow, I. Durand-Zaleski, E. Chan and D. Rubiano Health and Ageing report Electronic Decision Support for Australia\u2019s Health Sector (National Electronic Decision Support Taskforce 2003) outlined a typology classi\ufb01cation of electronic decision support developed from work undertaken by the National Health Information Management Advisory Council and the National Institute of Clinical Studies (Box 8.1). Clearly the technical complexity inherent in each of these types progressively increases.\nCareful planning is an important prerequisite when developing any com-puterized clinical decision support system. The different steps in the develop-ment and implementation of these systems are presented in Figure 8.2.\nThe potential for electronic systems to deliver clinical decision support ranges from the simple presentation of information (such as providing the treatment requirements for diabetic patients drawn from national or international guide-lines, without speci\ufb01c reference to the actual patient, doctor or setting) to increasingly complex functionality such as \u201cexpert systems\u201d and \u201cmachine learning systems\u201d (Coiera 2003). Expert systems contain speci\ufb01c knowledge, typically presented as a set of rules, and are able to combine data from indi-vidual patients to propose a decision. Machine learning systems hypothesize relationships within raw data, with some newer technologies even enabling complex characterization of those relationships to be produced. This kind of system is similar to those that Imhoff et al. (2001) referred to as \u201cstatistical and arti\ufb01cially intelligent methods\u201d.\nAccording to Imhoff et al. (2001), the three methodologies employed to acquire the medical knowledge (the necessary rules and facts) required for a decision support system to operate are: \u2022 traditional expert systems: gathering information from experts in the \ufb01eld \u2022 evidence-based methods: evaluation of available medical knowledge, Box 8.1 Electronic decision support for Australia\u2019s health sector This has been divided into four types (National Electronic Decision Sup-port Taskforce (2003).\nType 1 provides categorized information that requires further process-ing and analysis before decisions can be made.\nType 2 presents the clinician with trends of patients\u2019 changing clinical status and alerts clinicians to out-of-range assessments and intervention strategies. Clinicians are prompted to review the alerts before arriving at a decision.\nType 3 uses deductive inference engines to operate on a speci\ufb01c know-ledge base and automatically generates diagnostic or intervention recom-mendations based on the changing clinical condition of the patient.\nType 4 uses more complex knowledge management and inference models such as case management reasoning, neural network or statistical discrimination analysis to perform outcome or prognostic predictions.\nThese systems have self-learning capabilities and use advanced mathemat-ical models to deal intelligently and accurately.\nDecision support 179 therapeutic procedures, methods and established behaviour with reference to healthcare decisions \u2022 statistical and arti\ufb01cial intelligence methods: time series analysis combined with methods for knowledge discovery in large databases and applied to a standard clinical information system.\nIn general, characteristics associated with the development of CCDSS are organ-izational and technical. The development of CCDSS is favoured by having con-sistent guidelines and reimbursement systems that do not create con\ufb02icting incentives. Optimal CCDSS provide timely information, with data automatic-ally retrieved from the electronic medical record and with their output readily useable in the form of a recommended action, and they are integrated into the clinical work\ufb02ow (Kawamoto et al. 2005). Criteria that need to be considered in developing CCDSS innovations include: \u2022 patient-speci\ufb01c capabilities Figure 8.2 Summary of applying clinical decision support to improve outcomes in healthcare organizations.\nSource: Adapted from Osheroff et al.

Rubiano \u2022 an interactive interface (e.g. generates feedback and evaluates physician performance) \u2022 occurrence at the point of care: the information needs to be available at the place and time of the physician\u2013patient encounter \u2022 evolutionary system: the system needs to be able to include new features as the requirements of the patients and the physicians evolve, for example through the natural history of the disease or through changes in the ability to use CDSS \u2022 integration into the daily clinical work\ufb02ow \u2022 integration into the electronic health record \u2022 respect for physician autonomy \u2022 adaptability to patient preference-sensitive subgroups.\nBarriers that need to be addressed from the clinician\u2019s perspective in order to implement CCDSS into clinical work\ufb02ow include: \u2022 physician reluctance \u2022 poor computer literacy \u2022 workable guidelines for use in daily practice \u2022 physicians\u2019 sense of ownership of guidelines (Kawamoto et al. 2005; Nies et al. 2006).\nChronic disease management and e-health policy initiatives Managing chronic diseases in the manner envisaged by the Chronic Care Model requires the development, implementation and operation of e-health systems, seen as essential enablers for the delivery of quality chronic disease care.\nImplementing e-health policies is expensive. Advances in computer technol-ogy occur frequently, and the potential of the latest technology may be grasped before the now \u201cold\u201d technology has been fully exploited. Innovations in e-health often take place within the context of health service reform. Those affected by the proposed changes may be reform weary and, therefore, resistant to change. All of these factors potentially come into play when new interven-tions in clinical decision support systems are considered.\nExamples of e-health platforms Many developed countries are investing substantial resources in e-health pro-grammes. The increasing burden of chronic disease is one of the key policy drivers for these investments; consequently, many e-health programmes con-tain elements directly relevant to chronic disease. The e-health platforms in Canada (Canada Health Infoway 2007), Denmark (Medcom 2007), the United Kingdom (NHS Connecting for Health 2007) and Australia (Health Connect 2007), and the recently proposed French plan for the improvement of the qual-ity of life of people with chronic diseases that has as one of its objectives the establishment of an Internet portal for chronic conditions (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Solidarit\u00e9s 2007), are all examples within which components relevant Decision support 181 to chronic disease management can be identi\ufb01ed. The stated objectives for these platforms include improving access, increasing patient participation, increasing ef\ufb01ciency of delivery and improving care coordination. These plat-forms may include guidelines for professionals, information on diseases for patients, patient education programmes and eligibility criteria for bene\ufb01ts.\nThe technical requirements are described below. A further common feature of these systems is a very high level of governance (Ministry of Health or equiva-lent level), which is consistent with the high stakes in terms of trust and con\ufb01dentiality.\nExamples of e-health building blocks These programmes identify essential \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d in an e-health system.\nThe following building blocks are considered essential for the delivery of opti-mal chronic disease care: \u2022 adequate infrastructure, e.g. broadband connectivity, suitable software and hardware \u2022 agreed technical standards, e.g. for sharing of clinical information \u2022 ability to identify individuals (patients and healthcare practitioners) across the healthcare system with reliability and validity \u2022 adequate protections on access to sensitive clinical information \u2022 interoperable electronic health records \u2022 CCDSS.\nIt is beyond the scope of this chapter to consider all of these in detail. We will however look at CCDSS in detail as these are fundamental to the future of decision support systems.\nComputerized clinical decision support in chronic disease management The use of CCDSS is particularly relevant for chronic disorders. Effective man-agement requires the timely application of evidence-based interventions over time by a healthcare team. In diabetes, for example, decision support systems seek to optimize patient care by ensuring proactive assessments of serum glyco-sylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and other relevant clinical measures, foot exam-inations, eye examinations, dietary advice, exercise advice and medication. The targets of decision support systems include physicians (both hospital and com-munity based) and other members of the multidisciplinary team \u2013 nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals \u2013 as well as those with healthcare management responsibilities.\nCCDSS can thus address many aspects of the management of a patient with chronic disease: test ordering, drug dosage adjustment, patient education, coordination, organization of care, assurance of quality of care and facilitating ef\ufb01ciency within the delivery of care. Existing CCDSS combine some of the following: 182 N. Glasgow, I. Durand-Zaleski, E. Chan and D. Rubiano \u2022 alerts and reminders (e.g. test ordering, recall of patients with particular char-acteristics for clinic visits) \u2022 care plans, organization of care processes \u2022 decision aids (e.g. drug dosing, drug\u2013drug interactions and order entry prompts advising of potential con\ufb02icts) and problem solving provided at the time of the consultation based on real-time patient information \u2022 information retrieval \u2022 assessment of practitioner performance.\nSeveral innovative computer-based decision support approaches have been implemented in chronic care settings. We here consider three approaches illus-trating innovations designed to (1) support decision making in practice, (2) enhance self-management and (3) reach out to the wider health system (shared electronic health records). For each of these we brie\ufb02y summarize their role, the evidence base underpinning this role, and potential areas for future development.\nSupporting decision making: computerized systems Practice guidelines for the management of chronic diseases exist in all countries included in the accompanying volume of case studies. Electronic guidelines are available online but on their own are far from suf\ufb01cient to produce workable CCDSS. During the design process, guidelines must be written in a way that allows their translation into computerized guidelines. The transition from paper-based guidelines to a CCDSS (Aguirre-Junco et al. 2004; Maviglia et al.\n2003) requires: \u2022 making choices on which parts of the guideline will and will not be automated \u2022 deciding the knowledge content of the guideline \u2022 implementing the computerized guideline after encoding in a computer-interpretable guideline format \u2022 integrating the automated guideline into the clinical work\ufb02ow \u2022 tests and validation; evaluation.\nPractitioners require recommendations drawn from guidelines to be patient speci\ufb01c. This means that within the CCDSS there must be linkage between the guideline and the patient electronic record. The structure of electronic patient records and guidelines should be compatible (Barretto et al. 2003).\nEvidence of effectiveness CCDSS have been evaluated in the following conditions: hypertension, dia-betes, depression, heart failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease, osteoarthritis and end-stage renal disease.\nAn early systematic review by Hunt et al. (1998) considered the effects of CCDSS on both healthcare practitioner performance and patient outcome. Prac-titioner performance was assessed as the frequency of compliance with existing Decision support 183 guidelines. For chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and for long-term treatments such as anticoagulation for atrial \ufb01brillation or valve replacement, CCDSS uniformly increased compliance with guidelines. The effect on patient outcome was either not measured or moderate. Comparable results were found in subsequent reviews (Garg et al. 2005; Kawamoto et al.\n2005). Findings of reported evaluations on the effect of decision supports in clinical practice are summarized in Table 8.3.\nUsers\u2019 opinions are generally positive and favour computerized guidelines over paper-based guidelines. Common problems identi\ufb01ed in these studies included poor training or limited computer literacy, reluctance to use the sys-tem during patient consultation and limited scope of the problems covered by the CCDSS. However, it must be remembered that many of these studies were undertaken at a time when computers were less deeply entrenched in everyday life than is now the case.\nChallenges The coexistence of more than one chronic condition is very common, particu-larly for people over the age of 50 years. Two key challenges arise from this: how to construct guidelines that include common comorbidities and how to ensure that, when the guidelines are applied to a particular individual, the CCDSS prompts patient speci\ufb01c information (Van Weel and Schellevis 2006).\nSupporting self-management: interactive health communication One way to make use of electronic connectivity to enhance self-management is through the application of telehealth (Murray et al. 2005): \u201cInteractive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support.\u201d TeleHealth (IHCA) functions include to: \u2022 relay information \u2022 enable informed decision making \u2022 promote health behaviours \u2022 promote peer information exchange and emotional support \u2022 promote self-care \u2022 manage demand on health services.\nBecause there have been a number of developments in this area, we will discuss it in detail Evidence of effectiveness The use of telehealth in chronic diseases has been facilitated by technological developments, greater familiarity with information technology, better informa-tion infrastructures and access to the Worldwide Web (Bodenheimer et al. 2002).\n184 N.

However, the review provided important evidence on the use of decision aids for patients and is, therefore, included here.\nYet despite applications in many chronic conditions, evidence of effectiveness is limited (Table 8.4), although neither is there evidence of negative effects.\nTelehealth interventions might also in\ufb02uence the healthcare system beyond chronic care by restructuring relationships among providers, between providers and payers and between providers and patients. For example, many existing reimbursement schedules fail to allow for reimbursement of education and Internet interactions and new health services that are not currently included in existing bene\ufb01t schedules. An understanding of the need for reform of \ufb01nancing systems and the traditional relationship between healthcare providers is key to success (Park 2006).\nAnother important outcome for a telehealth programme is its potential ability to improve access to healthcare, not only in terms of geographical access but also for those populations that have traditionally been disadvantaged, such as the elderly, minorities or indigent populations. For example, a recent ran-domized controlled trial of the use of telemedicine case management found improvements in glycaemic control of elderly patients with diabetes in areas designated as \u201cmedically underserved\u201d in the state of New York (Shea et al. 2006).\nSupporting health systems: electronic health records Electronic health records (eHR) serve a number of functions: \u2022 patient care delivery \u2022 patient care management \u2022 patient care support processes \u2022 \ufb01nancial and administrative processes \u2022 patient self-management.\nEffective chronic care may ultimately require the widespread availability of elec-tronic health records that can be used as a communication vehicle linking health professionals and patients. When coupled with Internet decision sup-ports, this has been seen as a means to improve the organization of healthcare delivery, in the light of concerns that demands on healthcare practitioners\u2019 time have increased (Mechanic 2001).\nMany excellent suggestions exist for how doctors can use the Internet to communicate with patients, to provide information through a practice website, and to link patients with useful, valid, and relevant sources of information. . . . Such communication can facilitate information \ufb02ow, allow better scheduling of appointments to prevent discontinuity, and avoid gaps in communication. It may also reduce unnecessary appointments, save the patient and doctor time and inconvenience, and contribute to health edu-cation and patient responsibility. . . .Combining these technologies with ancillary staff provide the basis for more effective practice designs.\nEvidence of effectiveness Two studies show some improvement in the care process associated with intro-duction of electronic health records but no effect on subjective or objective Decision support 187 Table 8.4 Evidence of effectiveness of telehealth and interactive health communication applications Reference with abbreviated title Study design Condition/treatment Target Type of intervention Patient outcomes Objective Subjective Quality of care Reduced healthcare costs/use of services Lewis (1999) Computer-based approaches to patient education Systematic review Chronic disease (45% of studies) Patients Computer-based patient education + Murray et al.

The key challenges for the development of electronic health records lie in achieving functional interoperability within health systems. Agreeing technical standards are essen-tial. Implementing nationwide (or statewide) electronic medical records has proved problematical. Substantial costs, budget overruns, unforeseen dif\ufb01cul-ties, negative results and even withdrawal of projects have been reported in the United Kingdom (Hendy et al. 2005), Germany (Tuffs 2004, 2006) and the United States (Burton et al. 2004; Scott et al. 2005).Technical dif\ufb01culties include \ufb02aws in software design, absence of standard formats for physicians\u2019 notes and failure to develop interfaces between the different systems, as well as the high costs of programs. However, these problems appear to be common to major information technology procurements in many sectors.\nCultural issues include concerns about liability, privacy and the evidence that disease management programmes using decision support can succeed without a universal electronic medical record (Litaker et al. 2005; Solberg et al.\n2005).This means that while government and payers struggle with plans for electronic records, other stakeholders experiment with other aspects of the e-health agenda. However e-health provides a unique opportunity to involve patients in the management of their disease by giving them access to sources of information and to decision aids.\nProgrammes that support self-management and home-based care for patients with chronic diseases have shown promising results (Warsi et al. 2004; Chodosh et al. 2005; Deakin et al. 2005; Turnock et al. 2005). Although traditionally relying on courses and written material, modern information technology and, in particular, the wide availability of the Internet and cell phones offer new possibilities for reinforcement and monitoring of patient self-management.\nPatient empowerment through information technology is currently at an experi-mental stage but may have important implications for the general organization of healthcare by shifting to the patient certain tasks currently performed by healthcare practitioners. The current proportion of patients with chronic dis-ease who might use decision support may not be large, perhaps on average 20% of the population, with a higher proportion among younger patients and patients with higher education (Robinson and Thomson 2001). The pharma-ceutical and insurance industries have played a leading role in promoting patient responsibility. Industry-sponsored programmes involving shared deci-sion making and using call centres have allowed patients to take an active part in managing their health (Muir Gray 2002). Physicians may appear to be more reluctant than other stakeholders (Blakeman et al. 2006) and have expressed concerns about the erosion of their professional responsibility (Chapter 7) and the use of this approach by pharmaceutical companies to promote their own products to patients less skilled in critical analysis of evidence of effectiveness.\nQuality criteria for assessing patient decision aids have been developed through international consensus and include speci\ufb01c criteria for Internet-based tools. These quality criteria include the delivery of feedback on the personal health information entered (Elwyn et al. 2006).\nThe development of decision aids for patients poses the same concerns about quality, although on a much larger scale, as does the development of CCDSS for doctors. France has mandated certi\ufb01cation of all decision aids for drug prescrib-Decision support 189 ing. As patient-orientated computerized decision aids are introduced, it is likely that the same regulation will apply.\nConclusions Decision support innovations aimed at improving the quality and safety of chronic disease care should target all those involved in the delivery of that care: clinicians (medical, nursing and allied health professionals), patients and their carers, healthcare managers and policy makers. The nature of the particular decision support will vary.\nDecision support innovations relevant to chronic disease are inseparably intertwined with e-health agendas. Computers are increasingly the platform for delivery of decision supports.\nWithin the Chronic Care Model, decision support activities are directly rele-vant to enhancing self-management through both the electronic presentation of information and telehealth.\nInnovations in clinical decision support are occurring in many parts of the health system. Most often these are focused on one particular chronic condition in one speci\ufb01c health service setting. There is evidence of gains in both quality and safety of care through the deployment of decision support systems. Lessons can be learned from these examples, and extrapolations made from the particu-lar to the more general or from a speci\ufb01c context to another context. However, the challenges of reorganizing health systems so that decision supports are pres-ent and operational in all parts of the system are very large. There are profound implications for traditional relationships such as those between doctor and patient. Patients can become more activated and empowered. There are also profound implications for those who fund health services. New technologies are expensive and new activities need to be funded. There is no certainty that these new expenditures will be offset by savings elsewhere in the system. Reform weariness on the part of clinicians and managers of health services may result in negative perceptions of proposed new initiatives.\nPriorities for future research From this preliminary overview of the existing evidence on the use of decision supports to help in the management of chronic diseases, we have identi\ufb01ed a number of aspects that need further consideration. These should be the subjects of operational research in order that all stakeholders \u2013patients; healthcare pro-viders, payers, healthcare organizations, policy makers and manufacturers \u2013 can bene\ufb01t from adequate tools. The aspects that need consideration can be grouped into three categories: \u2022 research on how to design the tools \u2022 research on implementation \u2022 research on evaluation.\nResearch on how to design the tools involves the standardization of the 190 N. Glasgow, I. Durand-Zaleski, E. Chan and D. Rubiano steps necessary to translate guidelines into CCDSS. Research on implementa-tion concerns how users of decision supports react to these tools and how best to tailor the tools to their needs. This includes, for example, research on how best to incorporate CCDSS into the clinical work\ufb02ow of physicians and what adaptations are required to enable patient preference-sensitive inter-ventions. Research on evaluation addresses both the designs of intervention studies (observational, case\u2013control, time series) and the outcomes used.\nWe have seen that outcomes other than traditional clinical endpoints used in trials are appropriate. These include outcomes designed to measure increased cooperation between stakeholders, such as different health professions and patients, and improved access to health and healthcare for underserved populations.\nReferences Agence Nationale d\u2019Accr\u00e9dition et d\u2019\u00c9valuation en Sant\u00e9 (2000) Ef\ufb01cacit\u00e9 des methodes de mise en \u0153uvre des recommandations m\u00e9dicales.

Durand-Zaleski, E. Chan and D. Rubiano chapter nine Paying for chronic disease care Reinhard Busse and Nicholas Mays Introduction There is no one \u201cbest\u201d way to pay for services for people with chronic health problems, but there is little doubt that payment methods have important impli-cations for the nature and quality of services provided. This chapter focuses on the different methods and combinations of methods available for paying for the care of people with chronic conditions, and the incentives generated by these methods. The chapter will cover incentives for payers/purchasers, pro-viders (organizations, teams and individuals) and patients. Financial incentives can serve as primary motivators or reinforcers of behaviour change among pro-viders, patients and other stakeholders. Yet few incentives in current healthcare systems promote effective chronic care, let alone chronic disease management.\nInstead, the predominant payment schemes represent major barriers. However motivated some healthcare stakeholders may be to implement changes to improve chronic care, few will operate counter to their economic interests (Leatherman et al. 2003). A core element for improving chronic care will, there-fore, be to develop and adopt payment approaches that include appropriate \ufb01nancial incentives.\nTo examine both past and current \ufb01nancing mechanisms, as well as provide policy-relevant options in order to align incentives towards improving care for the chronically ill, the chapter employs an extended triangular model involving the population/payers, the providers and the \ufb01nancial intermediaries (Figure 9.1). The \ufb01nancial intermediaries have, in line with the separation found within most countries, been further subdivided into the \u201c\ufb01nancial pooler\u201d, which collects and pools collective resources for health services, and the \u201cpayer/ purchaser\u201d, which pays for or purchases care for de\ufb01ned parts of the population.\nThe main focus is on how providers are paid to deliver care to people with chronic conditions. However, beyond looking at how such payers/purchasers pay providers (relationship D), the chapter also examines the patient\u2013provider relationship (A) and gives some consideration to \ufb01nancial allocations to payers/ purchasers (C), especially in systems where patients have a choice of payer/ purchaser.\nThe chapter examines the main reasons why payers, purchasers, providers and patients may wish to use reimbursement modalities to increase the emphasis given by frontline staff to the management of chronic disease. It covers the main generic (i.e. not speci\ufb01cally developed for chronic care) approaches used to pay providers, including provider organizations, provider groups and individual providers, and summarizes key examples drawn from different coun-tries, including some of the country case studies in the volume accompanying this book. The chapter then gives particular emphasis to describing so called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d and \u201cquality-based payments\u201d (as de\ufb01ned in Box 9.1) on the grounds that they represent an area of innovation in provider pay-ment that is widely debated in a number of countries, especially the United States and United Kingdom, but potentially relevant to many other high-income settings. Finally, the chapter attempts to summarize the evidence available about the impact of these approaches in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\nTraditional forms of paying for healthcare and their effects on care for chronic conditions Before describing and analysing innovative ways of paying for the care of people with chronic illnesses, it is important to brie\ufb02y review past, and often still current, ways of paying for care and their effects on chronic care.\nFigure 9.1 Financial \ufb02ows related to paying for chronic care.\n196 R. Busse and N. Mays Provider payment/reimbursement Traditionally, there have been three ways for paying physicians and other healthcare professionals from pooled resources (i.e. by insurers or governments; resource \ufb02ow D in Figure 9.1): fee-for-service, capitation and salary. All three have been used to pay providers at different levels in healthcare systems for the management of people with chronic conditions, among other things. However, none of these methods fully aligns \ufb01nancial incentives with the goal of Box 9.1 De\ufb01nitions of key terms Chronic disease management. This is de\ufb01ned as a population-based approach to the treatment of chronic illness using evidence-based clinical guidelines, multidisciplinary management and information systems to produce good outcomes at reasonable cost (Couch 1998; see also Chapter 4). Typically, chronic disease management programmes pay physicians and providers for putting in place appropriate structures and processes of care (e.g. better information systems), including paying for changes in the way that physicians and providers provide care.\nPay-for-performance. By contrast, pay-for-performance has tended to focus on paying for the delivery of speci\ufb01c patient-based outcomes of care, not necessarily exclusively in the \ufb01eld of chronic care. Thus it refers to \u201c\ufb01nancial incentives that reward providers for the achievement of a range of payer objectives, including delivery ef\ufb01ciencies, submission of data and measures to payer, and improving quality and patient safety\u201d (McNamara 2006). It can be applied to hospitals, provider organizations, primary care physicians and their practices, specialists, nursing homes, domiciliary care teams and rehabilitation providers, and it can, in theory, be applied to any condition except the most acute. Pay-for-performance can thus be seen as an emerging component of more established approaches to chronic disease management, which typically include a wider range of techniques designed to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of care.\nQuality-based payment. McNamara (2006) de\ufb01nes quality-based pay-ment (or quality-based purchasing) as a narrower concept than pay-for-performance, since it does not generally include an economic component (i.e. incentives for cost savings or ef\ufb01ciency gains); instead it \u201cfocuses only on \ufb01nancing schemes that embody explicit \ufb01nancial incentives to reward and penalize providers based on the level of quality of care they deliver\u201d.\nQuality, McNamara continues, \u201ccan be pegged to structural benchmarks (e.g. information technology investments), processes of care (e.g. compli-ance with clinical guidelines), and outcomes, including technical out-comes (lower mortality following surgery) and patients\u2019 satisfaction with their care experiences\u201d, but not costs.\nPaying for chronic disease care 197 optimal care for patients with chronic conditions. In effect, each creates differ-ent perverse incentives for patient care.\nFee-for-service involves paying extra money for each unit of service pro-vided and generally motivates providers to increase the amount of service they provide, assuming that the payment offered exceeds the cost to the provider.\nThe incentive under fee-for-service reimbursement is to provide as many reimbursable services as possible, creating the potential for overuse of such ser-vices while failing to provide uncovered services that may be equally or more cost-effective, such as active patient monitoring by phone or computer. The effect on quality is hard to predict. Providers may overprovide services of dubi-ous value on the one hand, yet, on the other hand, they face no incentives to skimp or withhold valuable services. Fee-for-service also minimizes incentives for avoiding patients who are dif\ufb01cult to treat, such as patients with multiple chronic conditions.\nCapitation gives physicians (or other healthcare providers) a \ufb01xed amount to provide services to patients for a particular time, irrespective of the volume of services consumed by individual patients. Thus it generates the opposite incentives of fee-for-service, namely, to provide as little care as possible to each patient as providers paid by capitation bear the \ufb01nancial risk, creating the potential for underuse of services. Under capitation, physicians have the incen-tive to sign up more patients and do less for each, as well as to avoid high users of care such as patients with multiple chronic conditions. In theory, some of these incentives are moderated in situations where patients can choose to enrol with other providers. With choice, providers face some incentives to provide high-quality care to retain patients and income, but they must do so within a budget. If the capitation payment is not risk-adjusted (i.e. if providers do not receive higher capitation payments for patients with higher needs), pro-viders will not be interested in caring for the chronically ill as such patients will cost more to provide services to than the capitation sum based on average patients.\nSalary gives a provider a guaranteed income for a period of time irrespective of how much work is carried out. As a result, there is no particular incentive on providers to over- or under-provide. However, there is also no speci\ufb01c incentive to provide high-quality care (unless the provider works for an organization in competition with other organizations to retain patient af\ufb01liations or maintain workload), and lazy staff may provide little care. While salary may be the most neutral form of clinician reimbursement, much relies on occupational norms, peer pressure and emulation to maintain performance.\nThe payment of institutions (especially acute care hospitals) is one level up in the system, and payment methods include fee-for-service, per diem pay-ments, case fees and budgets. Per diem payments (i.e. a fee per day of inpatient stay) used to be a common way of paying hospitals particularly in social health insurance systems. If per diem prices are uniform across all patients, providers will have incentives to prefer less costly patients or to keep costly patients longer than necessary to recoup their costs through higher total reimbursement.\nAs patients with chronic diseases are increasingly managed primarily in the 198 R. Busse and N. Mays ambulatory care sector, they are hospitalized only for acute complications, which often makes them high-cost patients who are disadvantaged through this payment mechanism. Case fees, especially those known as \u201cdiagnosis related groups\u201d have different incentives. The original system developed in the United States was based on diagnosis only and assumed that all patients in each diag-nosis related group generated similar costs for the hospital, thus effectively sharing \ufb01nancial risk with providers, and perhaps perversely encouraging early discharge. The European adaptations, such as in France, Germany or the Netherlands, include, \ufb01rst, so-called \u201coutliers\u201d, which justify a higher level of reimbursement for dif\ufb01cult cases, and, second, procedures provided by the hos-pital for classi\ufb01cation (Busse et al. 2006), effectively turning them into a hybrid with fee-for-service. Chronically ill people admitted to hospital should bene\ufb01t from such developments, but they are at risk of inappropriate overprovision, as under fee-for-service. Institutional budgets have similar incentives to salaries paid to professionals.\nIn practice, variants of the basic payment methods are often combined into more complex payment systems in order to offset the inherent limitations of each. For example, it is common in the United States to \ufb01nd that salaried staff also receive additional incentive payments or bonuses (e.g. for treating a target number of patients and/or treating them in a timely manner) to mitigate the risk that they will provide poor-quality or too few services. Typically, capitation is coupled with incentives to reward high-quality services whereas salary is linked with output or productivity payments and fee-for-service with induce-ments to be economical, such as a share of any pro\ufb01t that the provider organiza-tion is able to make or by withholding a proportion of the professional\u2019s earnings subject to satisfactory performance. Hence, there is a great deal of interest in developing \u201cblended\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d approaches to payment for chronic disease care as well as for other services. Many pay-for-performance initiatives, as well as paying directly for the delivery of speci\ufb01c measures of quality and/or outcome, use a blend of payment methods. The United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract \ufb01rst implemented in 2004 can be seen as a pay-for-performance blended payment contract in that it comprises capitation, fee-for-service, infrastructure (capital and information technology) payments plus a substantial element of quality-driven remuneration (see below).\nResource generation and (re)allocation Often overlooked are the incentives for payers/purchasers related to the man-agement of people with chronic disease. However, these are critical for the whole system to function properly, especially in countries with competing payers/pur-chasers. Two general situations can be distinguished: the payers receive their \ufb01nancial resources directly from the population (i.e. resource \ufb02ows B and C in Figure 9.1 are not separated) and the payers receive their \ufb01nancial resources from pooled resources (i.e. through resource \ufb02ow C in Figure 9.1).\nIn the \ufb01rst situation, resources allocated to the payers will be either risk related \u2013 thereby disadvantaging the chronically ill, who will face high premiums \u2013 or not risk related, that is, either income or community rated. While this leads to Paying for chronic disease care 199 similar contributions for people with and without chronic illnesses, evidence from several countries shows that expenditure for around 80% of the popula-tion insured is below average while 20% have above-average expenditure and are bad risks (of whom 5% are very bad risks and are responsible for 50% of expend-iture). Financially, insurers will always be better off to try to avoid the (very) bad risks. The insurers are also discouraged from providing high-quality chronic disease management as they risk disproportionately attracting sicker, especially chronically ill, people who want to bene\ufb01t from paying average contributions.\nIn the second situation, the attractiveness of patients with chronic conditions will depend on whether the prevalence of morbidity or chronic illness is included in the formula for calculating the allocation to payers, be they sickness funds in social health insurance systems or local health authorities in tax-funded systems.\nMost formulae have traditionally only included sociodemographic parameters (e.g. age, sex, employment status) and sometimes regional variables (Busse et al.\n2006). While in tax-funded systems with no choice of payer, this may disadvan-tage regions with a higher percentage of chronically ill people, it does not lead to deliberate selection of patients with low risks, or \u201ccream-skimming\u201d. Even if active cream-skimming of healthier persons is often not possible (and not allowed) on the part of competing sickness funds in social health insurance systems, the lack of a morbidity variable in the risk-allocation formulae has meant that sickness funds traditionally had no interest in investing in chronic disease management \u2013 as successful programmes would have increased their popularity with the chronically ill, thereby leading to \ufb01nancial dif\ufb01culties.\nRecently, countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany have begun to address this issue by including morbidity as a factor in the formulae they use to calculate allocations to sickness funds (Van de Ven et al. 2007).\nCost sharing and direct payments A \ufb01nal method of payment for chronic care is patient out-of-pocket payment or copayment (resource \ufb02ow A in Figure 9.1). In most healthcare systems, patient copayments or user charges are the product of historical accident and are rarely designed with chronic care in mind. In general, copayments tend to obstruct good chronic disease care, especially for poorer people, who are normally at greater risk as copayments tend to be attached to the pharmaceuticals essential for good care. In a 2007 meta-analysis of the evidence on cost sharing between 1985 and 2006, Goldman et al. (2007) concluded that increased cost sharing is associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence by existing users and more frequent discontinuation of therapy. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, a landmark study performed in the 1980s, demonstrated that cost sharing reduced appropriate and necessary of\ufb01ce visits and preventive care as well as inappropriate visits, with adverse effects on visual acuity (Lurie et al.\n1989), blood pressure control (Keeler et al. 1985) and survival among high-risk patients (Brook et al. 1983).\nHowever, it is possible to see how varying patient copayments in systems where they are widespread could be used to encourage patients either to take part in chronic disease management programmes or to seek out providers 200 R. Busse and N. Mays who are willing to comply with speci\ufb01c disease management protocols and/or standards (Table 9.2, below, has examples of the use of schemes of this type to promote chronic disease management). The effectiveness of such schemes depends on whether patients interpret the lower out-of-pocket cost or reduced contribution rate as a signal of lower quality and value, or are mainly in\ufb02uenced by the price signals and are thereby attracted to such programmes.\nChronic disease management programmes: rationale, role of incentives and prerequisites There are three main reasons why chronic disease management programmes have come to prominence with payers and/or purchasers in a number of very different health systems: First, the clinical pro\ufb01le and needs of patients have altered dramatically over the last 40\u201350 years. Patients with multiple chronic conditions are now the norm. Unfortunately, the payment modalities in many healthcare systems were developed in an era of largely acute care and are not \ufb01tted to contemporary patterns of morbidity.\nSecond, studies commonly \ufb01nd that some patients do not receive appropriate, high-quality care and are exposed to the risk of medical errors. As a result, payers want to improve quality as a way of containing the rising overall costs of health-care. A sense of \ufb01nancial \u201ccrisis\u201d, perceived as threatening sustainability in some healthcare systems, has encouraged the development of better chronic disease care.\nThird, it is well known that healthcare professionals, and particularly doctors, respond to \ufb01nancial incentives. Experience has also shown that simply giving comparative performance information to providers and other more traditional educational approaches to improvement have comparatively modest, gradual effects on doctors\u2019 performance, but where rapid change is required, it is pos-sible that the rate of improvement could be accelerated by adding \ufb01nancial incentives to the reputation-based incentives produced by making performance information available publicly (either to payers or patients or both).\nProfessionals tend to stress the importance of intrinsic motivation and worry that professional motivation and \ufb02exibility may be damaged by linking \ufb01nan-cial rewards to the performance of particular activities, whereas managers and payers tend to emphasize the importance of extrinsic motivation in improving quality of services. It is likely that both intrinsic and extrinsic incentives for quality improvement are necessary and need to be carefully balanced. This chap-ter focuses on the extrinsic aspect of quality improvement for chronic disease care whereas other chapters focus on other ways of motivating improvements in chronic disease management.\nThe range of reasons for the current vogue for altering payment modalities to encourage better chronic care means that different systems and payers will have different goals in introducing new methods.\nThe prerequisites described below are based on conceptualization and experi-ence to date rather than rigorous evaluation since such evaluation of different approaches is often lacking (see below). There is still contention as to what Paying for chronic disease care 201 are the essential clinical features of good chronic care management or other models (Singh and Ham 2006; see also Chapter 4). However, it is possible to identify many of the wider organizational features of systems that are needed to allow a range of different chronic care approaches a better chance of success.\nThe evidence presented in Chapter 3 indicates that any net returns to the payer from most chronic disease management programmes tend to occur after the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years once the up-front investment in programmes has been made.\nIndeed, the bene\ufb01ts of avoiding severe complications are often only realized after eight to ten years (Eastman et al. 1997). This suggests that continuity of involve-ment with patients on the part of funders/insurers and hence providers (e.g. through patient enrolment), is likely to be one of the most important prerequisites for effective payment systems.\nGiven that bene\ufb01ts and cost savings tend not to appear for several years, it is noteworthy that in most private medical insurance systems, such as those in the United States, patients only stay with an insurer for an average of about three years. While this has not been the case until recently in social health insurance systems, where choice of sickness fund and competition between insurers is only now being encouraged, such as in Germany or the Netherlands, drop-out rates from disease management programmes (in Germany) or signs of a growing tendency to change funds (in the Netherlands) demonstrate that this may also become relevant in those countries. As a result, most chronic disease manage-ment programmes to do not appear to be a good investment for individual insurers.\nYet, as demonstrated in Chapter 3, chronic disease management (e.g. for diabetes) can be a very good investment from a societal point of view because of avoided complications, improved health-related quality of life, long-term cost savings from decreased use of services and less time receiving disability payments, and other bene\ufb01ts such as workplace productivity gains. There is a huge discrepancy between the individual insurer\u2019s weak rationale and the strong societal rationale for chronic disease management. Employers stand to gain potentially but are unlikely to invest heavily unless they are con\ufb01dent that they will have a stable workforce.\nHigh-quality chronic disease management programmes also risk dispropor-tionately attracting sicker people, further discouraging insurers and providers to provide such programmes. This suggests that in systems which offer choice of insurer or sickness fund and/or choice of provider, thereby encouraging a fairly rapid turnover of enrolees and patients, there may need to be a separate system of funding for chronic disease management, probably from public sources, to enable a socially ef\ufb01cient level of management to be provided. From this per-spective, the prospect held out in the Netherlands of competing private insurers offering chronic disease management packages to their insurees in order to be able subsequently to offer them lower premiums appears naive, or at best unlikely to be sustainable if patients move between insurers in any numbers (Klein-Lankhorst and Spreeuwenberg 2008). An alternative approach in social insurance systems with multiple sickness funds or insurers is to develop a sophisticated risk-equalization formula and process that would operate to reallocate resources between insurers or sickness funds as patients change their 202 R. Busse and N. Mays af\ufb01liations, as well as encouraging insurers to take responsibility for people with chronic conditions (resource \ufb02ow C in Figure 9.1). This is, however, extremely challenging technically.\nEven in collective tax-funded or single-payer social health insurance systems, which, in many ways, are much better placed to facilitate long-term chronic disease care, any signi\ufb01cant degree of devolution may encourage the local \u201cinsurers\u201d (i.e. planning or purchasing authorities) to take a short-term view and focus on providing more acute care to deal with current demand rather than investing in chronic disease management with its likely longer term bene-\ufb01ts. There may well be wider political reasons for so doing (e.g. reducing waiting times for elective surgery rather than investing in chronic disease management programmes) as governments are held to account for their achievements over a relatively short time cycle.\nExperience with putting in place chronic disease management programmes indicates that there are a number of other important requirements for effective payment approaches.\n\u2022 The ability ex ante to identify and stratify patients in terms of severity (i.e. risk adjustment for calibrating performance measures, see below) and require-ments for care (i.e. risk adjustment of capitation rates), and to be able to moni-tor patients\u2019 health status over time insofar as performance and outcomes relate to payment.\n\u2022 The availability of widely accepted, evidence-based or informed guidelines or protocols de\ufb01ning \u201cappropriate\u201d and/or \u201ccost-effective\u201d care for different people, and the ability to implement these guidelines and protocols.\n\u2022 The development of carefully chosen, risk-adjusted performance measures, where improvements against these measures will produce measurable improvements in the health of enrolled patients. These are generally likely to be process or quality measures, since outcome measures do not contain spe-ci\ufb01c information about what providers should be changing to improve out-comes and often take too much time to achieve (see above). The measures should be as close as possible to the end of the causal chain from processes to outcomes (Chassin 2006).\n\u2022 Systems are needed that can measure and assess the structure, process quality and outcomes (where relevant) of care ex post.\n\u2022 Motivation of physicians and staff to empower and support their patients to manage their chronic disease: a collaborative approach to chronic disease management involving active patient self-management as well as encourage-ment of patient compliance through various forms of care management. This is more usually found in primary healthcare teams and therefore in systems with well-developed primary healthcare.\n\u2022 An integrated, \ufb02exible workforce is required that is willing and able to cross professional boundaries, conventional team structures and job skills in response to \ufb01nancial incentives and payment modalities (Rechel et al.\n2006).\nThe number and range of these prerequisites explains why payment schemes produce both disappointing and variable results.\nPaying for chronic disease care 203 Speci\ufb01c incentives used to stimulate improved care especially for the chronically ill Table 9.1 summarizes the main ways in which payers can speci\ufb01cally encourage the provision of appropriate chronic disease care. Financial incentives can apply to the structure, processes and outcomes of care, and should be considered in relation to other, non-\ufb01nancial regulations or incentives.\nAt present, the bulk of \ufb01nancial incentives in high-income countries other than the United States relate to the structure or process of care. Only the United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract speci\ufb01cally includes a range of incentive payments focused on the delivery of particular outcomes (see below). In general, there has been a gradual shift of focus from approaches that simply take into account the presence of patients with chronic disease (or who are likely to suffer from chronic illnesses) when funding either purchasers or providers towards payment incentives designed to encourage speci\ufb01c kinds of structural and process response at provider level (e.g. as in the Australian Enhanced Primary Care (EPC) package (Glasgow et al. 2008)).\nCase studies in selected high-income countries compiled for the volume accompanying this book provide a range of examples of the main types of pay-ment and regulatory incentive currently in use to encourage chronic care (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008; Glasgow et al. 2008; Jiwani and Dubois 2008; Karlberg 2008; Klein-Lankhorst and Spreeuwenberg 2008; Schiotz et al. 2008; Table 9.1 Purpose of \ufb01nancial incentives and regulation for chronic disease care Focus Purpose of \ufb01nancial incentives Purpose of other relevant types of regulation Structure To implement DMPs, and recruit and enrol patients in DMPs To put in place \u201cintegrated\u201d forms of care (mostly packages that cross institutional/sectoral boundaries) To implement systems of in-house quality management To detail structural requirements To implement systems of data collection Process To keep patients in DMPs for a target period of time To ensure that the care protocols speci\ufb01ed in DMPs are followed (e.g. in encounters with a speci\ufb01c provider, over x months) To reach prede\ufb01ned targets on process measures (e.g. proportions of patients treated with a particular drug) To mandate evidence-based standards (i.e. clinical practice guidelines) To implement/mandate targets on process measures of quality To reach agreement on minimum volume of services Outcome To reach prede\ufb01ned targets (e.g.\nproportion of patients with outcome x) or to reward the top y% of providers on an indicator To implement/mandate targets on health outcomes and/or patient satisfaction DMP, disease management programme.\n204 R. Busse and N. Mays Siering 2008; Singh and Fahey 2008). The most notable examples of \ufb01nancial incentives in this group of countries are summarized in Table 9.2, organized according to the model for tracing \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows outlined in Figure 9.1. The policy focus in most high-income countries is on provider incentives, given the importance of healthcare professionals, especially physicians, in determining how patients use health services (between payers/purchasers and providers; \ufb02ow D in Figure 9.1).\nThe following sections describe examples of payment initiatives in the coun-tries reviewed for this book and described in the accompanying volume, com-plemented by a description of the United States experience with Medicare pay-for-performance.\nProvider payment incentives Australian Enhanced Primary Care Practice Incentive Programme and Service Improvement Payments After a series of experiments in the 1990s in multidisciplinary care planning and coordinated care, the Commonwealth government in Australia introduced the EPC package in 1999, designed to increase the involvement of general practitioners, practice nurses and allied health professionals in structured and coordinated care based on the Chronic Care Model (see Chapter 4) (Glasgow et al. 2008). Pay-for-performance elements (the Practice Incentive Programme and Service Improvement Payments) were subsequently introduced within the EPC, the bulk of which is paid by fee-for-service, the usual method of pay-ment for general practitioner and related services in Australia. The Practice Incentive Programme and the Service Improvement Payments pay general prac-tices according to whether they have met prescribed quality and service criteria for chronic care (Glasgow et al. 2008). Performance-based payments typically account for less than 10% of the income of a practice.\nThe diabetes Service Improvement Payment pays practices for each patient who has completed an annual cycle of care comprising assessment of glyco-sylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, lipids, weight, behavioural risk factors and screening for complications, and for the proportion of diabetics in the practice who have completed an annual cycle of care. By 2006, over 90% of eligible practices were taking part in the diabetes Practice Incentive Programme; of these, 70% had received Service Improvement Payments and half of these had achieved their outcome targets. The introduction of these programmes was accompanied, in the early 2000s, by improvements in the quality of care for patients with diabetes, though whether these gains would have occurred in any event is not known.\nThe United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract One of the innovations in the 2004 United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract is that general practices are rewarded for delivering care exhibiting par-ticular features deemed to be associated with clinical and organizational quality (Roland 2004; Smith and York 2004). The contract addresses quality in two ways.\nPaying for chronic disease care 205 Table 9.2 Examples of \ufb01nancial incentives for chronic disease care in selected high-income countries Financial \ufb02ows (as in Figure 1) Financial incentives to encourage chronic disease care (patients and services) in different high-income countries Target: patients with chronic conditions Target: structures Target: processes Target: outcomes Patient to provider (A) No copayments for services related to their disease (e.g. ALD in FR for 30 mainly chronic diseases until 2004) Lower annual limits on copayments (GER) Certain drugs require lower cost sharing if indication is deemed serious (FR) ALD exemption only for established and agreed care protocol for each patient (FR since 2004) Cost sharing may be reduced or waived if patients enrol in DMPs (GER) Coverage of additional services (e.g.\npatient education) for patients in DMP/ALD Patients with chronic conditions/ complex needs managed via care plan receive fee rebate for \ufb01ve allied health services per year (e.g.\npodiatry) (AUS) ALD exemption only if care protocol is presented to every treating physician on each visit (FR) Lower cost-sharing limit only if patient adheres to therapy (GER, since 2007) Patient to \ufb01nancial pooler (B) Premium reduction of maximum of 10% for insured under group contracts (e.g. chronically ill) (NL) Insurers are interested in offering premium reductions to DMP participants (NL), but not yet implemented Financial pooler to payer/purchaser (C) Funding (re-) allocation formula between insurers accounts for individual morbidity criteria (i.e.\nindividually risk-rated capitations) (NL, GER from 2009) Funding (re-) allocation formula (RSCS) takes into account patient enrolment in DMPs: sickness funds receive more for patients registered with a DMP and less for those not enrolled, thereby encouraging funds to offer DMPs (GER) (Continued Overleaf) Table 9.2 Continued.\nFinancial \ufb02ows (as in Figure 1) Financial incentives to encourage chronic disease care (patients and services) in different high-income countries Target: patients with chronic conditions Target: structures Target: processes Target: outcomes Payer/purchaser to provider (D) Piloting of \u201cyear of care\u201d payment for complete package of chronic disease management required by individuals with chronic conditions (e.g. based on validated \u201ccare pathways\u201d for diabetes) (DK, UK) Per patient bonus for physicians for acting as gatekeepers for patients with chronic conditions and for setting care protocols (FR) Bonus for DMP recruitment and documentation (GER) 1% of total health budget available for integrated care (GER) Points for achieving structural targets (UK GP contract) Payments to GPs for generic care planning, case conferences, establishing disease registers for patients with chronic disease (AUS, EPC) Additional services (e.g. patient self-management education) only reimbursable if physicians and patients participate in DMP (GER) Points for reaching process targets (UK GP contract) PIP and SIP payments for meeting prescribed quality and service criteria for chronic conditions over an annual care cycle (e.g. for diabetes) (AUS) Additional services (e.g. patient self-management education) only reimbursable if physicians and patients participate in DMP (GER) Points for achieving outcome targets (UK GP contract) ALD, affections de longue dure\u00e9; AUS, Australia; DMP, disease management programme; DK, Denmark; EPC, enhanced primary care programme; GP, general practitioner; FR, France; GER, Germany; NL, Netherlands; PIP, practice incentive programme; RSCS, risk structure compensation scheme; SIP, service improvement payments; UK, United Kingdom.\nFirst, it sets out a range of quality-related requirements that have to be ful\ufb01lled by providers in order to be contracted to the NHS (e.g. having a practice information lea\ufb02et for patients, a system to handle patient complaints, safety policies and a system to enable quality assurance). Second, it includes a system of \ufb01nancial incentives for clinical and organizational quality. Traditionally, NHS funding of general practitioners has been largely on the basis of the number of patients registered with a practice, although there were exceptions such as target-driven payments for cervical cancer screening and child immunizations. Now, quality rewards make a substantial part of the funding (typically 25% of a general practice\u2019s income) in addition to capitation and infrastructure payments.\nPerformance is measured using a Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) especially developed for this purpose. The framework focuses on four main components, one of which (clinical standards) is linked directly to the care of people with ten chronic conditions: coronary heart disease, stroke or transient ischaemic attacks, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease, epilepsy, cancer, mental health problems, hypothyroidism and asthma (Box 9.2).\nIn 2006\u201307, other indicators were added covering heart failure, palliative care, dementia, depression, chronic kidney disease, atrial \ufb01brillation, obesity, learning disabilities and smoking, with a greater emphasis on prevention. The other three Box 9.2 The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in the United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) for achieving clinical qual-ity standards was developed on the basis of the best currently available evidence. To link payments to the achievement of quality standards, a system of points was developed to an original maximum of 1050 (cur-rently 1000). The maximum number of points achievable for each indica-tor is related to the associated workload. The 80 clinical indicators in 19 areas account for 66% of the total number of points achievable by a practice. Most points are available for ischaemic heart disease (121), hypertension (105) and diabetes (99).\nFor clinical indicators, indicator points are awarded in a simple linear relationship to achievement between a minimum and maximum achiev-able. By contrast, points are based on a yes/no determination for organiza-tional or patient experience indicators. For example, for controlling blood pressure in diabetic patients (i.e. achieving a blood pressure of 145/ 85 mmHg or less) a maximum of 17 points can be achieved. No points are achieved until 25% of patients have controlled blood pressure; the max-imum practically achievable has been set at 55%. If a practice achieves this target blood pressure in 55% of its diabetic patients, it will be given the full score for this indicator. If the target is achieved in, say, only 30% of the diabetic patients, the practice will get a score for this indicator of only 2.8 points; i.e. 5(30% \u2013 25%) 30ths(55% \u2013 25%) of 17.\n208 R. Busse and N. Mays components of quality are organizational quality standards (in \ufb01ve areas), the experience of patients (consultation length and results of patient surveys) and the provision of additional services (in four areas: cervical screening, child health surveillance, maternity services and contraceptive services). Each component is made operational through a comprehensive list of over 150 indicators that describe performance (selected examples are given in Table 9.3).\nThe approach is not prescriptive; it leaves it to each practice to decide in which domains of quality and targets to concentrate its efforts. However, the contract includes a small bonus mechanism to reward the breadth of the quality improvement focus, in addition to the incentives described above, which reward the depth of the improvements.\nIn the \ufb01rst year of the new contract, the median practice achieved 83% of the maximum total number of points (Doran et al. 2006), exceeding the govern-ment\u2019s predictions. Performance in the second year was even stronger, with the median practice attaining 87% of the maximum number of points. Performance in the third year (2006\u201307) was stronger still, with 95% of practices scoring the maximum number of points (Information Centre 2007).\nIn 2006, the QOF was modi\ufb01ed, partly in response to a perception that the targets were too easy to achieve. All minimum, and some of the maximum, thresholds attracting points were increased. Thirty indicators were dropped or altered and 18 new clinical areas were introduced (e.g. depression) to give greater weight to areas such as mental health, which was regarded as under-represented in the QOF. The biggest query about the QOF remains whether it genuinely encourages better quality care or simply rewards successful under-taking of speci\ufb01c activities and completeness of recording (see below). Since payments are made in relation to the number of points achieved by a practice, the QOF is not a zero sum game and has resulted in an increase in spending on general practices in the NHS. As a result, the rewards of the better performers have not been at the expense of the poorer performers.\nTable 9.3 Examples of indicators, targets and point values for chronic disease manage-ment in the United Kingdom NHS general practitioner contract Type Indicator Points Target range Structural The practice establishes a register for patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (STROKE1) 4 Yes/no Process The percentage of patients with history of myocardial infarction who are currently treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CHD11) 7 25\u201370% Outcome The percentage of patients with diabetes in whom the last blood pressure was 145/85 mgHg or less (DM12) 17 25\u201355% Outcome The percentage of patients age 16 years and over on drug treatment for epilepsy who have been convulsion free for last 12 months recorded in last 15 months (EPILEPSY4) 6 25\u201370% Source: British Medical Association 2003.\nPaying for chronic disease care 209 The \u201cyear of care\u201d approach The \u201cyear of care\u201d approach is a costed \u201cpackage\u201d approach to paying for chronic disease care derived from managed care in the United States, but adapted for the circumstances of the United Kingdom NHS and designed to encourage continuity and integration of a full range of care for individuals over a concerted period of time (a year). The NHS de\ufb01nes this approach as, \u201c[t]he ongoing care a person with a chronic condition should expect to receive in a year, including support for self-management, which can then be costed and com-missioned. It involves individuals through the care planning process, enabling them to exercise choice in the design of a package to meet their needs\u201d (Centre for Clinical Management Development 2007).\nThe amount of funding available for the \u201cyear of care\u201d is calculated using a risk-adjusted capitation formula based on the likely consumption of a range of necessary health services over a 12-month period for people with speci\ufb01c diag-noses. \u201cYear of care\u201d funding has been developed for people with diabetes and a range of mental health problems and is being piloted and evaluated.\nThe United States Medicare pay-for-performance demonstration This Medicare pay-for-performance initiative in the United States comprised a series of demonstration pilots, initially with ten large multispecialty group prac-tices, that started in 2005, though there are plans to extend the demonstration to solo and small group practices with fewer support staff and a narrower range of specialties. Practices are paid by fee-for-service in the normal way, but, in addition, there is a \ufb01nancial incentive for improved chronic care. The practices share 80:20 with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services any savings on the usual cost they are able to make by improving their outcomes and/or reducing their costs of care for patients with costly conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Half-way through the three-year trials, the practices were reported to be making encourag-ing progress in identifying Medicare patients with chronic, high-cost conditions and closing the gaps in their care, thereby avoiding costly hospital stays (Klein 2006). The participating groups take the decision to invest their own resources in the systems needed to track and follow up patients on the basis that they can make signi\ufb01cant savings. They are being compared with a control group of matched patients in the same geographic area managed by other practices. If the group practice quali\ufb01es for the savings bonus, a proportion of it is tied to the group\u2019s performance on a range of quality targets to prevent the accumulation of savings simply by reducing the quality of care.\nIncentives for payers/purchasers Risk structure compensation scheme There are relatively few examples of chronic disease management incentives directed at payers/purchasers. However, in 2002 in Germany, where there is free patient choice among not-for-pro\ufb01t sickness funds, the formula used to 210 R. Busse and N. Mays reallocate revenue between funds to ensure that each is fairly funded for the likely costs of meeting the healthcare needs of its enrolees was amended to give extra funding for enrolees registered with a chronic disease management pro-gramme (initially con\ufb01ned to diabetes, breast cancer, asthma and coronary heart disease and subject to minimum standards) (Busse 2004; Siering 2008).\nInstead of patients with chronic conditions generating de\ufb01cits for sickness funds, they are now relatively attractive. Despite contention between the sick-ness funds and physicians\u2019 associations as to what constituted the minimum standards for chronic disease management programmes and the patient care documentation needed, this reform has led to a rapid rise in the provision of disease management programmes by sickness funds and of the number of patients enrolled in them, though critics argue that the scheme does not pro-vide incentives for sickness funds to improve the care of people with chronic conditions as much as to enrol them in schemes and be compensated more highly as a result.\nIncentives for patients Financial incentive schemes targeted directly at patients to promote chronic disease management are also relatively uncommon. For example, hitherto, schemes involving differential copayments have been regarded as politically unacceptable in the United Kingdom NHS. However, there are schemes in both France and Germany where the general use of copayments is more common. In Germany, cost sharing may be reduced or waived entirely for patients enrolled with speci\ufb01c chronic disease management programmes. Patients choosing to become involved in chronic disease management programmes also have access to additional services that other patients are not eligible for, and patients com-pliant with chronic disease management protocols are eligible for further reduc-tions in their copayments (Siering 2008). In France, patients are exempt from chronic disease management copayments if they present their previously agreed care protocol at every physician visit (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008).\nEvaluations of these schemes have yet to be published.\nAnother theoretical approach to altering what patients pay to promote their involvement in, and access to, chronic care would be to lower patients\u2019 insur-ance contributions (in private and social insurance systems) in return for their participation in validated chronic disease management programmes. This could be combined with lower copayments for speci\ufb01c services (A and B in Figure 9.1).\nEvidence about the impact of different payment methods This section reviews the evidence on the different (\ufb01nancial) incentive systems to encourage better chronic disease management that have been described in the previous section.\nThere are surprisingly few high-quality studies of different payment methods designed to improve the quality and/or ef\ufb01ciency of care for chronic disease (i.e.\npay-for-performance and quality-based purchasing, in particular) despite the Paying for chronic disease care 211 strong interest in using \ufb01nancial incentives to improve healthcare quality. The best evidence comes from the United States and so has to be interpreted care-fully for use elsewhere. Furthermore, much of the evidence comes from single case studies of schemes rather than rigorous comparative studies. As a result, there is considerable scope for debate as to the relative effectiveness of schemes; how they work; which are the most in\ufb02uential components of programmes; in which circumstances different approaches might work best; the best size, fre-quency and duration of incentives; whether rewards should be focused on the highest performers, on those who have improved or should relate to an absolute standard; how many performance domains to concentrate on at any one time; how \ufb01nancial incentives interact with other tools for quality improvement (e.g.\nreputational incentives generated by, for instance, publication of performance information where patients can choose providers); the costs of programmes in relation to their bene\ufb01ts; and the nature of the barriers and enablers of effective approaches.\nWhile earlier reviews consistently concluded that there was a lack of evidence on the effects of different ways of paying providers for chronic care, including pay-for-performance (Eichler et al. 2001; Gosden et al. 2001; Institute of Medicine 2001; Dudley et al. 2004), one of the most recent reviews by Petersen and colleagues (2006) suggested that pay-for-performance has some positive effects, especially when its impact is monitored carefully. However, Fr\u00f8lich and colleagues (2007) remained doubtful, stating: \u201cP4P [pay-for-performance] and PR [public reporting of performance] incentives intended to improve quality are now used worldwide. Despite this, there is relatively little research showing whether such incentives improve quality. We found little empirical evidence upon which to base the design of incentive programs, no comprehensive con-ceptual models of how incentives should work, and a disconnection between reported research and theory.\u201d Despite some accumulation of information recently, there is little evidence about which performance targets/standards providers should be encouraged to achieve; what sort and scale of \ufb01nancial inducements, and combinations of incentives, are needed for what degree of change; how payments should be structured; and at what level incentives should be targeted (i.e. entire health plans, integrated organizations offering disease management services (e.g.\ndisease-speci\ufb01c \u201ccarve outs\u201d), group practices/physician partnerships, individual clinical teams or physicians, patients or some combination of these). It is gener-ally held that incentive schemes should not rely exclusively on patient-level outcome indicators but should include a majority of structure and process measures of quality. This is because chronic disease outcomes are normally dependent on a range of factors, including patient involvement and compliance that are partly outside the control of chronic disease management programmes.\nTherefore, payments should be for performance largely on the basis of structures and processes rather than patient outcomes since the outcomes achieved are not necessarily always a direct re\ufb02ection of the quality of services (Beich et al. 2006).\nThere is clearly growing interest in a range of different ways of changing payment methods to improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of care, including for people with chronic conditions. This has led to more demonstra-tion schemes and increased the scope for empirical work, especially in the 212 R. Busse and N. Mays United States, to remedy the relative dearth of evaluative studies. As a result, a number of preliminary evaluations of several different incentive approaches are becoming available.\nQuality-based purchasing The Agency for Healthcare Quality has reviewed the evidence from the United States on the effectiveness and potential of both reputational and payment-driven quality-based purchasing schemes designed to improve the quality of care (Dudley et al. 2004). The review identi\ufb01ed eight very varied trials of performance-based payment, each of which used different \ufb01nancial incen-tives and different measures of performance. The trials were mainly related to prevention and there was only one speci\ufb01cally directed at chronic care. In four studies, the recipient of the incentive was an individual provider, while in the other four the recipient was the provider group or could be either an individual provider or a group. Among the studies targeting individual providers, there were \ufb01ve positive and two negative results; among the studies in which the tar-get was or could be the provider group, there were one positive and two negative results (in general, the term positive was used to mean an effect in the desired direction (i.e. the incentive worked) and negative to mean there was no signi\ufb01-cant effect of the incentive on the outcome measure). In seven studies, the target of the incentive was a physician. Of the nine dependent variables assessed, \ufb01ve showed a signi\ufb01cant relationship to the incentive in the expected direction and four showed no signi\ufb01cant change after the incentive was introduced. A single study involved pharmacists and achieved positive results.\nThere was no consistent relationship between the magnitude of the incentive and response, although the studies were so heterogeneous that this is not sur-prising. Among the fee-for-service studies, four were positive and one was nega-tive. Among the bonus studies, two were positive and three were negative. There were seven studies of preventive care with nine dependent variables assessed.\nAmong these nine outcomes, \ufb01ve were positive and four were negative. The single study on chronic care was positive. Generally, incentives to achieve per-formance were found to be more effective when the indicator to be followed required less patient cooperation (e.g. receiving vaccinations or answering ques-tions about smoking) than when signi\ufb01cant patient cooperation was needed (e.g. to quit smoking).\nThe authors concluded that, to date, there are few unequivocal data on which to base a quality-based purchasing strategy, but some evidence that both pay-ment and reputational incentives can work. They suggest that, with appropriate caution, outcome measures can be included among the performance indicators used for quality-based purchasing, and not just structure and process indicators.\nPay-for-performance initiatives in the United States Even though studies published so far cannot provide de\ufb01nitive evidence, they provide generally positive \ufb01ndings on pay-for-performance at the level of Paying for chronic disease care 213 individual hospitals, insurers\u2019 programmes or large, integrated healthcare deliv-ery networks. Unfortunately, and not uncommonly, it is still not possible to conclude which aspect of the intervention created the advantage over the comparators and there is no information about the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (Galvin 2006).\nPetersen and colleagues (2006) offer perhaps the most up-to-date systematic review of the evidence on explicit \ufb01nancial incentives and improvements in quality measures. They identi\ufb01ed 17 studies, 13 assessing process measures of quality, mostly for preventive services. Only two studies compared the type of incentive (bonus versus enhanced fee-for-service). Only \ufb01ve studies were spe-ci\ufb01c to patients with chronic disease. Of these, one used the payment system to encourage skilled nursing home providers to take on elderly patients with chronic disease and improve their health status so that as many as possible could be discharged to their homes (positive effect of bonus payment); a second used the payment system to encourage providers to offer services to young people with substance abuse, psychological problems and criminal histories (to prevent cream-skimming in a system offering additional funding for more effective and ef\ufb01cient services); a third encouraged community mental health centres to provide case management of clients in the community (partial effect of enhanced fee-for-service); a fourth encouraged provider groups to screen dia-betic patients for HbA1c (partial effect of bonus per member per month if target rates could be met or exceeded); and the \ufb01nal study encouraged individual phys-icians to meet quality targets for their diabetic patients based on process and outcome measures (e.g. serum low density lipoprotein and low density lipo-protein cholesterol, retinal examination) (partial effect of bonus paid in relation to achieving or exceeding individual targets and score on composite index of quality).\nFive of the six studies of physician-level \ufb01nancial incentives and seven of nine studies of provider group-level \ufb01nancial incentives found partial or positive effects on measures of quality. One of the two studies of incentives at the level of the payment system found a positive effect on access to care, but the other showed signs of patient cream-skimming, indicating that access to care might have deteriorated. The authors found no studies looking at the duration of incen-tives or the persistence of any effects if incentives were removed. There was only one cost-effectiveness study, which happened to relate to people with chronic conditions. It showed that a combination of incentives could improve patients\u2019 access to nursing homes and the outcomes of nursing home care as well as saving US$3000 (\u00011978) per nursing home stay. However, because of the struc-ture of the payment system, the savings might not accrue to Medicaid, which had paid for the incentives.\nStudies to date also raise some important issues, especially about the detailed implementation of pay-for-performance initiatives (Hackbarth 2006).\n\u2022 Financial incentives for quality are likely to be worth pursuing but require very careful design since there is some evidence of perverse responses to incentives (i.e. excessive focus on incentive-linked versus other tasks or areas of quality, gaming or better reporting without any improvement in quality).\n\u2022 The objectives of any scheme need to be clearly de\ufb01ned, in particular whether 214 R. Busse and N. Mays the goal is to improve the performance at the bottom of the distribution, raise the mean, increase the proportion of providers achieving a standard or reward the best.\n\u2022 Collecting the data needed for pay-for-performance programmes can be costly and the data may not always accurately capture performance (e.g. risk-adjusted, detailed clinical data are needed to make valid comparisons between providers).\n\u2022 Providers expend considerable resources trying to earn incentive payments (Chassin 2006); consequently, programmes are costly in terms of providers\u2019 time.\n\u2022 The performance measures used in incentive programmes have to be chosen with great care to ensure that they are associated with health improvements, since providers target their quality-improvement efforts on areas that might earn them additional payments (Chassin 2006); incentives combining pro-cess and outcome measures of quality (e.g. provision of smoking cessation advice and quit rates) may mitigate the disadvantages of either approach taken alone (i.e. process measures tend to be more susceptible to gaming and outcome measures may not be sensitive to quality of care since they may be partly outside the control of providers).\n\u2022 The size of the incentive is probably important though the amount of empir-ical work on this is negligible, so it is dif\ufb01cult to determine what proportion of provider income should be put at risk in such schemes. In these circumstances, it seems sensible not to offer excessively highly powered incentives.\n\u2022 Continuous incentives may be more in\ufb02uential than, for instance, an end-of-year bonus.\n\u2022 Financial incentives alone do not improve care in that incentives must in\ufb02u-ence frontline staff to alter what they do with, and for, patients, which means that staff must know what to change in terms of the structure of their practices and their processes of care.\n\u2022 Effects of \ufb01nancial incentives tend to be small at the provider group (or hos-pital) level but somewhat larger at the level of individual professionals, most likely because individuals cannot obtain the full bene\ufb01ts of their own efforts under schemes operating at higher levels. However, the evidence from studies of the Chronic Care Model (Bodenheimer et al. 2002a, 2002b) tend to show that multidisciplinary teams produce better outcomes, suggesting that incen-tives at team level might be a feasible compromise between levels. The experi-ence of the US Veterans Health Administration suggests that provider group incentives even without large monetary incentives for physicians can be effec-tive in the presence of rigorous performance monitoring and benchmarking between provider groups (Kerr and Fleming 2007).\nFinally, Petersen et al. (2006) offer an interesting theoretical justi\ufb01cation for pay-for-performance relating to the information asymmetry that is generally said to lie at the heart of healthcare. They argue that because patient demand may be relatively unresponsive to the technical quality of clinical care, since most patients cannot observe or know the skill expended by clinical staff, \ufb01nan-cial incentives that reward high quality should contribute to protecting patients\u2019 interests, irrespective of their level of awareness of provider quality.\nPaying for chronic disease care 215 Evaluation of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in the United Kingdom The QOF was introduced in April 2004 when the quality of care for many com-mon chronic diseases in United Kingdom general practices was already steadily improving (Campbell et al. 2005). In the four years since initiation, the QOF has demonstrated two things: generously funded pay-for-performance programmes can be popular with primary care physicians and their staff, and pay-for-performance programmes focus clinical behaviour on the aspects of care that are linked to incentives. Critics have argued that the QOF is poor value-for-money since it merely rewarded practices (handsomely) for what they were already doing in relation to chronic disease management, paid them for more activity not necessarily related to health improvement and simply rewarded the better organized practices excessively for improving their record keeping rather than their care. However, independent evaluation of the quality of care for three common chronic conditions in the QOF (angina, diabetes and asthma) using chart review in a representative sample of practices, rather than QOF returns, indicated strongly that quality (irrespective of value for money) continued to improve after 2004 when the QOF incentives were introduced and at a faster rate for asthma and diabetes than in the earlier period. For example, the per-centage of patients with coronary heart disease with a serum cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/l had increased from 18% in 1998 to 61% in 2003, but at the end of the \ufb01rst year of the QOF it had reached 71%. The percentage of patients with diabetes whose HbA1c was less than 7.4 mmol/l increased from 38% in 1998 to 40% in 2003, but 58% after 12 months of the QOF.\nThere was also a statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in improvement between areas of performance linked to incentives by the QOF and those not, suggest-ing some causal effect of the QOF on quality (Campbell et al. 2007). The authors concluded that pay-for-performance is a useful means to augment other approaches to quality improvement in chronic disease care.\nHowever, general practices in more socioeconomically deprived areas tended to have lower levels of achievement and received less \ufb01nancial reward for the same level of achievement (Guthrie et al. 2006), though the differences between practices in more and less advantaged areas were small (Doran et al. 2006) and there were signs of \u201ccatch up\u201d among practices in more-deprived areas over time (Ashworth et al. 2007). In addition, patients in deprived areas were less likely to be registered with a general practice and thereby less likely to be able to bene\ufb01t from the care improvements reported.\nThe performance improvements identi\ufb01ed are likely to be the result of the better organization of care at general practice level, in particular the provision of more systematic care, which tends to favour larger practices (Wang et al. 2006).\nThis is manifest in a number of ways, such as more effective recall of patients with established risk factors for chronic disease, leading to better follow-up, and greater use of protocol-driven care, including templates for recording consulta-tions, leading to better recording of care and more focused and effective clinical encounters. The QOF is also stimulating an expansion of the role of nurses in primary care. Finally, the quality gains observed would not have been possible without a well-established information technology infrastructure throughout 216 R. Busse and N. Mays United Kingdom general practice, allowing practices to understand where they started from before the new contract.\nConclusions Countries and health systems vary in the degree to which overall system characteristics support or frustrate efforts to enable and support services for people with chronic diseases. In very general terms, systems face the greatest dif\ufb01culties in adapting their payment arrangements to become more con-ducive to effective chronic disease care if they have a tradition of patient choice of any provider, and/or of little or no enrolment with particular pro-viders and/or of paying for services episodically using fee-for-service as the predominant method of reimbursement. This is because such systems tend to discourage continuity of care or a provider focus on a population of patients.\nMany of the most widely discussed approaches to the management of chronic disease are extremely dif\ufb01cult to implement in such fragmented, fee-for-service systems.\nSystems with strong primary healthcare are more likely to give greater atten-tion to the management of people with chronic conditions and to obtain better results in this area. For example, the United Kingdom has reasonably good performance on chronic disease outcomes for conditions such as asthma and diabetes compared with similar countries (Nolte et al. 2006). It is also no coincidence that the United Kingdom NHS has recently been able develop some of the most innovative methods internationally of paying for improvements in the quality and outcome of chronic disease care because it has a well-developed primary care system, patient enrolment with primary care physician practices, gatekeeping by general practitioners and experience of paying for ambulatory care through a mixed mode contract that includes elements of capitation, fee-for-service and target payments.\nAnother commonly experienced barrier to encouraging the appropriate man-agement of people with chronic conditions is the tendency in some systems to pay separately for the care of speci\ufb01c diseases (again, a throwback to a period when it might reasonably be assumed that most patients had a single condition at a time requiring professional attention). Indeed, in most countries, chronic disease management programmes have tended to evolve condition by condi-tion (Anderson and Knickman 2001). Yet, in reality, chronic illness lies along a continuum (i.e. from the asymptomatic person at risk to those with a range of established chronic illnesses) and chronic conditions (and their related risk fac-tors) are increasingly seen as being strongly interrelated.\nYet another, similar, commonly encountered barrier related to system frag-mentation, is a tendency in many systems to pay different healthcare profes-sionals separately, thereby perpetuating traditions of independent, solo practice.\nMuch effective care of people with chronic conditions appears to depend on multidisciplinary team work, yet this is frequently frustrated by these payment systems. For example, the Australian EPC initiative has been hampered by the fact that payment for involvement in care planning and case conferences for patients with chronic disease is only available to general practitioners and not Paying for chronic disease care 217 to other healthcare professionals whose input is important for effective case management.\nIn response to such obstacles, policy makers and payers have been increas-ingly looking for ways of bringing together (bundling) different budgets and sources of funding for different activities and different types of professional to produce more patient-centred methods of payment, rather than paying differ-ent professionals separately for individual activities (e.g. the Coordinated Care Trials in Australia and the development of capitated primary health organiza-tions in New Zealand since 2001). They have also begun to develop \u201cblended\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d approaches to payment for chronic disease care, which attempt to capture the bene\ufb01ts and offset the drawbacks of each separate payment modal-ity. Many pay-for-performance initiatives use a blend of payment methods, including paying directly for the delivery of speci\ufb01c measures of quality and/or outcomes. For example, Goroll et al. (2007) have proposed an alternative to the preponderant encounter-based, fee-for-service payment methods found in the United States in the form of a mix of comprehensive risk-adjusted capitation payments, including an amount for infrastructure and care coordination, and risk-adjusted performance bonuses to mitigate the disadvantages of capitation.\nThis chapter has focused particularly on recent high-pro\ufb01le pay-for-performance initiatives such as the 2004 general practice contract in the United Kingdom NHS and the current demonstration programmes of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the United States. It has shown that \ufb01nancial incentives to encourage providers to undertake desirable activities may be effective in improving performance in chronic care. However, the volume of evaluative research in this \ufb01eld is still comparatively small given the many com-plexities inherent in designing payment systems, especially ones that include elements of pay-for-performance. For example, there is little or no research where the size of \ufb01nancial incentives has been varied to establish the nature of any \u201cdose\u2013response\u201d relationship or understanding of the costs to providers of complying with the quality goals in programmes. In addition, there is no estab-lished conceptual model in the literature as to how \ufb01nancial incentives such as pay-for-performance should work and what factors would facilitate or reduce their impact (Fr\u00f8lich et al. 2007).\nIn these circumstances, policy development should be cautious. For example, it cannot be assumed that the \ufb01nancial elements in pay-for-performance schemes are always the major motive for professionals to change their prac-tice (Marshall and Harrison 2005). Professionals are motivated by more than remuneration. In particular, physicians and other healthcare professionals respond to reputational incentives, particularly where performance informa-tion is published, though remuneration remains a powerful lever for change.\nThere is also extensive psychological evidence that excessive use of externally imposed incentives, particularly \ufb01nancial ones, can \u201ccrowd out\u201d the internal motivation to do a good job in areas that are not the subject of extrinsic rewards.\nThis suggests further cautions: that pay-for-performance should not constitute too large a part of the remuneration of the typical provider and that, as far as possible, the indicators of performance used should be supported by the target population of professionals and aligned with their conceptions of what a high-quality service comprises.\n218 R.

There is now considerable empirical evidence to support the intuitive belief that fragmenta-tion of services makes it dif\ufb01cult to implement the integrated strategies needed (Busse 2004; Epping-Jordan et al. 2004; Segal et al. 2004). However, even when the basic structure of the health system is supportive with, for example, well-developed primary healthcare, there are also barriers to be overcome all along the continuum of care (Calnan et al. 2006).\nThis concluding chapter explores the challenges that exist and seeks to iden-tify ways of overcoming them. We begin by reviewing the evidence on barriers to coordination and integration. We then examine the various approaches taken by different countries to address them; we describe trends emerging in different healthcare settings, drawing on detailed country case studies pub-lished in a companion volume to this book (Nolte et al. 2008). We seek to understand these trends, looking at the drivers of policies, the overall vision underlying them and the understanding and commitment of policy makers, seeking insights into how these shape the resulting strategies. By doing so, we seek to identify facilitators and barriers related to the implementation of successful chronic care policies.\nThe need for new models of care This volume demonstrates clearly why the traditional acute episodic model of care is ill-equipped to meet the long-term, \ufb02uctuating needs of those with chronic illness and why, as a result, there is a need for new service delivery models that are characterized by collaboration and cooperation among professions and institutions that have traditionally worked separately. The growing recogni-tion of this need (Boerma 2006) is causing many countries to explore new approaches to healthcare delivery that can bridge the boundaries between professions, providers and institutions and so provide appropriate support to patients.\nCoordination of care is at the heart of the problem. Patients value coordi-nation of their care, seeing it as an important component of overall quality (Calnan et al. 2006) especially when they have chronic health problems and complex needs (Alazri et al. 2006; Turner et al. 2007). A recent survey of patients\u2019 experience in seven countries demonstrated how at least three-quarters of adults considered it important to have somewhere where they are known and where they can obtain assistance in coordinating their care (Schoen et al. 2007).\nYet only half of patients with chronic conditions (approximately 60% in Australia and New Zealand) reported having access to a doctor or other source of care that would routinely help coordinate the services they required (a \u201cmedical home\u201d) (Figure 10.1). Importantly, a relatively high proportion had used mul-tiple providers and care settings, with between 25% (New Zealand) and 55% (Germany) reporting use of multiple specialists in the preceding year, a re\ufb02ection of suboptimal coordination of care.\nChapter 6 reviewed the now ample evidence that helping patients to self-manage their condition improves clinical and other outcomes (Singh 2005; Zwar et al. 2006), although the precise bene\ufb01ts vary according to the disease processes involved. Yet, the survey of seven countries found that only a small percentage of those with chronic health problems are given written instructions on management of their condition at home, with just over 20% in Germany Figure 10.1 Experience of patients with chronic conditions in seven countries.\nSource: Adapted from Schoen et al. (2007).\nMaking it happen 223 and 33% in Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, 40% in Australia and just over 50% in the United States (Schoen et al. 2007). More worryingly, between 15 and 20% of adults with a chronic condition reported frequently having received con\ufb02icting information from different providers.\nIt is noteworthy that failings in care coordination were observed not only in countries traditionally characterized by fragmentation, such as the United States, Australia and Germany, but also in those that are known to have strong primary care such as the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nThese countries have a strict gatekeeping system in place, which is often viewed as a mechanism to promote coordination and integration (Star\ufb01eld et al. 2005; Calnan et al. 2006). Yet, as the \ufb01ndings of Schoen et al. (2007) indicate, this is not necessarily the case and indeed, as Star\ufb01eld et al. (2005) have pointed out, \u201c[v]ery few health systems, even those that rate high on primary care, achieve high coordination of care\u201d. Therefore, problems in achieving coordination and integration of services along the entire care continuum abound in most healthcare settings. The next section explores some of the reasons why.\nOvercoming the challenges Problems of care coordination and integration typically arise at the interfaces between primary and secondary care, health and social care, curative and public health services, and among specialities and professional groups (Boerma 2006), although much of the available evidence relates to the interface between health and social care. To simplify the discussion, we here use notions of inte-gration, coordination, joint or partnership working and related concepts syn-onymously while recognizing that, in practice, they may not necessarily be identical (Chapter 4).\nIn an analysis of the United Kingdom experience integrating health and social services in the late 1990s, Hardy et al. (1999) identi\ufb01ed a number of major barriers to integration. These include: \u2022 structural barriers caused by fragmentation of responsibilities across boundaries between agencies, both within and between sectors \u2022 procedural barriers arising from differences in planning and budgetary horizons and cycles and information systems and protocols \u2022 \ufb01nancial barriers caused by differences in funding mechanisms and sources and in allocation and \ufb02ows of \ufb01nancial resources \u2022 professional barriers arising from competing ideologies and values, profes-sional self-interest and autonomy, interprofessional competition for domains, threats to job security and potentially con\ufb02icting views about service users\u2019 interests and roles (Chapter 7) \u2022 status and legitimacy barriers as re\ufb02ected by organizational self-interest and the desire for autonomy.\nSimilarly, commenting on partnership working in health and social care, Glasby et al. (2006) identi\ufb01ed structural divisions, separation of legal and \ufb01nancial frameworks, distinct organizational and professional cultures and differences in terms of governance and accountability as key barriers to bringing together 224 E. Nolte and M. McKee health and social services. Looking more speci\ufb01cally at coordination and inte-gration within the healthcare sector Calnan et al. (2006) identi\ufb01ed similar obstacles, in particular structural and \ufb01nancial barriers dividing providers at the primary/secondary care interface as well as professional barriers, such as \u201cprofessional rivalry\u201d between hospital doctors and general practitioners. More recently, in an analysis of continuity of care in the United Kingdom, Hardy et al.\n(2006) added frequent organizational change (\u201corganizational turbulence\u201d) as a strong impediment towards coordination of care while Plochg et al. (2006) highlighted the potential negative impact of the introduction of a compet-itive environment on the sustainability of community-based integrated care initiatives.\nFinancial concerns pose a critical challenge to many initiatives, as there is often a failure to understand that \u201cintegration costs before it pays\u201d, as Leutz (1999) commented when reviewing attempts in the United States and United Kingdom to integrate health and social services. He argued that successful inte-gration requires sustained investment in staff and support systems (such as training and information systems), funding for start-up costs, and \ufb02exibility to respond to needs that emerge during implementation. However, \u201c[f]ailure to anticipate these costs . . . is a typical shortcoming of public initiatives, which are often strapped for cash and may not recognize the new management, training and supervision models that are required\u201d.\nLeutz (1999) further observed that there is often an expectation that integra-tion initiatives will self-fund from \u201csavings\u201d arising when a new service is substituted for an existing one. This may, however, threaten the position of the existing providers, who may not wish to give up control (\u201cturf guarding\u201d). A recent review of two major research programmes on continuity of care in England and Canada also cautioned that the creation of new coordinating mechanisms will not compensate for lack of resources (Freeman et al. 2007).\nThere may be a temptation to inject one-off extra funding to pay for new ser-vices (Leutz 1999), but this will not necessarily ensure long-term sustainability, as illustrated by the example of transmural care in the Netherlands (Box 10.1), an initiative that also highlights the importance of aligning payment schemes with system objectives (Hofmarcher et al. 2007; Chapter 9).\nMany initiatives appear to rest on an implicit assumption that integration is \u201ca good thing\u201d (Goodwin et al. 2004; Glasby et al. 2006). Yet the evidence that this is so is scarce; questions remain as to whether such arrangements \u201creally lead to better services and better outcomes\u201d, and if so, under what circum-stances and how (Glasby et al. 2006). For example, reviewing the evidence on \u201csuccess\u201d, de\ufb01ned as having generated bene\ufb01cial changes in processes and/or outcomes of partnership working (or, by extension, cooperation) across health and social care in the United Kingdom, Dowling et al. (2004) found that most research focused on process measures, typically relating to the functioning of partnerships. In contrast, evidence about whether or how partnerships improve outcomes, for example by enhancing access to services or improving ef\ufb01ciency, effectiveness or quality of services, was inconsistent or inconclusive.\nThe authors concluded that \u201cresearch that brings together rigorous and system-atic evidence of the outcomes, causality and costs of partnerships has yet to be conducted\u201d (Dowling et al. 2004).\nMaking it happen 225 A recent Cochrane review of shared care arrangements at the interface between primary and speciality care in chronic disease management failed to identify suf\ufb01cient evidence of signi\ufb01cant improvements in patient outcomes, with the possible exception of improved prescribing (Smith et al. 2007). The de\ufb01nition of shared care as \u201cthe joint participation of primary care physi-cians and specialty care physicians in the planned delivery of care\u201d in that review does not exactly match the de\ufb01nition of partnership/joint working described above. However, taken together, these \ufb01ndings highlight the con-tinued dif\ufb01culty in drawing \ufb01rm and consistent conclusions about the impact of coordination and integration on outcomes from the available evidence (Chapter 4).\nIt is also important to note that the often assumed ability of efforts at integra-tion to overcome fragmentation may not be justi\ufb01ed. Fabbricotti (2007) found that some forms of integration may, paradoxically, lead to (further) fragmenta-tion. Analysing the formation of integrated delivery systems in the Netherlands, she showed that multidisciplinary teams and case management strategies did increase the alignment of activities by professionals in different organizations but they also decreased opportunities for professionals to coordinate with those monodisciplinary colleagues that remained outside teams. Imbalances of power Box 10.1 Transmural care in the Netherlands Improving the continuity and quality of care for people with long-term conditions by closing the gap between primary and hospital services has been a major objective in Dutch health policy since the 1990s, giving rise to the concept of transmural care (van der Linden et al. 2001). Transmural care has been de\ufb01ned as \u201ccare, attuned to the needs of the patient, pro-vided on the basis of cooperation and coordination between general and specialized caregivers with shared overall responsibility and the speci\ufb01cation of delegated responsibilities\u201d (van der Linden et al. 2001).\nThis approach has subsequently been developed extensively, with an estimated 500+ initiatives by the end of the 1990s. Most forms of transmu-ral care focus on managing the interface between acute hospital care and alternative settings for those who are not able to return to a fully independent life.\nArrangements are often based on contracts or may be informal. In a few cases, cooperating organizations eventually merged (van der Linden et al.\n2001; den Exter et al. 2004). A key challenge has been the provision of suf\ufb01cient funding in the absence of established \ufb01nancial mechanisms.\nMany transmural care projects receive grants or subsidies from the local or national government (den Exter et al. 2004). Hospitals may spend up to 3% of their budget on transmural care activities, yet many initiatives have found it dif\ufb01cult to generate additional sources of funding or to restructure their \ufb01nancial mechanisms to cater for the new arrangements (van der Linden et al. 2001).\n226 E. Nolte and M. McKee and resources within the integrated delivery system may cause initiatives to \u201cback\ufb01re\u201d as individuals strive to retain their \ufb01nancial and strategic position.\nThus, \u201c[p]rocesses of integration and fragmentation take place simultaneously, leading to continually changing and different IDS [integrated delivery systems] structures and alliances between actors\u201d (Fabbricotti 2007).\nAs these examples show, the available evidence from research provides only limited support for the intuitive belief in the potential of integration to solve many problems. This must be born in mind when looking at the practical experience. The next section explores experiences in a range of countries, focus-ing, in particular, on how policy makers have sought to establish a policy framework that allows for the development and implementation of coordinated and/or structured approaches to chronic care, thereby, directly or indirectly, overcoming the barriers to integration identi\ufb01ed above.\nAnalysing response in different countries Re\ufb02ecting on options to advance the quality of chronic care, Epping-Jordan et al. (2004) noted that \u201cimprovement in the care of patients with chronic illness will only occur if the system leaders . . . make it a priority and provide the leadership, incentives and resources necessary to make improvements happen\u201d.\nWe here explore whether and how policy makers in different countries have succeeded in this goal.\nIn many countries, innovative approaches to chronic care are still experi-mental, with limited evidence of their effectiveness. Few have been adequately documented, although the accompanying volume does provide considerable new information (Nolte et al. 2008). Consequently, the selection of countries reviewed is of necessity pragmatic; they do, however, include a mix of countries with different approaches to funding healthcare that have demonstrated some degree of innovation in chronic care. These are Denmark, England, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Sweden, with the addition of Canada and Australia from outside the European region as these can nevertheless provide useful les-sons for Europe. Given the range of approaches adopted in different countries, the analysis inevitably has to be selective, highlighting only key issues; more detailed descriptions can be found in Nolte et al. (2008).\nNew approaches to chronic care Health system responses to chronic disease vary widely, re\ufb02ecting, to a great extent, national approaches to health system governance and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the regulation, funding and delivery of healthcare. The nature and scope of policies on chronic disease are very diverse, with some countries having developed nationally integrated strategies spanning the con-tinuum from health promotion and disease prevention to the management of complex conditions. These include Australia, Denmark and England. Others have implemented a spectrum of parallel policies targeting speci\ufb01c elements along the care continuum (e.g. France, Germany, the Netherlands and some Making it happen 227 places in Canada and Sweden). The following section brie\ufb02y summarizes some of the key components of these policies.\nResponsibility for health policy in Australia is shared by the Common-wealth government and those of the states and territories. Strategies to address chronic disease have focused on quality of care and on reducing resource use (Glasgow et al. 2008). The Commonwealth government\u2019s policies include the 2005 National Chronic Disease Strategy, which provides an \u201coverarching frame-work of national direction for improving chronic disease prevention and care across Australia\u201d, along with \ufb01ve supporting National Service Improvement Frameworks covering a range of chronic conditions (National Health Priority Action Council 2005). The subsequent 2006 Better Health Initiative, Better Health for all Australians, a joint venture from the Australian state and territory governments was designed to reduce the impact of chronic disease through health promotion and early detection and to encourage self-management and improving care coordination (Council of Australian Governments 2006).\nThe Enhanced Primary Care scheme, a system of \ufb01nancial incentives for general practitioners introduced in 1999, encourages coordination of care for patients with chronic conditions with pay-for-performance linked to care quality (Healy et al. 2006; Glasgow et al. 2008; Chapter 9).\nThe federal division of responsibility in Australia means that implementation of policies depends, to a great extent, on the individual states, whose prime focus tends to be on decreasing the use of hospital resources by reducing admis-sions, readmissions and length of stay. State responses are numerous and diverse, including, for example, the New South Wales chronic care programme (NSW Department of Health 2004a, 2004b) and the Northern Territory prevent-able chronic disease strategy (Weeramanthri et al. 2003). Consequently, it has been argued that, despite the existence of a nationally agreed vision in the form of the Better Health Initiative, the momentum for a common national approach has been lost (Glasgow et al. 2008).\nDenmark has also developed a national vision of chronic disease control with the government\u2019s 2002 Healthy throughout Life strategy, which focuses on major preventable diseases and disorders, setting targets to increase life expect-ancy, improve quality of life and minimize health inequalities (Ministry of the Interior and Health 2003). The strategy was brought into operation in a project by the National Board of Health (2005), followed by a report setting out options for improving the care for those with chronic conditions (National Board of Health 2006). Many of the options proposed are in the form of general recommendations although some are more speci\ufb01c.\nImproving care coordination was also an important driver behind the recent structural reform of the Danish health system, which involved reallocation of responsibilities in the healthcare sector between \ufb01ve newly established Danish regions (replacing the previous 14 county councils) and the municipalities (Strandberg-Larsen et al. 2007). As part of the reform, municipal health centres are being developed and evaluated, targeting primarily elderly people and those with chronic health problems (Schiotz et al. 2008). However, the initiative has been criticized as lacking a coherent framework and, importantly, the new centres are limited to provision of non-physician services (M\u00f8ller Pedersen 2006).\nAs in Denmark, in England the 2004 White Paper Choosing Health set out a 228 E. Nolte and M. McKee broad strategy to improve population health, encompassing health promotion, disease prevention and initiatives designed to improve the care of those with chronic disease (Department of Health 2004a). It built on a series of National Service Frameworks, long-term strategies for improving care in speci\ufb01c areas (e.g. diabetes, cancer, mental health, children, older people, long-term neuro-logical conditions) and the 2004 National Health Service Improvement Plan (Department of Health 2004b), which set out a systematic approach to support-ing patients with chronic conditions. Strategies included the implementation of case management in all primary care trusts, bodies that are responsible for pur-chasing care for geographically de\ufb01ned populations on the basis of health need.\nThe 2005 NHS and Social Care Model sets out a comprehensive strategy for improving the care of those with chronic conditions, based on risk strati\ufb01cation to match services to need, case management and establishment of new multi-disciplinary teams (Department of Health 2005). The 2006 White Paper Our Health, Our Care, Our Say set out the government\u2019s vision for community-based care to support elderly people and those with chronic conditions (Department of Health 2006). Key drivers of these policies were the quest for improvement in the quality and accessibility of care for those with chronic disease and the con-tainment or reduction of costs. There is a speci\ufb01c government target to reduce inpatient emergency bed-days by 5% by March 2008, to be achieved, mainly, through the provision of personal care plans for vulnerable people at most risk.\nThe primary care team plays a crucial role in these reforms. Consequently, a new system of paying for primary care has been introduced, which provides \ufb01nancial incentives to encourage general practices to provide high-quality care for selected chronic conditions (Roland 2004), an incentive scheme in which most practices have exceeded expectations (Cole 2005; Chapter 9).\nIn contrast, no overarching national chronic disease strategies have emerged in France, Germany and the Netherlands, but there has been a spectrum of parallel policies targeting speci\ufb01c elements of the care continuum. This re\ufb02ects, to some extent, the diverse responsibilities for funding healthcare through (social) health insurance and, in Germany and the Netherlands, the decentralized nature of decision making, involving a range of actors including representatives of the health professions and insurers.\nIn the French healthcare system, concern about a lack of coordination and continuity of care, both in the ambulatory sector and on the interface between ambulatory and hospital care, has prompted a series of changes (Sandier et al.\n2004). These include, in 1996, the introduction of mechanisms stimulating experiments with different provider networks at the local level, with initiatives eventually formalized as \u201chealth networks\u201d (R\u00e9seaux de Sant\u00e9) in the 2002 Patients\u2019 Rights and Quality of Care Act (Frossard et al. 2002). This was followed by the 2004 Public Health Law, which de\ufb01ned a series of health targets for (chronic) diseases and risk factors for the period 2005\u20132009 and foresaw the development of a national public health plan for people with chronic illness, published in 2007 (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Solidarit\u00e9s 2007), and the 2004 Health Insurance Law, which, among other things, reformed the traditional ALD (affections de longue dur\u00e9e) procedure that exempts patients with long-term conditions from co-payments if their care adheres to evidence-based guidelines (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008). It has been argued that these initiatives lack an integrative vision, Making it happen 229 with no clearly de\ufb01ned objectives, procedures for implementation, or incentives and sanctions; however, there is an expectation that the 2007 national plan will be an important step towards a more coherent approach to chronic care.\nAs in France, there is growing concern in Germany about the ability to sup-port patients with complex needs in a system that until recently was character-ized by a strict separation between the hospital and ambulatory sector, and this has led to a series of initiatives targeting different actors in the healthcare sys-tem (Hilfer et al. 2007). In 1993, provisions were introduced to support more integrated models of care, followed by the creation of disease management programmes in 2002 (Busse 2004). In 2004, integrated care obtained further support from the removal of certain legal and \ufb01nancial obstacles by means of the Social Health Insurance Modernization Act. This effectively established integrated care as a distinct sector, enabling health insurance funds to designate \ufb01nancial resources for selective contracting with single providers or network of providers, many of which targeting the interface between acute hospital and rehabilitative care (Busse and Riesberg 2004).\nThe German disease management programmes have attracted considerable international attention. They are highly structured and regulated and embed-ded in the social health insurance system. They involve a change in the risk structure compensation scheme that creates strong incentives for sickness funds to enrol patients (Siering 2008). The funding system also creates considerable \ufb01nancial incentives for physicians to participate in the scheme. Existing pro-grammes cover diabetes type 1 and 2, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and breast cancer. Although disease management pro-grammes are now an integral component of the German healthcare sector, some have questioned their effectiveness and the appropriateness of the \ufb01nancial incentives involved (Gerst and Korzilius 2005).\nSimilar concerns about continuity and quality of care for people with long-term conditions, especially where their needs straddle the interface between primary and secondary care, has also been a concern in the Netherlands. This gave rise to the concept of transmural care in the early 1990s (van der Linden et al. 2001), described in Box 10.1. This has been compared with the \u201cshared care\u201d approaches seen in the United Kingdom (Vondeling 2004). More recently, there has been interest in the development of disease management approaches that support integration of processes along the care pathway for those with chronic conditions (Vrijhoef et al. 2001). Previously, these had attracted some, but limited, interest and, in the early 2000s, approximately 10% of general prac-titioners in the Netherlands were engaged in some form of disease management (Steuten et al. 2002). It has been argued that an expansion of such programmes was hindered by a lack of a structured framework for implementation and evaluation (Klein-Lankhorst and Spreeuwenberg 2008). However, the 2006 healthcare reform, in which many new market-based elements were introduced, has been interpreted by some as providing potential opportunities to improve care for chronic disease by enabling consumer groups (\u201ccollectives\u201d) to negoti-ate group insurance contracts for their members. Thus, a health insurance fund could develop a plan speci\ufb01cally catering for the needs of patients with speci\ufb01c conditions. However, this has so far attracted little interest (Bartholom\u00e9e and Maarse 2007).\n230 E. Nolte and M. McKee The healthcare systems in Canada and Sweden both devolve considerable responsibilities to the provinces and territories and the counties, respectively. In Canada, in 2002, the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health developed an integrated Pan-Canadian Healthy Living Strategy, focusing on the prevention of chronic disease (Jiwani and Dubois 2008). The strategy re\ufb02ects the division of responsibilities. Public health is a federal responsibility whereas responsibility for healthcare (within a federal legal framework) lies with the provinces. Consequently, there is considerable diversity in what is happening on the ground, with several provinces developing innovative schemes aimed at care coordination through shared governance of a broad range of health ser-vices and increased collaboration among health providers. Examples include Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. In Ontario, there is a Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Framework, which provides a framework for the activities of family health teams, which were created in 2004, and the more recently established (2005) Local Health Integration Networks. The latter are local governance structures mandated to plan, coordinate and fund local health services within speci\ufb01ed geographic areas. Many have identi\ufb01ed chronic disease prevention and management as a priority (Jiwani and Dubois 2008). In Quebec, initiatives to enhance chronic care have been embedded in an overall strategy to improve health and social care within available resources. This has involved the creation of local services networks (health and social services centres) which bring together all care providers in a region to develop partner-ships of relevant groups (such as physicians and community organizations).\nThese are tasked with ensuring provision of a comprehensive basket of services stretching from prevention to end-of-life care.\nIn Sweden, the primary care centre is seen as the foundation for chronic care, guided by regional and local guidelines. Nurses play an increasingly prominent role, taking on advanced care of patients with chronic and complex conditions such as diabetes and asthma, for whom they have limited rights to prescribe (Karlberg 2008). By the late 1990s, two-thirds of hospitals had nurse-led heart failure clinics, based on clinical protocols, with nurses empowered to change medication regimens within the protocols (Stromberg et al. 2001). However, there has been considerable debate in Sweden about the challenges of coordin-ation between providers. This has led to the development of so-called \u201cchains of care\u201d (Andersson and Karlberg 2000), de\ufb01ned as \u201ccoordinated activities within healthcare\u201d often involving \u201cseveral responsible authorities and medical providers\u201d (Ahgren 2003), and comparable to managed clinical networks for speci\ufb01c patient groups that work to common guidelines and agreements (Karlberg 2008). By 2002, most county councils had established at least one chain of care, most focusing on patients with chronic conditions such as dia-betes, dementia and rheumatoid disorders. The main driver of these initiatives was the quest to improve quality of care; although success has been mixed, there appears to be a strong motivation among county councils to continue and extend this approach (Ahgren 2003). Since 2005, there has also been a move-ment to develop local coordinating strategies at county level, under the heading \u201clocal healthcare\u201d (narsjukvard). This has been de\ufb01ned as \u201can upgraded family-and community-oriented primary care [system] supported by a \ufb02exible hospital system\u201d (Ahgren and Axelsson 2007). Taken together, these developments seek Making it happen 231 to strengthen links between local providers, especially in relation to elderly people and those with mental disorders such as dementia. Although the chains of care and local healthcare strategies have evolved on essentially parallel tracks, they are being linked in several places (Karlberg 2008). There is an expectation that the newly formed Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions may enhance coordination at the local and regional level.\nIn summary, there are many strategies being implemented in different coun-tries to address chronic disease, with different systems at different stages of the process and with different degrees of comprehensiveness. For example, they vary in the extent to which they span the spectrum from prevention to palliation, or whether they concentrate on only a small part of that spectrum. It is, however, important to note how most of these countries have made chronic care a priority. The next section will explore whether this prioritization has been matched by appropriate investment.\nSupporting the development and implementation of new approaches to chronic care The evidence reviewed in this volume and in the accompanying one highlight several broad areas where attention is needed in the transition from the trad-itional model of fragmented care to one where the patient\u2019s journey is better coordinated. These include: \u2022 the provision of adequate \ufb01nances, both to bring about the transition, includ-ing the development of new structures and skills, and to sustain the new system \u2022 the creation of an appropriately trained and motivated workforce, imbued with an acceptance of the value of joint working \u2022 information technology, with systems designed to support the new app-roaches to care and built in \ufb02exibility to adapt to future changes.\nA fourth issue is the creation of systems that enable patients to self-manage effectively (Chapter 6), an issue that can only be addressed successfully if complemented by the three elements listed above.\nFinancing Several countries have, directly or indirectly, set aside considerable resources to support the development and implementation of innovative approaches to chronic care. The precise mechanism has varied, depending on the existing lines of accountability and responsibility. Targeted payments have been used where tiers of government have direct control over delivery, while more decen-tralized systems have tended to use start-up grants to support the development of new approaches, although this distinction is not clear cut.\nFor example, the Australian federal and state governments committed, in 2006, a total of AU$500 million (\u0001305 million) over \ufb01ve years to the Australian Better Health Initiative. One of its \ufb01ve priority areas supports targeted training for health professionals to assist people with chronic conditions to manage their 232 E. Nolte and M. McKee condition better. A second priority is to improve coordination of services, backed up by provision of incentive funds (Council of Australian Governments 2006). The Australian government has made available a further AU$15 million (\u00019 million) from 2006\u201307 to support additional self-management support strategies, following an earlier injection of AU$36.2 million (\u000122 million) to test different models for self-management of chronic conditions for their suitability to the Australian context (Sharing Health Care Initiative; Jordan and Osborne 2007).\nIn France, the provider health networks tasked with strengthening the coordination, integration and continuity of healthcare for those with complex needs are supported by the state and by the social health insurance funds, with a total of \u0001650 million invested between 2000 and 2005 (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008). Funds can be used to \ufb01nance networks per se (infrastructure and operating costs) or for new services. Investments have included mobile dialysis units; specialized mental health facilities; new cancer centres that combine research, treatment and prevention; and new centres for management of HIV/ AIDS (McKee and Healy 2002). By 2006, approximately 450 networks operated in France, mostly targeting patients with chronic conditions, with patients with diabetes forming a large section (although even then covering only around 5% of the diabetic population in France). The budget for the 2007 national plan on the quality of life for the chronically ill has been set at \u0001727 million for the period 2007\u201311 (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Solidarit\u00e9s 2007).\nSeveral countries have used start-up grants to support the development of new approaches to care. For example, the federal government in Canada has supported provincial initiatives through the Primary Healthcare Transition Fund (2000\u201306) (Jiwani and Dubois 2008). This has, for example, assisted the Alberta government to establish a multidisciplinary chronic disease manage-ment team in the Calgary Health Region. The Australian government has allo-cated funds within the National Primary Care Collaborative Programme to improve service delivery, access and integration of care for patients with com-plex and chronic conditions, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d to be supported by a total AU$34.5 million (\u000121 million) over four years from 2007/08. Activities in the \ufb01rst wave involved approximately 20% of general practices and included the establishment of disease registers, initiation of service and patient management plans and improved access. In Denmark, the municipal health centres have received an initial funding of 170 million Dkr (\u000122 million) for 28 experimental initiatives, with the expectation that municipalities will assume \ufb01nancial responsibility from 2008 (M\u00f8ller Pedersen 2006).\nInevitably, there is a danger that, even where evaluations have been positive, innovations will fail to attract long-term support after the start up funding has ended. Success often depends on the new approaches being incorporated into routine care, and while sustained \ufb01nancing will be a necessary requirement it may not be suf\ufb01cient, especially where the innovation challenges established ways of working (May 2006).\nSeveral countries have introduced \ufb01nancial incentives for providers and/or purchasers/payers to strengthen care coordination or implement structured dis-ease management programmes. Examples include Australia, Denmark, England, France and Germany. As demonstrated in Chapter 9, the success of these schemes Making it happen 233 has been mixed and it is important to highlight that where fee for service is the main form of payment in primary care, such as in Australia and Germany, the introduction of additional incentives has led to a high administrative burden that, at least in the Australian case, has acted as a main barrier to implementa-tion of more coordinated approaches to care in general practice (Zwar et al. 2005).\nIn Germany, the high administrative burden linked to the disease management programme has been one of the key criticisms expressed by physicians oppos-ing the programme (Siering 2008), with efforts now underway to relieve the situation (Hilfer et al. 2007).\nOther approaches to provide incentives for coordination among providers involve changes to funding mechanisms. For example, the recent structural reforms in Denmark that gave municipalities a greater role in health mean that the municipalities now have to contribute 20% to healthcare funding. This was designed to encourage municipalities to invest in health promotion and pre-ventive treatment while developing alternatives to hospital services (Ankjaer-Jensen and Christiansen 2007). However, there is a risk that this could impede coordination and may potentially lead to a duplication of services provided by municipalities and regions. In Germany, integrated care is being \ufb01nanced through a mechanism that redistributes 1% of the income of sickness funds from ambulatory and hospital care to integrated care pilots. This money can only be used for this purpose (Busse and Riesberg 2004) and, in 2006, a total of \u0001571 million was invested in integrated care pilots (Hilfer et al. 2007).\nWorkforce and capacity Chapter 7 demonstrated that human resources are central to the development and implementation of new approaches to chronic care. It also showed that, while several countries are attempting to develop new roles and competencies, few countries have a comprehensive policy framework that goes all the way from educational programmes to mechanisms to integrate new roles and com-petencies into routine practice. For example, in England, the Department of Health has put considerable effort into developing the workforce, including the development of national workforce competency frameworks (Singh and Fahey 2008). One component is the creation of the new title of community matron, intended as a case manager who can support patients with complex health needs. However, this has initially caused friction within the nursing community as the introduction of community matrons took no account of the similar roles already being undertaken in the community (Hudson 2005).\nChapter 7 also drew attention to the necessity of providing appropriate organ-izational arrangements for chronic care. It is apparent that countries where primary care has traditionally been provided by doctors, typically in single-handed practices with few support staff, face a major challenge in developing and implementing new roles and competencies. In France, for example, there are even legal barriers to rede\ufb01ning roles and delegating tasks to non-medical personnel. Consequently, it required a change in the law on professional responsibilities before hospital dieticians could assume responsibility for dia-betic education and counselling, roles previously performed by endocrin-ologists (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008). However, even where there are no 234 E. Nolte and M. McKee such restrictions, payment systems often hinder the delegation of tasks from doctors to other health professionals. For example, although the Enhanced Primary Care scheme in Australia was intended to encourage multidisciplinary care, its impact has been limited because payments for participation in many activities are limited to general practitioners (Glasgow et al. 2008). A lack of appropriate incentives has also been identi\ufb01ed as creating barriers to greater involvement by general practitioners in integrated approaches to care in Denmark and the Netherlands (Steuten et al. 2002; Schiotz et al. 2008). In France, the payment of providers on a fee-for-service basis does not encourage improved coordination between physicians and nurses (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008).\nThese structural barriers to joint working are often reinforced by professional concerns among physicians about delegating tasks in countries where nurses have traditionally played a minimal role in primary care, as in Canada (Bailey et al. 2006), Germany (Rosemann et al. 2006) and Australia (Oldroyd et al. 2003) (see Chapter 7).\nInformation technology Complex systems involving multiple professionals, working across interfaces between sectors, can only function if there are effective mechanisms to transfer information (Hofmarcher et al. 2007; Leutz 1999). Many countries are investing considerable resources in the development of electronic health records, includ-ing France, Germany and several provinces in Canada. In some cases, this is as part of a wider national strategy, such as the English National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT) launched in 2002 (House of Commons Health Committee 2007) and the Australian HealthConnect initiative (Glasgow et al. 2008), working towards the development of broad e-health platforms (Chapter 8). However, progress has been slow, and in some instances, such as in Germany, initiatives have met with substantial criticism by providers because of the costs involved (Tuffs 2007). The English initiative has been criticized for delays in implementation, inadequate safeguards against disclosure of personal data (in part re\ufb02ection of a series of cases in which of\ufb01cial data were lost by government agencies), failure to meet the needs of users and threats to patient safety arising from problems with information retrieval (Hendy et al. 2007).\nClinical information systems that link different providers remain relatively underdeveloped in most settings. Where systems have been developed, their (cost-)effectiveness has been questioned. For example, an audit of 12 health networks in France found that an investment of over \u000130 million in the devel-opment and implementation of systems of shared computerized medical records has had very limited results, with only two networks having succeeded in developing a fully operational system (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008). A recent survey among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on care coordination showed that only a few coun-tries had put policies in place to enhance information collection and transfer (Hofmarcher et al. 2007).\nThese problems are unsurprising. Challenges already begin with the seemingly simple task of booking appointments in the health system, which commentators Making it happen 235 often contrast with the relative ease of on-line booking of airline tickets on the Internet. Yet this is not a valid comparison in the area of chronic disease. Airline websites make it easy to book single journeys, analogous to an acute episode of care. They are much less useful for the traveller seeking to follow a complex journey through many different cities (analogous to a patient with a chronic disease), and even if the passenger succeeds in getting a ticket there is no guar-antee that he or she will make all the connections, and even less that their luggage will follow them to their ultimate destination. The demands on infor-mation systems designed to support chronic disease management are an order of magnitude more complicated than many of those used to support simple commercial transactions. The dif\ufb01culties are compounded with increasingly mobile populations, a growing number of whom may be receiving care in dif-ferent countries. With the possible exception of some localized small-scale projects, existing clinical information systems do not seem to be up to the challenge.\nEvaluation This volume demonstrates clearly how all countries are facing similar challenges in responding to chronic disease yet none have fully satisfactory solutions.\nThere is a critical need to facilitate sharing of experiences, so that countries can learn from each other. This book and the companion volume seek to support this process. Yet reviews such as these can only re\ufb02ect the available evidence of what works and what does not. It will be apparent to the reader that the expend-iture of many millions of euros on innovative approaches to chronic disease management has not been matched by a corresponding effort to evaluate them.\nThere are, however, a few exceptions. In Australia, all programmes imple-mented by the federal government are formally evaluated for appropriateness, effectiveness and ef\ufb01ciency, usually by contractors independent of government (Glasgow et al. 2008). These evaluations are designed to inform the government whether or not programmes should be continued (although they do not deter-mine what the decision will be; Box 10.2). In Germany, the legislation enabling the creation of disease management programmes included a statutory require-ment that sickness funds would evaluate them to ensure that the programmes complied with the criteria for funding and their goals were being achieved (Siering 2008). Evaluation has to be undertaken by independent contractors, working to methodological speci\ufb01cations established by the Federal Insurance Of\ufb01ce, which accredits disease management programmes. However, these evalu-ations are limited in scope (Hilfer et al. 2007) and, recognizing their shortcom-ings, one large sickness fund has commissioned a scienti\ufb01c evaluation that will compare prospectively disease management programmes with usual care (Joos et al. 2005).\nInitiatives to improve care of those with chronic diseases have also been evalu-ated in Denmark. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme, initially developed in the United States (Chapter 6) to use lay trainers to help patients to develop the necessary skills to coordinate the various elements of their care, was piloted in two sites to ascertain whether it would translate to the Danish context (Schiotz et al. 2008) (the programme was also tested for appropriateness in 236 E. Nolte and M. McKee Australia (Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing 2005) and England (Kennedy et al. 2007)). The evaluation was positive, achieving similar results to those in the United States, and the Danish government now works towards rolling the programme out nationally, with the regions to establish a network to ensure the quality of the programme (National Board of Health 2006).\nAlthough the English National Health Service has a large research and develop-ment programme, including a Service Delivery and Organization programme, the scale and speed of new initiatives has made it dif\ufb01cult to keep pace with them (Singh and Fahey 2008). In some instances, pilot initiatives have been rolled out before evidence from evaluations was available, illustrated by the example of case management, introduced in nine pilot projects in 2003 but rapidly adopted as national strategy (Department of Health 2004b) (Chapter 4).\nA subsequent evaluation of the pilots did not \ufb01nd evidence that they had reduced emergency admissions, one of the key goals (Gravelle et al. 2007).\nIn France there has been less evaluation, although health networks are subject to regular external audit every three years (Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008).\nThe regional health authorities paying for the networks are entitled to dis-continue funding if the audits produce adverse \ufb01ndings (Box 10.3). Other care systems are not being evaluated on a systematic basis, which is also the case in Box 10.2 Evaluating the Australian Asthma 3+ Visit Plan The Asthma 3+ Visit Plan formed part of the Australian asthma manage-ment plan. It incorporated \ufb01nancial incentives for general practitioners, with payments claimable if the patient had had at least three asthma-related consultations over four weeks to four months. Consultations had to cover diagnosis and assessment of severity, review of asthma-related medication, provision of a written asthma action plan and education of the patient. It was evaluated at local and national level by researchers independent of government, using multiple methods including eliciting views from general practitioners (survey) and service users (interviews), analysis of Medicare data and focus groups comprising both service users and providers. An additional component focused on its use among Abori-ginals and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The evaluation revealed several important issues, including dif\ufb01culties in getting people with asthma to return for all three visits and the challenges that general practi-tioners confronted when attempting to integrate the relative in\ufb02exible structure of the plan into routine practice. In response, the government launched an Asthma Cycle of Care initiative (from 1 November 2006), reducing the number of visits to two and increasing the time permitted to complete the cycle to one year while maintaining the content of the Asthma 3+ Visit Plan. Yet, despite these modi\ufb01cations, there has been little change in the take-up of this approach, indicating the importance of other barriers to changing practice. (Adapted from Glasgow et al. 2008.) Making it happen 237 Germany where, except for the statutory requirement of evaluation disease management programmes, there is no systematic approach to evaluate other forms of care targeted at those with chronic illness.\nMoving forward This chapter has identi\ufb01ed three key elements that ought to be in place for an effective response to chronic disease. These are sustained \ufb01nancing, skilled and motivated health professionals, and supportive information systems. Yet, on their own, these are not suf\ufb01cient. Given the limited successes so far, this \ufb01nal section must be somewhat speculative. Nonetheless, it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions about what is needed.\nFirst, there is a need to recognize that there is a problem that requires action.\nThe complexity of chronic diseases and the potential responses to them mean that solutions will not emerge spontaneously. Those with oversight of the health system, whether they are health ministries, regional authorities, sickness funds or provider networks, often working together, must take charge to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to recon\ufb01gure organizational structures, remove barriers to change and invest in training and information technology.\nThey must also ensure that the responses are comprehensive, consistent and contextually appropriate. This volume has provided several examples of ideas that, in themselves, might have been expected to bring bene\ufb01ts but achieved less than they might have because they failed to take account of the context in which they were being implemented or they were not coordinated with other initiatives.\nSecond, there is a need to ensure that payment systems encourage rather than discourage coordination. In some countries, a quest for apparent \u201cef\ufb01ciency\u201d or reduction in waiting lists has stimulated the introduction of payment based on activity. Examples include the use of diagnosis-related groups in Germany and the so-called \u201cpayment by results\u201d policy in England, both of which encourage Box 10.3 Auditing health networks in France In its 2006 report on health networks, the ministerial audit group respon-sible for health and social affairs noted that the agencies funding the networks (the state and social health insurance funds) had failed to act on the networks\u2019 internal audits or to request in-depth evaluations where there was cause for concern. It found no tangible evidence of improved coordination of the work of of\ufb01ce-based and hospital-based physicians and other health professionals. New management tools, such as electronic medical records and decision support systems, were mostly viewed as not sustainable. The cost of networks was considered high (\u0001500 million) in relation to the results obtained. Yet, despite these \ufb01ndings, there is an expectation that the networks will ultimately lead to improvements.\n(From Durand-Zaleski and Obrecht 2008.) 238 E. Nolte and M. McKee the repeated admission of patients to hospital, precisely the opposite of what is desirable for the optimal management of chronic disease.\nThird, there is a great need to learn from the many experiences across Europe.\nIn particular, there is a need to understand not only what works but also what works in what circumstances. In other words, what are the structural, organiza-tional and cultural prerequisites for success. It cannot be assumed that something that works in one setting, where there may already be consensus of the value of multidisciplinary working, will work in another.\nThere are also some questions that those in charge might ask themselves. One relates to the balance, in a particular country, between centrally de\ufb01ned requirements and local autonomy. Given the system of accountability linking the centre and periphery, what is the best way to bring about change? The answer will depend on the national context. The creation of a strict national regulatory framework in Germany has been viewed as bene\ufb01cial in ensuring that disease management programmes meet an appropriate standard but it has also been criticized for inhibiting further improvements in response to local circumstances (Siering 2008). In contrast, and somewhat unusually given the otherwise highly centralized nature of the system, the lack of \u201cregulation\u201d in England has been seen as contributing to the considerable local variation that exists (Singh and Fahey 2008). A related issue is the balance between top-down versus bottom-up approaches. Ham (2003) has highlighted how competing pressures on organizations arising from policies initiated by healthcare reform-ers on one hand and established ways of delivery, on the other, are likely to result in a gap between policy intent and actual implementation. A critical role is to be played by professionals, who exert a large degree of control in healthcare organizations such as primary care practices and hospitals. Failure to engage them in the reform process is likely to hamper sustainable change. Indeed, as work on \u201cchains of care\u201d in Sweden has demonstrated, approaches that engaged professionals, or were indeed initiated by professionals themselves, succeeded in developing improved interorganizational and interprofessional coordinated structures while those initiated top-down by councils did not (Ahgren and Axelsson 2007). However, a supportive policy environment was also found to be critical for success.\nAnother question is whether it will actually be possible to implement change in the existing system or will it require fundamental reform, especially where there are major structural barriers to collaboration (Plochg and Klazinga 2002).\nGlasgow et al. (2008) noted, \u201c[t]he Australian government together with the State and Territory governments have made a substantial \ufb01nancial commitment to realising improved chronic disease and mental health outcomes . . . The reforms planned are incremental rather than radical and the fundamental div-ision of responsibilities in healthcare between the federal and state govern-ments looks likely to remain. The jury is out on whether these reforms will be able to be carried through and will be suf\ufb01cient to respond to the challenge of chronic disease.\u201d The German disease management programmes involve a \ufb01nancing system that is a departure from the existing payment mechanisms in the social insurance system. However, does this call these existing mechanisms into question?\nA related question is whether restructuring undertaken for other reasons will Making it happen 239 make the response to chronic disease easier or more dif\ufb01cult. In Denmark, recent administrative reforms are seen as providing an opportunity to improve coordination, although several commentators noted that it could potentially increase resource use (Ankjaer-Jensen and Christiansen 2007; Strandberg-Larsen et al. 2007). Similarly, recent reforms in the Netherlands, introducing greater competition, have been seen by some as offering the possibility of implement-ing more integrated approaches while others suggest that they may make it more dif\ufb01cult (Custers et al. 2007). In England, the relentless pace of reorganiza-tion of the National Health Service is viewed as having impeded initiatives to coordinate care (Hardy et al. 2006).\nConclusions The increased burden of complex chronic diseases, coupled with the growing clinical and organizational opportunities to manage them, poses the greatest challenge to health policy makers over the coming decades. It is no longer possible to muddle through, hoping that appropriate responses will somehow emerge. Instead, it is necessary to understand the nature of changing health needs, to design an effective response, to implement it and, recognizing the fact that nothing stands still, to monitor and reassess. Success is not impossible, but the dif\ufb01culties should not be underestimated. A \ufb01rst step is to recognize that something must be done. A second, which we hope will be facilitated by the evidence provided in this book, is to realize that something actually can be done, and that they can do it.\nReferences Ahgren, B.

We performed a scoping review to identify studies examining financial burden (patient/family healthcare expenditures), financial distress (material, behavioral, and psychological consequences of financial burden), and financial toxicity (adverse health outcomes of financial distress) experienced by patients with chronic liver disease and their families.\n\n### Methods:\n\nWe searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science online databases for articles published since the introduction of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score for liver transplant allocation in February 2002 until July 2021. Final searches were conducted between June and July 2021. Studies were included if they examined the prevalence or impact of financial burden or distress among patients with chronic liver disease and/or their caregivers.\n\n### Results:\n\nA total of 19 observational studies met inclusion criteria involving 24,549 patients and 276 caregivers across 5 countries. High rates of financial burden and distress were reported within the study populations, particularly among patients with hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant recipients. Financial burden and distress were associated with increased pre- and post-transplant healthcare utilization and poor health-related quality of life as well as caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety. None of the included studies evaluated interventions to alleviate financial burden and distress.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nObservational evidence supports the finding that financial burden and distress are underrecognized but highly prevalent among patients with chronic liver disease and their caregivers and are associated with poor health outcomes. There is a critical need for interventions to mitigate financial burden and distress and reduce financial toxicity in chronic liver disease care.\n\n**Keywords:** Financial distress, financial toxicity, financial hardship, end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis, palliative hepatology\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n-------------\n\nThe global burden of chronic liver disease is rising, affecting over 1.5 billion individuals worldwide.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R1) In Europe, liver disease is now the second leading cause of years of working life lost, following ischemic heart disease.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R2) In the United States, there have been rising rates of cirrhosis-related hospitalizations and consequent annual healthcare costs over the past two decades, outpacing those for patients with congestive heart failure.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R3),[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4)\n\nDespite the growing recognition of the increasing economic burden of chronic liver disease globally, we lack a comprehensive understanding of its financial impact on patients and their families. While there has been an increasing recognition of the financial impact of cancer[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R5) and cardiovascular disease[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R6) on patients and their families, we currently lack an understanding of the costs experienced by patients with chronic liver disease and their families across the following domains:\n\n*   Financial burden: Patient and family income consumed by healthcare costs[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R7)\u2013[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R9)\n\n*   Financial distress: Material, behavioral, and psychological consequences of financial burden[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R7)\u2013[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R11)\n\n*   Financial toxicity: Adverse health outcomes of financial distress[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R5),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R8),[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R12)\n\nTo address this gap, we performed a scoping review of the financial impact of chronic liver disease on patients and families to broadly explore key concepts and available evidence on this topic.[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R13) Our specific scoping review objectives were to (1) identify the types of financial burden and distress experienced by patients with chronic liver disease and their family caregivers; (2) identify risk factors for financial burden and distress; and (3) describe financial toxicity outcomes in this population. We conclude by proposing a conceptual framework characterizing domains of financial burden, distress and toxicity in chronic liver disease care to guide future research, intervention development, and clinical-, policy-, and system-level changes needed to address current gaps in care.\n\nMETHODS:\n--------\n\n### Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection\n\nTo be included in the review, studies needed to examine the prevalence or impact of financial burden and/or distress among patients with chronic liver disease and/or their caregivers. Definitions of financial burden and financial distress were informed by review of the oncology and cardiology literature.[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R6)\u2013[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R8),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R10),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R14) Financial burden measures included both direct (healthcare expenditures) and indirect (wage loss) financial burden. Measures of direct financial burden included objective measures such as out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures and subjective measures such as patient- and caregiver-reported difficulty paying medical bills. Measures of indirect financial burden included work loss, absenteeism, and costs of caregiving due to chronic liver disease care. Financial distress measures were classified in three broad domains: (1) material consequences of the costs of chronic liver disease care such as loss of savings, medical debt, and bankruptcy; (2) behavioral coping strategies to manage financial burden including support-seeking and making tradeoffs between medical care and paying for necessities including healthcare; and (3) psychological worry or distress due to financial burden ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#F1)).\n\n#### Figure 1:\n\n![Image 9: Figure 1:](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0b48/9669101/9e560f5f39e3/nihms-1811873-f0001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/figure/F1/)\n\nDomains of Financial Burden and Distress in Chronic Liver Disease Care.\n\nStudies were included if they were: (1) peer-reviewed original research; (2) written in English; (3) available in full-text; and (4) involved adult (\u2265 18 years old) individuals with chronic liver disease or their caregivers. We included quantitative and mixed-methods studies to examine different methods of assessing financial hardship in this population. Studies were excluded if they did not report patient- or caregiver-level quantitative data on financial burden or distress.\n\n### Information Sources and Search Strategy\n\nWith the support of one research librarian (LP), we searched the following online databases to identify potentially relevant manuscripts: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. We limited our search to articles published since the introduction of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for liver transplant allocation in February 2002 until July 2021. In addition, we manually examined the citation list of any relevant studies and reviews to identify additional eligible studies. Final searches were conducted between June and July 2021. References were sorted and evaluated for inclusion using the Rayyan application.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R15) The search terms and strategy for each database are available in [Appendix A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#APP1).\n\n### Study Selection and Data Abstraction\n\nAfter removal of duplicate citations, two independent reviewers (N.N.U. and N.S.) performed title and abstract screening followed by full-text review to identify potentially eligible studies. Interrater discrepancies for study inclusion were resolved by one additional reviewer (M.S.).\n\nWe developed a structured extraction form for study characteristics, including study objective, study design, setting and data source, eligibility criteria, participant demographics and clinical characteristics, definition or measurement of financial burden and distress, outcome measurements, and key findings. We additionally extracted reported risk factors for financial burden and distress and the association of financial burden and distress variables with patient and caregiver health outcomes (financial toxicity). The extraction form was piloted on a sample of articles and data extraction was completed independently by two reviewers (N.N.U. and N.S.) and reviewed by an additional reviewer (M.S.). All healthcare expenditure data were inflation-adjusted to the year 2021 using the United States Inflation Calculator and Bank of Canada Inflation Calculator and are reported as mean annual expenditures where appropriate.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R16),[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R17)\n\n### Conceptual Framework\n\nWe integrated the findings from our scoping review with existing models of financial burden in the oncology and cardiology literature to develop a conceptual framework for financial burden, distress, and toxicity in chronic liver disease based on currently-available evidence ([Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#F2)).[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R6)\u2013[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R11),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R14)\n\n#### Figure 2:\n\n![Image 10: Figure 2:](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0b48/9669101/27b93af3ede0/nihms-1811873-f0002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/figure/F2/)\n\n**Conceptual Framework of Financial Burden, Financial Distress, and Financial Toxicity in Chronic Liver Disease Care**. *Support-seeking includes financial coping behaviors such as crowdfunding, increased borrowing, pursuit of cost-reducing strategies for medical care, and caregivers increasing their work capacity.\n\nRESULTS\n-------\n\n### Study Selection\n\nOf 2,336 nonduplicate records screened, with 94 titles, abstracts, and/or full texts reviewed, 19 studies met the final inclusion criteria.

A total of 18 studies used structured surveys and one study used mixed-methods. Most of the studies were from the United States (n=11) followed by Canada (n=3), India (n=3), China (n=1), and Bangladesh (n=1). A few studies focused on patients with a specific etiology of chronic liver disease such as Hepatitis B (HBV) (n=1), Hepatitis C (HCV) (n=2), and alcohol-related liver disease (n=1). Five studies focused on liver transplant recipients (n=5). Three studies included data on caregivers for a total caregiver sample size of 276. Additional study information and patient and caregiver characteristics, including demographic information, are included in [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#T1).\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nCharacteristics of Included Studies\n\n| Reference | Study Description | Study Design Setting/Data Source (Subjects, n) | Study Inclusion Criteria Participant Demographics | Financial Burden and Financial Distress Measures: Definition, Prevalence | Financial Toxicity Outcomes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Lago-Hernandez et al., 2021 (USA)[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32) | To estimate the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of cost-related medication non-adherence in individuals with chronic liver disease | Cross-sectional NHIS, 2014\u20132018 (n=3,237) | Patients with chronic liver disease * 27% aged \u2265 65 y, 57% 40\u201364 y, 16% 18\u201339 y * 48% men * 67% non-Hispanic white, 18% Hispanic, 7% Black, 5% Asian * 7% uninsured | **Behavioral Financial Distress (Tradeoffs for Healthcare)**: Cost-related medication nonadherence 1.

In this study, the prevalence of financial hardship from medical bills among patients with chronic liver disease was comparable to diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.\n\n#### Indirect Financial Burden\n\n##### Worker Productivity Loss\n\nRates of unemployment among patients with chronic liver disease ranged from 44%\u221280% across six observational studies.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4),[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R26)\u2013[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R29) The 2017 study by Stepanova et al. revealed that the rate of employment among patients with chronic liver disease was substantially lower compared to non-chronic liver disease patients (45% vs. 70%, p<0.0001).[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4) In addition, patients with chronic liver disease had significantly lower work productivity due to illness and disability, reporting 3 times more disability days per year compared to controls (10.2 days vs. 3.4 days, p<0.0001).\n\nTwo studies reported unemployment rates among liver transplant recipients ranging from 36%\u221248%.[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30) In the 2011 study by Federico et al. of 47 HCV transplant recipients, mean annual time costs (time spent seeking healthcare) resulted in the equivalent of 420 hours (over 10 weeks of working time) of lost wages per patient per year.[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22) A 2017 study by Beal et al. of 12,998 liver transplant recipients using United Network for Organ Sharing data (2002\u20132009) revealed that more than 1 in 10 patients had delayed work participation until 3 years or more after their transplant.[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30)\n\n##### Time and Financial Costs of Informal Caregiving\n\nTwo studies reported out-of-pocket and time costs of informal caregiving for patients with chronic liver disease.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R21),[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22) In a U.S.-based analysis of the Health and Retirement Study (1998\u20132008) by Rakoski et al., the annual costs of informal caregiving for older individuals with cirrhosis was $4,700 USD ($5,707 in inflation-adjusted USD) per person, compared to $2,100 USD ($2,550 in inflation-adjusted USD) for age-matched individuals without cirrhosis.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R21) In the 2011 Canadian study by Federico et al., time costs of informal caregiving resulted in the equivalent of annual lost wages of $766 CAD, $1,050 CAD, and $2,460 CAD for caregivers of patients with HCV cirrhosis, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant recipients, respectively.[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22)\n\n### Financial Distress\n\n#### Material Financial Distress\n\n##### Loss of Savings/Assets\n\nIn a 2011 U.S. cross-sectional study by Bajaj et al. of 104 patients with cirrhosis and their caregivers, 54% of families reported that they were unable to add to their personal/family savings and 5% were evicted from their homes due to their medical expenses.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28) In a 2013 multicenter study by Bajaj et al. of 236 patients with cirrhosis, median liquid assets ranged from $500 - $4,999 USD ($598 - $5,983 in inflation-adjusted USD) in the patient cohort, which reduced to under $500 USD if current debt was subtracted.[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R29) In a 2007 study by Rodrigue et al. of 333 adult liver transplant recipients, 57% of patients reported that they needed to use their savings to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\n##### Medical Debt/Bankruptcy\n\nTwo studies reported a prevalence of medical debt ranging from 24%\u221246% and medical bankruptcy ranging from 7%\u22128% of the study populations.[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R24),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28)\n\n#### Behavioral Financial Distress\n\n##### Support-Seeking\n\nFive studies reported financial coping behaviors that included support-seeking behaviors such as crowdfunding[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28), increased borrowing[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R26),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31), pursuing cost-reducing strategies for prescription medications[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32), and family members having to return to work and/or increase their work hours[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31) to manage treatment expenses. In one cross-sectional study from India of 132 caregivers of patients with cirrhosis, 25% reported that they had to return to work due to increasing family financial constraints.[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31) In the 2011 study by Bajaj et al. of 104 caregivers of patients with cirrhosis, 79% of caregivers reported that they did not have any support for financial advice.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28)\n\n##### Tradeoffs for Healthcare\n\nMultiple studies reported maladaptive coping behaviors in patients with chronic liver disease and their families in response to financial burden from medical care. Three studies examined the impact of financial burden on patient engagement with medical care.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33) In the 2021 study by Lago-Hernandez et al. of a nationally representative sample of 3,237 patients with chronic liver disease in the U.S., 25% reported experiencing cost-related medication non-adherence.[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32) In this analysis, patients with chronic liver disease were significantly more likely to experience cost-related medication non-adherence compared to adults without chronic liver disease (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.22\u20131.61). A 2011 U.S. study of 104 patients by Bajaj et al. revealed that cirrhosis-related medical expenses resulted in 12% of patients missing medical appointments, 12% not taking medications, 10% taking less medications than prescribed, and 5% missing needed medical procedures.[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28) In a 2017 study by Serper et al. of 103 liver transplant recipients from two large U.S. transplant centers, 10% indicated that they could not afford their medications over the past 12 months, and 11% reported that they had to space out their medication frequency due to cost.[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33)\n\n##### Tradeoffs for Necessities\n\nFive studies examined the impact of financial burden of chronic liver disease care on patients\u2019 abilities to afford necessities such as food and housing.[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32)\u2013[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R34) In the study by Lago-Hernandez et al., patients with chronic liver disease experiencing financial burden from medical bills had significantly higher odds of food insecurity (aOR 5.6, 95% CI 3.74\u20138.37)[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25). In three studies, patients and/or caregivers reported that they had to reduce spending on their children\u2019s education in order to afford medical care.[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R26),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31)\n\n#### Psychological Financial Distress\n\nThree studies reported the prevalence of psychological financial distress among patients with chronic liver disease ranging from 36% to 63%.[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R24),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28) In the 2014\u20132018 analysis of the NHIS by Lago-Hernandez et al., 36% of U.S. patients with chronic liver disease reported high financial distress regarding their future ability to pay for medical care, housing, and monthly bills, save for retirement, and maintain their standard of living.[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25)\n\n### Risks Factors for Financial Burden and Financial Distress\n\nThirteen out of 19 (68%) manuscripts assessed risk factors associated with experiencing financial burden and financial distress.\n\nCommon socioeconomic risk factors were lack of insurance[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33), use of public insurance[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33), lower income[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R19),[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33), unemployment[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R24),[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33), lower educational attainment[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R29),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33), and lower health literacy[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33). Among liver transplant recipients, individuals who were unemployed in the year preceding their transplant were at increased risk of post-transplant unemployment and financial distress.[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30)\n\nMultiple demographic factors were associated with financial hardship and distress. Gender disparity was a common theme, with women at a greater risk of financial burden and distress[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32). Black patients were found to have higher rates of financial hardship from medical bills[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25) and were more likely to report medication trade-offs.[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33) Patients who were unmarried were less likely to be employed[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4) as were older adults[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4),[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R23),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28). Younger age was associated with increased financial hardship from medical bills and cost-related medication non-adherence[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32).\n\nClinical risk factors for financial hardship and distress were examined in multiple studies. Rates of catastrophic financial burden increased with worsening severity of disease (36% compensated cirrhosis, 51% decompensated cirrhosis) in one study of 940 patients with HBV-related disease in China.[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R19) Other clinical factors associated with an increased risk of financial hardship and/or unemployment included the presence of HCC[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R3),[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4), hepatic encephalopathy[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R9),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R14), and multimorbidity[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32),[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33). In one observational study of liver transplant recipients, an increased risk of post-transplant unemployment was seen among patients who developed acute rejection (2.17 relative risk ratio [RRR], 95% CI 1.86\u20132.54) and diabetes mellitus (1.92 RRR, 95% CI 1.67\u20132.21) after transplantation.[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R30)\n\n### Financial Toxicity in Liver Disease\n\nFive studies (26%) assessed the association between financial burden, financial distress, and healthcare outcomes. In the 2021 study by Lago-Hernandez et al., patients with chronic liver disease experiencing financial burden from medical bills had significantly higher odds unplanned emergency department visits (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.33\u20132.57).[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25) Similarly, financial distress in the form of cost-related medication non-adherence or medication tradeoffs was also associated with unplanned emergency department visits[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R32) and post-transplant hospital admissions[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R33) in two U.S.-based studies.\n\nIn the 2017 study by Stepanova et al., yearly health expenses were independently associated with a decrease (per every $10,000 USD) in the Physical Component Scores (beta, \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.09) and Mental Component Scores (beta, \u22120.25 \u00b1 0.10) on the Short-Form 12 health-related quality of life survey for patients with chronic liver disease.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R4)\n\nIn a U.S. cross-sectional study of 73 caregivers of patients with chronic liver disease, loss of income due to caregiving was associated with increased depressive symptoms, anxiety and caregiver burden.[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R35)\n\n### Conceptual Framework of Financial Burden, Distress, and Toxicity in Chronic Liver Disease\n\n[Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#F2) proposes a conceptual framework for domains of financial burden and distress that are associated with financial toxicity outcomes in adult patients with chronic liver disease and their caregivers.\n\nDISCUSSION\n----------\n\nIn this scoping review of 19 studies, we found that financial burden and distress are highly prevalent among patients with chronic liver disease and are associated with poor health outcomes for both patients and their caregivers. The prevalence of financial burden and distress in patients with chronic liver disease is comparable to rates observed in patients with other serious illnesses such as chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25) Patients with more advanced disease including those with HCC, hepatic encephalopathy, or multimorbidity were at particularly high risk, as were liver transplant recipients. Behavioral financial distress in the form reduced access and adherence to healthcare and other necessities may result in increased pre- and post-transplant healthcare utilization and poor health-related quality of life among patients with chronic liver disease. Unplanned hospital readmissions, uncontrolled illness, and progressive symptomatic disease may in turn be key manifestations of financial toxicity in this population. Despite the high rates of financial toxicity among patients with chronic liver disease, none of the included studies evaluated interventions to alleviate financial burden and distress.\n\nMultiple studies revealed that a diagnosis of chronic liver disease is financially toxic not just for patients but also for their families. The cost of chronic liver disease care resulted in food insecurity, housing instability, and loss of education, assets and savings for patients and families.[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R25),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R26),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31)\u2013[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R34) Caregivers, especially those of patients with hepatic encephalopathy, were particularly affected both in terms of out-of-pocket and time costs of family caregiving as well as changes in their employment and work productivity.[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R21),[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R22),[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R28),[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R29),[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R31) In many studies, the loss of the patient as the primary breadwinner resulted in substantial financial burden and psychological distress for caregivers, which has been described in prior qualitative studies.[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R36)\u2013[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R39) These findings underscore that interventions addressing financial burden and distress for patients with chronic liver disease must also include a holistic assessment of the needs of their family unit.\n\nAddressing financial burden and identifying financial distress in cirrhosis care will require a multilevel approach ([Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#T2)). At the physician level, increased awareness of and routine screening for financial distress may identify patients with chronic liver disease who are at risk for financial toxicity. Patients who are underinsured, unemployed, have new hepatic encephalopathy or HCC are at particularly high risk for financial burden and may merit early screening and intervention. The question \u201care you having difficulty paying for your medical care?\u201d is an effective screen for financial distress and additional tools that can be used for screening include the \u201cCosts of Care Conversations\u201d tool from the American College of Physicians and the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) survey.[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R40)\u2013[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R43) Clinicians providing care to liver transplant recipients of working age should assess whether they have returned to work and screen for work absenteeism. Additionally, during routine medication reconciliation in outpatient visits, clinicians should discuss low-cost alternatives with patients. At the clinic and hospital level, new models of care using social workers, community health workers, pharmacists and/or financial navigators to help patients and their families navigate employment benefits and family leave, access assistance for prescriptions, unemployment and nonmedical costs, and obtain financial counseling are needed.[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R44),[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R45) There should be an increasing recognition of the non-medical costs of care such as time and transportation, with consideration of telehealth visits, parking vouchers, or hospital at home models of care to alleviate these burdens on patients and their caregivers.[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R46)\u2013[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R50) Additionally, addressing cost-related barriers to care may require the development of clinic-based strategies and clinical guidelines to increase cost transparency, guide shared decision-making around cost-benefit tradeoffs, and improve delivery of high-value hepatology care.[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R51) At a policy and system level, promoting legislation for insurance coverage of high-cost medications such as immunosuppressive drugs, value-based drug-pricing, assistance programs for caregivers, and paid family and medical leave are needed.[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R52)\u2013[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R55)\n\n### Table 2.\n\nStrategies and Future Directions to Mitigate Financial Burden and Financial Distress in Chronic Liver Disease Care\n\n|  | Screening for Financial Burden and Distress | Health-System Strategies | Proposed Policy Changes and Future Directions |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Financial Burden** | **_Identify High-Risk Populations_** * Unemployed * Low socioeconomic status * Underinsured or no insurance * Limited English Proficiency * Lower educational attainment * Lower health literacy * Hepatic encephalopathy * Hepatocellular carcinoma * Multimorbidity * Liver transplant candidates/recipients | * Deprescribing * Switching to generic formulations * Discussing lower-cost alternative approaches * Early referral to co-pay and prescription drug assistance programs * Interdisciplinary collaboration with pharmacists * Telehealth and hospital-at-home care models * Transportation and parking vouchers for clinic visits * Early referral of caregivers to local and national support programs | * Expanding insurance coverage for high-cost medications in chronic liver disease care * Value-based drug pricing * Legislation to expand paid family/medical leave and informal caregiving compensation |\n| **Financial Distress** | **_Screen for Financial Distress_** * Single item: \u201cAre you having difficulty paying for your medical care?\u201d[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R40) * American College of Physicians \u201cCosts of Care Conversations\u201d tools and financial screening questions[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R42),[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R43) * Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) measure[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R41) | * Early referral to social work services * Universal screening for financial distress during clinic visits * Routine costs of care conversations when developing treatment plans | * Financial navigation and assistance programs specific to chronic liver disease * Community health workers and patient navigators to maximize social support * Comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness studies in hepatology to inform practice guidance |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/table/T2/)\n\nMore research on the financial impact of chronic liver disease on patients and caregivers is needed in four key areas. First, the current body of evidence on financial burden, distress and toxicity in chronic liver disease is predominantly from small-sample observational studies with limited outcomes assessments which are prone to biases. There is a need for large, well-typified prospective longitudinal studies assessing different domains of financial burden and distress and causal mechanisms from the time of diagnosis of chronic liver disease to the development of relevant financial and healthcare outcomes to identify risk factors. Second, methods and measures for financial burden and distress varied widely, limiting comparisons across studies. Notably, no study used a standardized instrument such as the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity survey that has been validated in the oncology population.[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R41),[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R56) Third, the included studies provided limited data on race/ethnicity, insurance status, care setting (e.g. rural, urban), or other social determinants of health of the patient and/or caregiver participants. Financial burden represents just one social determinant of health that is impacted by many upstream factors, including systemic policies, socioeconomic status, insurance access, racism, and bias.[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R57) Future research in this area should proactively recruit diverse populations with formal tracking of social determinants of health and should assess for pharmacoequity in cirrhosis care, in which all individuals, regardless of background, have access to evidence-based medications and treatments.[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R58),[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R59) Fourth, as the population of patients with chronic liver disease aged 65 years or older continues to increase, assessing risk factors for financial burden among the Medicare eligible population and outcomes related to costs of care at end-of-life will be an important area for future study.[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R60)\u2013[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9669101/#R62) Lastly, future research is needed to develop and test evidence-based interventions targeting different domains of financial burden and distress.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nObservational evidence supports the findings that financial burden and distress are highly prevalent among patients with chronic liver disease and their caregivers and are associated with poor health outcomes. Despite these findings, there is a substantial evidence gap on the measurement of patient-level financial burden and distress, causal mechanisms, and outcomes. There is a critical need for patient- and caregiver-centered interventions to alleviate financial burden and distress and reduce financial toxicity in chronic liver disease care.\n\nFunding/Support:\n----------------\n\nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Clinical, Translational and Outcomes Research Award (NNU), Massachusetts General Hospital Physician Scientist Development Award (NNU), NIH NIA 1R01AG059183 (JCL), NIDDK Undergraduate Clinical Scholars Program R25DK108711 (MS).

Executive Summary 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Every three years, the New York State (NYS) Department of Health (DOH) requires local health departments (LHD) to submit Community Health Assessments (CHA) and hospitals to submit Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA). LHDs and hospitals collaborate with community partners and residents to create Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIP) and Community Service Plans (CSP), respectively. These assessments and plans are meant to meet several requirements from NYS Public Health Law and the Affordable Care Act. In recent years, the NYSDOH has encouraged LHDs and hospitals to collaborate in the creation of these documents to better serve their communities. In 2017, the seven LHDs of the Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region), including Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester Counties, created the Local Health Department Prevention Agenda Collaborative with the goal of conducting regional resident and provider surveys, creating a regional CHA, and collaborating on common CHIP priorities. This regional approach was continued for the 2022 CHA, CHIP, and CSP cycle, with the collaborative being renamed the Hudson Valley Public Health Collaborative (HVPHC). A CHA depicts a comprehensive review of a community\u2019s current health status, factors contributing to higher health risks or poorer health outcomes, and community resources available to improve health. When conducting the Regional CHA, the HVPHC gathers data and information from as many sources as possible so that a comprehensive assessment can be completed.1 The CHA can then inform the community to make decisions and develop plans to improve the health of the region. The LHDs in the HVPHC used Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity COVID-19 funds, along with partial funding from Garnet Health to contract with Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) to conduct a regional community health survey as a component of the Regional CHA. To further supplement the data collected, members of the HVPHC held focus groups and conducted a survey of community partners to understand the needs of specific communities and populations and the barriers they face to achieving optimal health. Along with the primary data collected through the surveys and focus groups, secondary data were compiled to display health indicators for the M-H Region. Each health indicator was narrated to contextualize the data and outline how each indicator relates. This document was written by the HVPHC and is intended to serve as a reference for key health information for all stakeholders within the M-H Region and assist them in identifying and prioritizing the health needs of the region and its communities. An additional goal of this project is to initiate collaboration to address key health issues in the region and to inform the CHIPs of each county and the CSPs of non-profit 501(c)(3) hospitals. 1 Public Health Accreditation Board, 2022, https://phaboard.org/wp-content/uploads/Standards-Measures-Initial-Accreditation-Version-2022.pdf, accessed October 2022 Introduction 12 INTRODUCTION PREVENTION AGENDA The New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda (PA), developed by the NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) in 2008, is the health improvement plan for NYS, a blueprint for State and local health departments (LHDs) to improve the health of all residents. A main strategy of the NYSPA is to promote health equity across all populations who experience health disparities. Health behaviors, access to care, and social determinants of health are important factors to achieving well-being and quality of life. The 2019-2024 PA is the third cycle for the statewide initiative. The NYSPA has five priority areas with specific action plans developed for each area. The five priority areas include: Prevent Chronic Diseases; Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children; Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders; and Prevent Communicable Diseases. Since 2012, the NYSDOH has required LHDs to collaboratively work with their local hospitals and community partners in the development of the Community Health Assessment (CHA) and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT The CHA is the foundation of the essential services of local public health departments to assess and monitor population health status, factors that influence health, and community needs and assets. CHAs are conducted every three years and describe the health of a community. Data are obtained from a variety of local, state, and federal data sources to ensure a complete picture is presented. With a comprehensive review of the community\u2019s health, this data can be used to identify populations at increased risk of poor health outcomes. This document is the basis for public health planning, program development, policy change, coordination of community resources, funding applications, and new ways to collaboratively use community assets. Once completed, the information is shared with residents and community partners to start conversations and develop plans for improving health status. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN For hospitals that are considered charitable organizations, they must meet general requirements for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) and Revenue Ruling 69-545PDF. They must also meet the requirements imposed by Section 501(r) on a facility-by-facility basis in order to be treated as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3). This involves completing a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and a Community Service Plan (CSP) every three years.2 The CHNA must define the community that it serves including the geographic area, target populations, and any focus on specialty areas or targeted diseases. It must also assess the health needs of the defined community including social determinants of health. As part of this process, they should include input from partners, 2 US Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, 2022, https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/community-health-needs-assessment-for-charitable-hospital-organizations-section-501r3, accessed September 2022 Introduction 13 stakeholders, and those with knowledge of the community\u2019s health needs. As with the CHA, the CHNA should be shared widely. Through the CHNA, CHA, and partnership with the LHDs, the hospitals develop a CSP. The CSP, like the CHIP, develops and implements effective approaches to health promotion and disease prevention at the community level. The plan involves the use of evidence-based programs that target health areas identified in the CHNA that are of particular concern to their hospital service areas. For those hospitals that partner with LHDs, these areas are of concern to the greater county or regional efforts. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN The CHIP is a strategic approach to developing plans targeted to issues that were identified in the CHA. The purpose of a CHIP is to describe how the local public health system, led by the LHDs and hospitals, will work together to improve the health of their residents. The document sets priorities, identifies programs and policies that can be implemented, outlines roles and responsibilities of partners, directs use of assets, and sets strategic goals that can be measured. This is a community driven process. PARTNERSHIP The seven Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region) LHDs have vast experience with assessing health and developing partnerships to advance the health of their communities. The CHA and CHIP process allows health departments to work with a network of partners and stakeholders focused on health improvement. Collaboration ensures that this process is dynamic and evolves with what is happening to residents. Engaging the community is key to understanding, supporting, and implementing strategies and ensuring successful outcomes. HUDSON VALLEY PUBLIC HEALTH COLLABORATIVE In 2015, HealtheConnections was awarded the NYS Population Health Improvement Program (PHIP) grant for the M-H Region. The PHIP was designated to promote the triple aim of better care, better population health, and lower health care costs. They were responsible for identifying, sharing, disseminating, and helping implement best practices and strategies to promote population health and reduce health care disparities in the region. The PHIP was also tasked with supporting LHDs with the creation of projects such as CHA and CHIP planning, along with the implementation of population health interventions. In October 2015, the Local Health Department Prevention Agenda Collaborative was created to serve as a forum to share resources between the seven LHDs. The group discussed the development of a regional community survey and in November 2017 hosted a meeting with the seven LHDs, the local hospitals, health systems, and performing provider systems. The discussion included the benefits of collaboration on a regional CHA and implementation of common interventions. The group determined that this would be a successful partnership and worked together to create a regional community health survey and shared CHA that would inform the development of county CHIPs and hospital CSPs. In 2019, funding streams were no longer available to continue the work of the PHIPs. To continue the work that had been accomplished, the Hudson Valley Public Health Collaborative (HVPHC) reconvened in 2022. The HVPHC continued to meet in a less formal and regular way. The group met on an as-needed basis and generally revolved around grant opportunities and local outbreaks. Introduction 14 In April 2021 the group started meeting monthly to discuss collaboration on a regional CHA and development of another regional community survey with Siena College Research Institute. The group determined the importance of having a regional CHA and agreed to collaborate for the 2022-2024 period. As part of the process, each LHD reached out to their hospital partners to discuss interest in regional collaboration. Hospitals interested in participating in the M-H Region CHA and community survey have been included in the planning process. EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE COOPERATIVE The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases Cooperative Agreement provides financial support and technical assistance to the nation\u2019s health departments to detect, prevent, and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The ELC\u2019s 64 recipients, which consist of state, large local, and United States (US) territory and affiliate health departments, serve as the foundation for our national public health infrastructure and are integral to the nation\u2019s ability to tackle infectious disease threats. The ELC accomplishes its mission through a unique structure of four robust public health programs; five cross-cutting projects focusing on leadership, integration, flexibility, and sustainability; and a range of disease-specific projects. The ELC also distributes supplemental funding on behalf of CDC for emergency response efforts, such as those for the influenza H1N1, Zika, and Ebola epidemics, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. The HVPHC was able to utilize a portion of these funds to complete the M-H Region Community Health Survey.

It is maintained by the NYS Bureau of Vital Records, a branch of the NYSDOH. Secondary source DATA NOTES American Community Survey (ACS): Following pandemic-related data collection disruptions, the Census Bureau revised its methodology to reduce nonresponse bias in data collected in 2020. After evaluating the effectiveness of this methodology, the Census Bureau determined the standard, full suite of 2016\u20132020 ACS 5-year data are fit for public release. The revised methodology improves the 2020 weighted survey responses by comparing characteristics for responding and nonresponding households using administrative, third-party, and decennial census data. This provides key insight into how those who participated may be different than those who did not and allowed an adjustment to make the data more representative of the entire population. The resulting 2020 input data were then integrated with the inputs from 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (processed using standard ACS methodology) to produce the 5-year data products. Crude Rate versus Age-Adjusted Rate: A crude rate is defined as the total number of cases or disease events divided by the total population. The age-adjusted rates are rates that would have existed if the population under study had the same age distribution as the \"standard\" population. Therefore, they are summary measures adjusted for differences in age distributions. Age-adjusted rates are used when available and are calculated using the US 2000 standard population.3 International Classification of Diseases: In 2015 the Department of Health and Human Services mandated those entities using ICD-9 codes transition to ICD-10 codes. Comparisons between data before and after 2015 cannot be made due to the many differences in the updated ICD-10-CM code set. New York State excluding New York City (NYS excl NYC): The population of NYC is not similar to that of the Mid-Hudson Region. Therefore, comparing rates/percentages of counties to NYS excluding NYC, rather 3 United States Census Bureau, 2022, https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/acs-5-year-estimates.html, accessed October 2022 Introduction 19 than to the whole of NYS, provides a more accurate comparison. When possible, measures for both NYS and NYS excluding NYC are provided. When NYS excluding NYC data are not available comparisons should be made with caution. Rate: A rate is a measure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time. Suppressed and Unstable Data: Some rates/percentages based on small numbers are suppressed because they do not meet the criteria for confidentiality (notated by \u201cs\u201d). Other rates/percentages based on small numbers are presented but are not considered reliable since they can fluctuate greatly over time. These measures are indicated as unstable due to a small numerator (notated by \u201c*\u201d). Three-Year Rate versus Single-Year Rate: When possible, rates are based on a three-year average rather than a single-year estimate to provide a more reliable comparison. Using a three-year average smooths out the data over multiple years to recognize that rates fluctuate from year to year and is particularly useful when small amounts of data are an issue.

Demographic Summary 33 DEMOGRAPHIC SUMMARY POPULATION In 2020, New York State\u2019s (NYS) population was nearly 20 million. When excluding New York City (NYC), the population was 11,135,297. The Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region) made up 11.9% of NYS\u2019 population and includes the seven counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester. Westchester County comprised the largest portion of the M-H Region\u2019s population at 41.7%, while Sullivan County made up only 3.2% of the M-H Region [see Table 20]. The population of the M-H Region grew 4.7% from 2010 to 2020. In those 10 years, growth increased most rapidly in Rockland (7.9%) and Orange (7.1%). Putnam (-2.1%), and Ulster (-0.4%) had negative growth.10 Table 20 Population Demographic Characteristics, 2020 Population Percent of Mid-Hudson Region Percent of NYS Dutchess 293,524 12.6 1.5 Orange 382,077 16.5 2.0 Putnam 98,714 4.3 0.5 Rockland 325,213 14 1.7 Sullivan 75,329 3.2 0.4 Ulster 178,371 7.7 0.9 Westchester 968,738 41.7 5.0 Mid-Hudson 2,321,966 100.0 11.9 NYS excl NYC 11,135,297 N/A 57.1 NYS 19,514,849 N/A 100.0 Source: U.S. Census Bureau; American Community Survey, 2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, Table S0101 https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=s0101&g=0400000US36_0500000US36027,36071,36079,36087,36105,36111,36119_ 1600000US3651000&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0101 10 United States Census Bureau, https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=decennial%20population&g=0500000US36027%248600000,36071%248600000,36079%248600000, 36087%248600000,36105%248600000,36111%248600000,36119%248600000&d=DEC%20Summary%20File%201&tid=DECENNIALSF1201 0.P1, accessed September 2022 Demographic Summary 34 SEX When stratifying the population by sex in 2020, the M-H Region had a near-even distribution between males and females [see Table 21].

The Hispanic population was the second most predominant racial/ethnic group, followed by the non-Hispanic Black population. Within the M-H Region, Westchester County had the highest Hispanic population (25.0%), the highest non-Hispanic Black population (13.4%), and the highest non-Hispanic Asian population (6.1%). Westchester County\u2019s racial/ethnic profile is most like that of NYS\u2019; however, the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites significantly increases when looking at NYS excluding NYC [see Table 23].

This includes where people are able to live, the food and health care coverage available, and almost every other social determinant of health.11 According to the American Community Survey, the base population for the income demographic category were households (all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence) [see Table 27]. Of this population, the largest portion of households in the M-H Region had an income greater than $100,000 in 2020 [see Table 28]. Almost one fourth of the households in Putnam County were making between $100,000 and $149,999 in 2020 (23.3%) [see Table 28]. There were many households with an income between $50,000 and $74,999 in the M-H Region and NYS; 16.6% of households in Sullivan County had an income within this bracket [see Table 28].

Various types of disabilities can affect an individual\u2019s quality of life. Types of disability include: \u2022 Independent living disability \u2013 difficulty performing tasks or errands alone, such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition \u2022 Cognitive disability \u2013 serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition \u2022 Self-care disability \u2013 difficulty handling tasks, such as dressing or bathing on one\u2019s own \u2022 Ambulatory disability \u2013 difficulty moving around physically, such as walking or climbing stairs \u2022 Hearing disability \u2013 deafness or serious difficulty hearing \u2022 Vision disability \u2013 blindness or serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses In the M-H Region, Sullivan County had the highest percentage of adults living with a disability (15.9%), as well as the highest percentage of adults living with each of the six types of disabilities; Rockland County had the lowest percentage of adults living with a disability (8.7%) [see Table 30].

Those with steady employment tend to have better health outcomes in both mental and physical health conditions than those who are unemployed. Even within employed populations, there are disparities between those with high-paying and low-paying jobs.15 Putnam and Westchester Counties had the highest percentage of individuals in the labor force (65.7% and 65.2%, respectively) which is similar to the 2017 data. Sullivan County had the lowest percentage of individuals in the labor force (58.3%) which is lower than both the New York State (NYS) and United States (US) rate. Putnam County continues to have the lowest unemployment rate (5.3% in 2017 and 4.6% in 2020) in the Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region). The majority of counties have a lower unemployment rate than NYS\u2019 rate of 5.7%, except Westchester (5.7%) and Sullivan which has the M-H Region\u2019s highest unemployment rate at 7.3% [see Figure 1]. Figure 1 Note: The American Community Survey asks respondents if they have worked in the past week. If the answer is no, they are asked why they are not working. For those who are not working, they are asked whether they plan to return to work, and when they last worked.

Children are affected by food insecurity at a higher rate than the general population. Healthy food plays a key role in a child\u2019s development. Children who face hunger are more likely to struggle in school, face developmental impairments, and have more social and behavioral problems than children who do not face hunger.17 16 Healthy People 2030, US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/food-insecurity, accessed July 2022 17 Feeding America, 2019, https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/study-shows-children-more-likely-face-hunger-overall-population-across-america, accessed August 2022 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining Construction Manufacturing Wholesale trade Retail trade Transportation and warehousing, and utilities Information Finance and insurance, and real estate and rental and leasing Professional, scientific, and management, and administrative and waste management services Educational services, and health care and social assistance Arts, entertainment, and recreation, and accommodation and food services Other services, except public administration Public administration Percent of Employment by Industry, 2020 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS US Social and Physical Determinants of Health 46 Other populations more vulnerable to food insecurity than the overall population include:18 \u2022 Senior Populations \u2022 Those living in rural communities \u2022 Black Populations \u2022 Hispanic Populations \u2022 Those living in poverty Feeding America used data from the US Census Bureau Current Population Survey (CPS) to generate food insecurity rates.

Second, those that respond \u201cmore\u201d are asked an additional question about how much more money they need to meet their basic food needs.19 Putnam County had the lowest food insecurity rate in the M-H Region at 6.3% (2020), and in all the other years listed. The county with the highest rate of food insecurity was Sullivan County at 11.5%, which was greater than NYS\u2019 rate of 9.6% [see Figure 3] Figure 3 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS 2017 8.6% 8.9% 4.6% 8.9% 10.7% 10.0% 7.7% 11.4% 2018 8.7% 9.0% 5.8% 9.0% 11.4% 10.5% 7.8% 11.1% 2019 8.5% 9.1% 6.0% 9.0% 11.7% 11.0% 7.5% 10.7% 2020 8.7% 9.4% 6.3% 9.7% 11.5% 11.3% 7.9% 9.6% Note: Feeding America takes the CPS data and analyzes the relationships between food insecurity and its determinants (i.e., unemployment, poverty, disability, homeownership, and median income), as well as the percentage of the population that is Black and the percentage of the population that is Hispanic.

Poor health is often both the cause and effect of unstable, poor, or non-existent housing. Mental health also plays a large role in the causes and effects of homelessness. Housing alone does not guarantee better health outcomes in all areas; quality of housing is also important. For example, children who live in public housing are two times more likely to have asthma than other children due to a higher prevalence of mold in public housing.21 The median percentage of household income spent on housing in the M-H Region is estimated to be 37.0% by United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).22 Households that spend greater than 30.0% of their income on housing are considered cost burdened. Households that are severely cost burdened (spending greater than 50.0% of income on housing) are shown to spend 75.0% less on health care compared to similar households that are living in affordable housing.23 Rockland County had both the highest percentage of cost burdened renter occupied units and the highest percentage of severely cost burdened households in the region at 60.7% and 22.0%, respectively. Sullivan County had the lowest percentage of cost burdened renter occupied units (49.5%) and lowest percentage of severely cost burdened households (14.0%) [see Figure 5, Figure 6]. All counties, except for Sullivan, exceeded NYS for both cost burdened renter occupied units and percentage of severely cost burdened households. 20 The Atlantic, 2016, https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/how-health-and-homelessness-are-connectedmedically/458871/, accessed July 2022 21 Urban Institute, The National Center for Health in Public Housing, 2017, https://nchph.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UI-2017-Housing-and-Asthma-among-School-Age-Children-AHS-2015-1.pdf, accessed July 2022 22 Housing Infographic, 2022, https://infograph.venngage.com/ps/BDxQHEPVBXs/housing, accessed August 2022 23 Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2017, https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/harvard_jchs_state_of_the_nations_housing_2017_chap6.pdf, accessed July 2022 Social and Physical Determinants of Health 49 Figure 5 Note: The American Community Survey asks respondents if they own or rent the house, apartment, or mobile home they live in.

Those who drop out of high school have an increased risk of premature death, are more likely to report at least one chronic health condition, and more likely to experience poverty when compared to those who have graduated.29 Research has revealed several factors that impact the likelihood of graduation include schools with safety issues, teachers\u2019 lack of interest in students, and perceived ineffective and unfair punishment.30 All factors are associated with lower graduation rates. In the M-H Region, Putnam County has the highest graduation rate (94.0%), while Sullivan County has the lowest (82.0%). All counties in the M-H Region, with the exception of Sullivan County, have a graduation rate above NYS [see Figure 10].

Stressors such as poverty, physical abuse, family instability, and unsafe neighborhoods are all contributors to early life stress.35 ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events that occur during childhood such as \u201cexperiencing violence, abuse, or neglect; having a family member attempt or die by suicide; and witnessing violence in the home.\u201d36 Elements of a child\u2019s environment that weaken their sense of safety, stability, and bonding such as substance misuse, mental health complications, or family instability (including divorce or incarceration of parents and relatives) contribute to ACEs. ACEs can have lasting effects on health, behavior, and life potential, including obesity, diabetes, depression, suicide attempts, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), heart disease, cancer, stroke, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), broken bones, smoking, alcoholism, drug use, graduation rates, academic achievement, lost time from work, etc. Growing research shows that toxic stress as a result of ACEs can damage \u201cthe most basic levels of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system,\u201d and can modify the physical structure of DNA.37 ACEs can be prevented by producing and preserving safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for children and families. In 2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created technical packages to help communities and states prevent the occurrences of ACEs. Strategies include: \u2022 Strengthening economic supports for families \u2022 Promoting social norms that protect against violence and adversity \u2022 Ensuring a strong start for children and paving the way for them to reach their full potential \u2022 Teaching skills to help parents and youth handle stress, manage emotions, and tackle everyday challenges \u2022 Connecting youth to caring adults and activities \u2022 Intervening to lessen immediate and long-term harms New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\u2019s (BRFSS) data on \u201cPrevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences, 2018\u201d can be found in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Assessment, 2019-2021.

Activities can be formal or informal and often benefit society or other group members. Civic participation has been shown to improve health by expanding social networks and social trust, which can increase physical activity and improve mental health.42 Participating in the electoral process through voting can be a good indicator of civic participation in a community. In NYS a voter is considered inactive if they have not responded to a residence confirmation notice sent by the local Board of Elections. If a voter has an inactive status and does not vote in two consecutive federal elections, they are then removed from the list of registered voters in the fifth year of inactivity. In 2020, Sullivan County had the highest percentage of inactive voters at 13.2%. Rockland County had the lowest percentage of inactive voters at 5.8% [see Figure 15].

This type of treatment can adversely affect health, whether the discrimination is perceived to be intentional or unintentional. \u201cDiscrimination can be understood as a social stressor that has a physiological effect on individuals (e.g., irregular heartbeat, anxiety, heartburn) that can be compounded over time and can lead to long-term negative health outcomes.\u201d48 Discrimination can be measured by every day or major discriminatory events. Residential segregation is an example of major discrimination, as it stems from structural racism. Causes vary and include being refused to be rented to or being unfairly denied a bank loan. The implications of residential segregation are extensive, impacting quality of education, access to healthy food options and physical activities, safety, and transportation, and contribute to disparities in health status across groups.49 47 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/discrimination, accessed July 2022 48 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/discrimination, accessed October 2022 49 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/discrimination, accessed October 2022 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 2014-2018 2015-2019 2016-2020 Percent Percent of Disconnected Youth (Age 16-19 Years), 2014-2018, 2015-2019, and 2016-2020 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS Social and Physical Determinants of Health 64 In the US, residential segregation between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations is a key determinant of health disparity, leading to poor health outcomes including mortality and reproductive and chronic diseases.50 Data produced by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps around residential segregation uses the American Community Survey to measure the distribution of non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White residents across census tracks. The index is used to measure residential segregation; zero represents complete integration, while 100 is complete segregation. The index score can also represent the percentage of either non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White residents who would have to move to a different geographic area in order to produce a distribution that matches that of the larger area. Westchester County had the highest index score of residential segregation in the M-H Region at 59, still falling under NYS\u2019 score of 74. The county with the lowest index score was Putnam County with a score of 44. The M-H Region is more integrated than NYS [see Figure 18].

Cost is a prominent barrier to receiving health services and can deter people from seeking preventative care. The Survey of Income and Program Participation in 2017 showed that 19% of US households carried medical debt, meaning that people were unable to pay medical costs up front or when they received care.52 Within the M-H Region, the highest percentage of adults who did not receive medical care due to cost was reported in Ulster County at 12.7%. Westchester County had the lowest percentage (7.5%) of adults who did not receive medical care due to cost. The M-H Region (8.4%), Dutchess County (7.7%), Orange County (8.5%), and Westchester County (7.5%) all had a lower percentage than NYS (11.3%) [see Figure 19].

Uninsured people are less likely to receive preventative services and treatments than those who are insured, including chronic condition care, dental care, immunizations, and well-child visits.53 Several government programs, such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, help provide low and no-cost insurance to children who qualify. The US Census Bureau\u2019s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program calculates estimates of health insurance coverage. Estimates are created for the population under the age of 65 and for children under the age of 19. According to these estimates, more adults are without health insurance than children in the M-H Region. Putnam County has the lowest rate of adults without health insurance (5.0%) and Sullivan has the greatest rate (8.0%). Adults in all M-H Region counties, except for Sullivan, have a lower percentage of residents without insurance than NYS. Sullivan County had an increase (1.0%) in adults without health insurance, Orange had a decrease (1.0%), and all other counties stayed the same between 2018 and 2019 [see Figure 20]. Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester Counties have the same rate of children without health insurance as NYS (2.0%). Dutchess, Sullivan, and Ulster Counties have more children without health insurance (3.0%). Orange, Rockland, and Westchester had a decrease (1.0%), Putnam, Sullivan and Ulster stayed the same, and Dutchess increased (1.0%) between 2018 and 2019 [see Figure 20].

MUAs have a shortage of primary care health services for residents within a geographic area. Some examples include a whole county, urban census tracts, or civil divisions. MUPs have a shortage of primary care health services for a specific population subset within an established geographic area.54 These groups may face economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to health care. An Index of Medical Underservice (IMU) score is calculated. An IMU score ranges between 0 (highest need) and 100 (lowest need). In order to qualify as an MUA the score must be less than or equal to 62.0.

When measuring the ratio of population to provider, a higher ratio means less providers per capita, implying less access. Sullivan County had the highest ratio of residents to primary care providers and the number of providers continues to decrease since 2020. Westchester County had the best resident to provider ratio.

Personal health literacy is defined as \u201cthe degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.\u201d59 Organizational health literacy is defined as \u201cthe degree to which organizations equitably enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.\u201d60 Limited health literacy negatively affects health and is associated with \u201cless participation in health-promotion and disease-detection activities, riskier health choices, more work accidents, diminished management of chronic diseases, poor adherence to medication, increased hospitalization and rehospitalization, increased morbidity, and premature death.\u201d61 It is important to note that the responsibility of health literacy does not fall solely on the 59 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-literacy-healthy-people-2030, accessed July 2022 60 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-literacy-healthy-people-2030, accessed July 2022 61 World Health Organization, https://www.who.int/europe/teams/behavioural-and-cultural-insights/health-literacy, accessed July 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 2017 3573.4 3544.9 2962.2 2812.7 4967.2 4365.3 3490.3 3436.9 4104.4 2018 3525.1 3459.8 2945.7 2708.7 4900.0 4325.3 3510.1 3477.0 4147.4 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 Rate per 10,000 Age-Adjusted Rate of Total Emergency Department Visits per 10,000, 2017 and 2018 Social and Physical Determinants of Health 73 patient. It is also the responsibility of the service provider and their institution to ensure that resources and information being shared are communicated in an appropriate, understandable way. Increasing health literacy in populations has positive effects on society, including the notion that \u201chealth literate individuals participate more actively in economic prosperity, have higher earnings and rates of employment, are more educated and informed, contribute more to community activities, and enjoy better health and well-being.\u201d62 NEIGHBORHOOD AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT ACCESS TO FOODS THAT SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS Healthy dietary patterns are essential to living a healthy lifestyle. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy or fortified dairy alternatives, protein foods, and plant-based oils.63 A healthy diet lowers risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.64 It is also essential for managing chronic conditions and preventing complications for those who have chronic diagnoses.65 When measuring food access, travel time to supermarkets, availability of healthy foods, and food prices all play a role.66 For those without a personal vehicle, convenient public transportation, or a supermarket within walking distance, finding fresh, healthy options can be a challenge. High grocery prices can deter people with lower socioeconomic status from purchasing healthy options, minimizing food access. Low-income communities tend to have more difficulty accessing food, and a study in Detroit found that people living in predominantly Black low-income neighborhoods travel an average of 1.1 miles farther to the closest supermarket than people living in predominantly White low-income neighborhoods.67 The County Health Rankings and Roadmaps measure of the food environment accounts for proximity to healthy foods and income. The index is a scale that ranges from zero (worst) to 10 (best). Limited access to healthy foods estimates the percentage of the population that is low income and does not live close to a grocery store. Food insecurity estimates the percentage of the population that did not have access to a reliable source of food during the past year.68 Ulster County had the lowest food environment index, while Westchester and Putnam Counties had the highest. The majority of counties fell below NYS\u2019 score of 9.0, except for Westchester and Putnam Counties [see Figure 26]. 62 World Health Organization, https://www.who.int/europe/teams/behavioural-and-cultural-insights/health-literacy, accessed July 2022 63 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, US Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, 2020, https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf, accessed July 2022 64 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/nutrition.htm, accessed September 2022 65 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/about-nutrition/pdfs/Nutrition-Fact-Sheet-H.pdf, accessed July 2022 66 Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, 2020, https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-choices-health/food-access/, accessed July 2022 67 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/access-foods-support-healthy-eating-patterns#cit14, accessed July 2022 68 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2022, https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/health-behaviors/diet-exercise/food-environment-index, accessed July 2022 Social and Physical Determinants of Health 74 Figure 26 Source: University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.

The \u201climited access to healthy foods\u201d indicator measures the percentage of the population that is low-income and does not live close to a grocery store. \u201cLow-income is defined as having an annual family income of less than or equal to 200% of the federal poverty line.\u201d70 According to this measure, 7.0% of Putnam County\u2019s population has limited access to healthy food, making it the highest in the M-H Region and eight times more than Westchester County, which has the lowest percentage at 1.0%.

County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2022 https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new-york/2022/measure/factors/83/data CRIME AND VIOLENCE Crime and violence both pose as major public health issues on various levels. Violent crime can affect the quality of life for those it reaches, including victims of violent crimes, witnesses of violent crimes, or residents who hear about violent crimes in their areas. Studies have shown that those who fear crime in their communities engage in less physical activity and as a result may have higher Body Mass Indexes (BMIs) and levels of obesity. Exposure to violence can also have negative impacts on mental health. Consequences can particularly affect children and adolescents. It can increase behavioral problems, depression, anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and can lead to risky behavior, such as substance use, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving.71 The NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services collects crime reports from police and sheriffs\u2019 departments to submit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as New York\u2019s official crime statistics. Violent crime totals include reports of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Orange County had the highest rate of reported violent crimes (192.4 per 100,000 population), while Putnam County had the lowest rate (48.5 per 10,000 population). All seven counties of the M-H Region were below the NYS and the NYS excluding New York City (NYC) rates [see Figure 28].

Negative consequences resulting from exposure to fine particulate matter in the air include, but are not limited to, decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis, and premature death.75 Air particulate matter can come from a variety of sources, such as automobiles, industry, and forest fires. Westchester County had the highest average daily density of fine particulate matter for the three years reported. Orange County had the lowest measure for the three years reported.

Sources of water contamination include: \u2022 Sewage releases \u2022 Naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, arsenic, radon, and uranium) \u2022 Local land use practices (for example, fertilizers, pesticides, livestock, and concentrated feeding operations) \u2022 Manufacturing processes (for example, heavy metals and cyanide) \u2022 Malfunctioning on-site wastewater treatment systems (for example, septic systems)76 Runoff can pose a risk to water quality and the health of the people exposed to it. When it rains, as water flows over impervious surfaces, such as pavement, it can pick up contaminants. Pollution can originate over large land areas or from a single point, such as an industrial pipe. Runoff can pick up sediment, nutrients, bacteria, pesticides, or petroleum byproducts from sources such as farms, waste, and roadways.77 \u201cThe presence of certain contaminants in our water can lead to health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for illness.\u201d78 FLUORIDATION Community water fluoridation is an effective intervention for preventing tooth decay. CDC named community water fluoridation one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.79 Studies have found that rural communities are less likely to have adequately fluoridated water when compared with urban communities.80 Rural populations are more likely to rely on untreated domestic wells than their urban counterparts and their communities may find investing in fluoridation more cost prohibitive.81 In the M-H Region, Westchester County had the highest percentage of residents who obtain water from a community water system with optimally fluoridated water at 85.6%. Westchester County exceeded the NYS and NYS excluding NYC levels. The other counties of the M-H Region had levels that were below the NYS and NYS excluding NYC levels. Rockland County did not have stable data to interpret [see Figure 32]. 76 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_quality.html, accessed August 2022 77 US Geological Survey, Water Science School, 2018, https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/runoff-surface-and-overland-water-runoff?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects, accessed August 2022 78 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_quality.html, accessed August 2022 79 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html, accessed August 2022 80 Rural Health Information Hub, https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/oral-health/2/community-water-fluoridation-model, accessed August 2022 81 Rural Health Information Hub, https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/oral-health/2/community-water-fluoridation-model, accessed August 2022 Social and Physical Determinants of Health 81 Figure 32 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS 2012 0.0% 37.0% 0.0%* 0.0%* 17.2% 3.6% 88.7% 47.4% 71.4% 2013 0.0% 37.1% 0.0%* 0.0%* 17.3% 3.6% 88.7% 47.4% 71.4% 2014 0.1% 37.7% 0.2% 0.0%* 17.7% 3.6% 83.5% 46.9% 71.1% 2015 0.1% 38.0% 0.3% 0.0%* 18.3% 3.6% 85.7% 46.9% 71.2% 2016 0.1% 37.2% 0.2% 0.0%* 17.3% 3.6% 85.8% 46.9% 71.1% 2017 0.1% 36.6% 0.2% 0.0%* 17.2% 3.6% 85.8% 46.6% 70.8% 2018 0.1% 36.3% 0.3% 0.0%* 16.9% 3.6% 85.6% 47.0% 71.2% 2019 0.1% 36.3% 0.3% 0.0%* 16.8% 3.5% 85.6% 46.9% 71.1% *: Fewer than 10 events in the numerator, therefore the rate/percentage is unstable.

Children are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of lead exposure which can lead to slowed growth and development, damage to the brain and nervous system, behavioral problems, and hearing and speech problems.82 Lead exposure can occur from ingesting, coming in contact with, or breathing in lead dust or lead fumes.83 Sources of lead can include lead-based paints in homes built before 1978, consumer products such as certain 82 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/health-effects.htm, accessed August 2022 83 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/exposure.html, accessed August 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Percent Percent of Residents Served by Optimally Fluoridated Community Water Systems, 2017-2019 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Social and Physical Determinants of Health 82 jewelry or toys, aviation gas, working with stained glass, and water pipes that contain lead.84 For children, lead-based paint is the most common source of lead exposure.85 Populations at higher risk for lead exposure include children from low-income households, children less than six years old, immigrant and refugee children from less developed countries, pregnant people, and adults working in industries that expose them to lead.86 NYS requires health care providers to obtain a blood lead level for all children at age one and again at age two.87 Westchester County had the highest testing rate in the Mid-Hudson Region with 64.3% of children born in 2016 tested. Sullivan County had the lowest testing rate at 46.1%. Only Rockland and Westchester Counties exceeded NYS\u2019 rate in 2013 and only Westchester exceeded NYS\u2019 rate in 2016 [see Figure 33].

Poor housing quality is associated with negative health outcomes including poor mental health, chronic disease, and injury.89 Housing, especially during the current housing crisis, is expensive. In addition to inflated rents and mortgages, poor quality housing may cost more to heat, lack air conditioning, possess inadequate plumbing systems, and lack proper kitchen facilities. Fluctuating temperatures can make temperature regulation challenging, further exacerbating poor health outcomes. For those trying to lead healthy lifestyles, housing that lacks a stove or refrigerator makes storing and cooking fresh fruits and vegetables more difficult. It can also have implications on the storage of medications, as some must be kept in cool temperatures. Additionally, inadequate plumbing can make personal and environmental hygiene challenging. Low-income families may be more likely to experience poor quality housing, highlighting social class disparities in housing.90 For this measure severe housing problems is the percentage of households with one or more of the following housing problems: lack of complete kitchen facilities, lack of complete plumbing facilities, overcrowding, and severely cost burdened households. Rockland County had the highest percentage (26.0%) of households with severe housing problems, three percent higher than that of NYS (23.0%). Putnam and Sullivan Counties had the lowest percentage (17.0% and 17.0%, respectively) of households with severe housing problems [see Figure 35]. 89 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/quality-housing, accessed August 2022 90 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/quality-housing, accessed September 2022 Social and Physical Determinants of Health 85 Figure 35 Note: The US Census Bureau gathers data called the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy, and these data are shared with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development for reporting purposes. Incomplete kitchen facilities are defined as a unit which lacks a sink with running water, a stove or range, or a refrigerator. Incomplete plumbing facilities is defined as lacking hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, or a bathtub/shower. Overcrowding is defined as more than one person per room. Severe cost burden is defined as monthly housing costs, including utilities, that exceed 50% of monthly income.

County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2022 https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new-york/2022/measure/factors/136/data TRANSPORTATION Transportation can include walking, driving, biking, or utilizing public transportation, such as subways and buses. Access to transportation can affect all aspects of life including the ability to find or keep employment, the quantity and quality of food that can be accessed, and access to health care. Studies have shown that those with access to a car are less likely to miss appointments or delay care when compared to those relying on other forms of transportation.91 In the M-H Region, Westchester County had the highest percentage of households with no available vehicles at 14.0%. Putnam County had the lowest percentage of households with no available vehicles at 4.6%.

Pros to choosing mass public transportation, walking, and biking include protecting the environment by producing far less air pollution than cars and engaging in physical activity.92 However, these modes require individuals to rely more heavily on proper infrastructure, investment, and city planning to make travel safe and effective. Car-dependent cities and communities make it more difficult to use alternative modes of transportation to complete necessary daily tasks like going to the grocery store or getting to school, due to lack of safe sidewalks and public transportation options.93 The transportation method in which people most often get to work can be an indicator of how car-dependent an area is or how conducive it is to alternative modes of transportation. 92 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/transportation, accessed August 2022 93 Elsevier Ltd., ScienceDirect, 2020, https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2590198220301494?token=CF722B942BA01129C596B52298FF8C7D1F1F4F21256458ED5630257 A6DACF91D844AAC3FC8413BCC277B984F0630B7C3&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20220804131701, accessed August 2022 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 2014-2018 2015-2019 2016-2020 Percent Percent Households with No Vehicles Available, 2014-2018, 2015-2019, and 2016-2020 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS Social and Physical Determinants of Health 87 The majority of residents in the M-H Region report driving alone to work as their most common means of commuting.

Long commute times can indicate a lack of job opportunities in an area, slow transit options, and a higher transportation cost burden on households and individuals.94 It can also negatively impact the community as it contributes to pollution. Putnam, Westchester, and Orange Counties had the longest mean commute times in the M-H Region at 40.0 minutes, 35.3 minutes, and 34.4 minutes, respectively, falling above the mean commute time of NYS (33.5 minutes).

The survey instrument was developed collaboratively by local health departments in the seven counties of New York\u2019s Mid-Hudson Region and The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) to further explore regional health and well-being and inform future health improvement efforts. The 52-question survey was designed to assess overall quality of life, social determinants of health, perception of health and well-being, health behaviors, access and utilization of health services, and COVID-19 pandemic impacts. The 2022 survey is the second iteration of this project and contains many of the same questions previously offered in 2018 to allow for assessment of changes over a timeframe that corresponds to the COVID-19 pandemic. This cycle, survey results are particularly critical for the CHA as a supplement to secondary data sources whose availability, timeliness, and in some cases, validity were impacted by the pandemic. METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI), on behalf of the seven local health departments (LHDs) of the Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region), conducted a public opinion survey of 5,699 residents from March 14, 2022 to May 22, 2022. New York State\u2019s (NYS) M-H Region is comprised of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester Counties. Residents aged 18 and older were interviewed from the M-H Region to ensure representative county-wide samples. The margin of error for the total sample of 5,699 is +/- 2.1% including the design effects resulting from weighting with a 95% confidence interval. This means that in 95 out of every 100 samples of the same size and type, the results we obtain would vary by no more than plus or minus 2.1 percentage points from the result we would get if we could interview every member of the population. The overall sample of 5,699 was weighted by age, gender, reported race/ethnicity, income and county using the 2015-2020 American Community Survey 5-year estimates to ensure statistical representativeness. Respondents were contacted via landline telephone, cell phone, an online panel, and online recruitment from each county at various in-person events and other community partnerships to enhance representation and meet budget constraints. The design of the landline sample was conducted to ensure the selection of both listed and unlisted telephone numbers, using random digit dialing (RDD). The cell phone sample was drawn from a sample of dedicated wireless telephone exchanges from within each of the M-H Region counties. Respondents were screened for residence in NYS and specified counties. Data from all four sources were combined and weighted as one universe to provide a representative sample of M-H Region residents. SCRI made calls between 1pm and 9pm Monday through Thursday, and between 2pm and 8pm on Sundays. Landline telephone numbers were purchased from ASDE Survey Sampler and cell phone numbers were purchased from Dynata (formerly Survey Sampling International). Up to seven calls were placed to each phone number to establish if the phone number was in service. Telephone surveys were conducted in English or Spanish. The online sample was provided by Lucid, a market research platform that runs an online exchange for survey respondents. The samples drawn from this exchange matched a set of demographic quotas on age, gender, and region. Respondents were sent from Lucid directly to survey software operated by the SCRI. All respondents that took the survey online completed an attention check prior to taking the survey. Additional attention checks were Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey 91 placed in the survey to ensure proper attention was being paid throughout the entire survey. Online panel surveys were conducted in English. The online recruitment from each county included distributing the survey URL to community partners, promoting the survey on social media, and providing access to the survey at community events. The online recruitment survey was conducted in English and Spanish. In 2018, SCRI conducted a similar survey for the M-H Region. In that iteration, respondent data was collected via RDD dual-frame telephone interviews and augmented through the use of the Lucid panel. In 2018, each county\u2019s oversample of ZIP codes with residents with the lowest levels of income were included in the unweighted samples. In both 2018 and 2022, each county estimate was similarly weighted to the most current demographic estimates of the county's population by age, gender, reported race/ethnicity, and income. As such, and despite sampling design differences, the final weighted estimates by county and the final weighted regional estimates from 2018 and 2022 can be fairly compared to one another. NATURE OF THE SAMPLE A total of 5,699 surveys were collected with an average of 814 surveys collected per county. Weighted proportions of demographic categories are presented below.

Underrepresented populations include those who have a low-income, veterans, seniors, people experiencing homelessness, LGBTQIA+ members, and people with a mental health diagnosis. In order to ensure the needs of each population were met, focus groups were conducted and surveys administered through partners within the community. The term \u201cpartners\u201d refers to those who offer services such as mental health support, vocational programs, and programs for underserved populations. Conducting focus groups and surveying partners was completed to gain a better understanding of the obstacles and barriers these populations are facing when trying to access services. Dutchess, Orange, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester Counties created a survey tool based on the survey utilized in 2018. Each participating LHD shared a survey link with partners to supply additional insight around local factors influencing community health. The survey covered several topics including the populations the partners serve, the issues that affect health in the communities they serve, barriers to people achieving better health, and interventions that are used to address social determinants of health [see Appendix K]. Throughout the M-H Region, 84 surveys were completed by partners. The answers to the survey varied throughout each county. Some counties chose to further investigate these differences by conducting focus groups. When looking at data from the M-H Region, the top three issues partners felt affected health in their communities included: access to affordable, decent, and safe housing; access to mental health providers; and access to affordable, reliable transportation. The top three barriers partners felt prevented people from achieving better health in their communities were: knowledge of existing resources, health literacy, and geographic location (living in a rural area). Chronic diseases, health disparities, and mental health and substance use issues were thought to highly impact these specific populations in the M-H Region. In the following sections, the data was broken down by each county with three primary sections: Major Findings, Current Efforts, and Specific Recommendations. These data points can help guide the work to address the needs of underserved populations. Putnam County chose to not participate in the Community Partner Survey and instead opted to assess partner assets and resources. This assessment is included in the Putnam County section below. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 145 DUTCHESS COUNTY In Dutchess County, 31 responses were collected from providers that serve a variety of populations [see Appendix L]. The Dutchess County Department of Behavioral and Community Health (DBCH) conducted a focus group that took place through the Eastern Dutchess Rural Health Network. Several agencies were represented in the meeting, and the discussion was centered around the survey questions that were distributed prior to the focus group [see Appendix K]. The survey showed that the top three issues that affected health in Dutchess County were [see Figure 137]: 1) Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing 2) Access to reliable public transportation 3) Access to mental health providers The survey also showed that the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Dutchess County were [see Figure 138]: 1) Knowledge of existing resources 2) Drug and/or alcohol use 3) Geographic location \u2013 living in a rural area According to survey responses, issues highly impacting health in Dutchess communities include chronic diseases, health disparities, and mental health and substance use issues [see Figure 139]. In many cases, the M-H Region Community Health Survey responses supported the provider survey responses and vice versa. For example, over 90% of residents in Dutchess County either responded completely true (62%) or somewhat true (31%) to the statement \u201cpeople may have a hard time finding a quality place to live due to the high cost of housing.\u201d This reflects the provider responses which listed access to affordable, decent, and safe housing as the number one issue that affects health in Dutchess County. In the M-H Region Community Survey, when responding to the statement \u201cpeople can get to where they need to go using public transportation,\u201d 54% of respondents answered not very true (26%) or not at all true (23%). 40% responded either not very true (23%) or not at all true (17%) to the statement \u201cthere are sufficient mental health providers.\u201d These responses mirror the order in which providers ranked the top three issues affecting health in Dutchess County: access to affordable decent and safe housing; access to reliable public transportation; access to mental health providers. The focus group gave an opportunity for agency providers to expand upon these issues and barriers. MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 Navigating the healthcare system is a challenge for both patients and service providers. Hispanic populations in Eastern Dutchess are especially affected by these challenges due to language and cultural barriers, and for some, the challenges of being undocumented. \u2022 Insurance presents a barrier to care in a variety of ways. Those who are undocumented have trouble getting health insurance at all. Insurance was also pointed to as a complication for hospitals attempting to provide maternity care and family health. It was brought up as a possible cause of patients being diverted away from Sharon Hospital\u2019s maternity ward. \u2022 Sharon Hospital is closing its maternity ward due to lack of patients. Other nearby hospitals such as Columbia and Windham are closing their maternity wards due to lack of physicians. The cause of Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 146 Sharon\u2019s lack of patients is not fully understood. It seems many patients are ending up in Poughkeepsie even if they live closer to Sharon Hospital. \u2022 Communication between institutions is an area that could be targeted for improvement. For example, Sharon Hospital was not listed on New York State\u2019s (NYS\u2019) list of stroke centers though they were only a few miles from the border. This was a barrier to improving patient outcomes because patients should be brought to the nearest stroke center. This issue was resolved, but it demonstrated the importance of having \u201cthe right people in the right places at the right time.\u201d \u2022 Finding access to specialty care is a difficulty and requires better communication. Those trying to connect people to care know that services are available but finding how to access them is still a struggle. There are a \u201cwealth of services,\u201d however connecting services to those who need it is a challenge. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Care management is an important component to connect people and organizations. \u2022 Organizations need ensure they are communicating to make their systems easier to navigate. \u2022 Kinship circles are an aspect of care management that can be replicated. \u2022 The county needs to build back its workforce after it was pared down due to COVID-19.

The Orange County Department of Health (OCDOH) conducted two focus groups. The first was with the Joint Membership of Health and Community Agencies (JMHCA). Their focus is on providing residents of Orange County with a welcoming, comprehensive, and seamless service delivery system for recovery, health, and wellness. The second was with the Changing the Orange County Addiction Treatment Ecosystem. Discussions were centered around the survey questions distributed prior to the focus groups. Focus group attendees included organizations such as Rehabilitation Support Services, Regional Economic Community Action Program (RECAP Inc.), Mental Health Association, Action Towards Independence, Fearless!, Orange County Department of Mental Health, and the American Lung Association. In addition, the survey was e-mailed out to human service providers throughout Orange County through the JMHCA, Changing the Ecosystem, and Resiliency Committee listservs. The survey showed that the top three issues that affect health in Orange County were: 1) Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing 2) Access to mental health providers 3) Access to affordable, reliable, personal, and public transportation The survey also showed that the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Orange County were: 1) Drug and/or alcohol use 2) Knowledge of existing resources 3) Health literacy Issues highly impacting health in the communities as listed by survey respondents include mental health and substance abuse issues, maternal and child health issues, chronic disease, and health disparities. The focus groups gave an opportunity for agency providers to expand upon these issues and barriers. MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 A lack of affordable and/or consistent transportation is a major issue for many residents of Orange County. This includes lacking the financial means to get to and from appointments/work, a lack of available public transportation, and an absence of knowledge of the transportation options that are available (n=13). \u2022 Affordable and safe housing is a challenge for many. This leaves many people homeless or, at the least, economically distressed (n=7). \u2022 Language barriers between the residents and service providers exist which can cause confusion and lack of adequate care (n=4). \u2022 An overall lack of knowledge of the resources that are available to the community exists. While there are many programs in place to assist residents, they can only be utilized when there is a knowledge and understanding of these services (n=6). \u2022 Mental health/addiction issues continue to plague our communities. This is in the form of mental health stigma, lack of providers, and the large number of individuals who are facing active addiction (n=7). Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 149 IMPACT OF COVID-19 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the existing issues in mental health have worsened. Available mental health providers have declined while mental health issues among the community have increased (n=11). The COVID-19 pandemic has also opened the door to virtual appointments for healthcare. While this has its benefits, there are also drawbacks to the lack of face-to-face interaction that comes with an in-person visit. Many residents are hesitant to come in person due to COVID-19 concerns and/or they enjoy the convenience of not having to leave home. Providers are also hesitant to bring too many people into the office for fear of spreading COVID-19, as well as entering the homes of their patients for in-home care (n=30). SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Holistic care management services dedicated to address the social determinants of health in every touch point in the systems where a client or patient may show up to address root causes of health issues. \u2022 Continuing to break down the silos of care for the complicated systems that patients/clients must navigate to address their health issues. \u2022 Expand availability of tele-health/tele-video services and broadband expansion for those that struggle with mental health issues, homelessness, and substance use. \u2022 Need for prioritization from local leaders to address the social determinants of health such as poverty, housing, and transportation and develop strategic opportunities for communities to work together and to build community awareness of these issues.

The goal of the survey was to create a comprehensive picture of the assets and resources that can and have been mobilized and employed to address the county\u2019s health issues. The Community Partner Resources Survey was a self-administered online survey of community organizations that aimed to describe population health resources within the five priority area categories of the NYSPA: chronic disease prevention; promoting a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants, and children; promoting well-being and preventing mental and substance use disorders; and prevention of communicable diseases.97 Within each priority area, the NYSPA identifies focus areas and goals. Organizations were asked to identify which focus areas and goals their programs and activities aim to achieve. For the purpose of this report, each focus area cited by a respondent organization is defined as a resource in that priority area. A free response option was provided to indicate a program/activity goal that may not be aligned with the NYSPA. The survey also collected information on populations served and current program status related to COVID-19 impacts. The survey was created using survey software, \u00a9 2021 Alchemer, and disseminated via email to a distribution list created from the Putnam County Department of Health (PCDOH) communications directory. Organizations recruited for participation included for-profit, not-for-profit, local government agencies, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), the local hospital center, and other healthcare and social services organizations. Respondent organizations met the following criteria for inclusion: location in Putnam County, primarily serve and offer programs and activities to Putnam County residents or have services and resources that are open to and are well-promoted to Putnam County residents. 74 organizations were solicited to complete the survey, including healthcare providing organizations (skilled nursing facilities, voluntary health organizations, FQHC, and the hospital), educational organizations, private sector businesses, local government agencies, and other non-profits (food pantries, professional associations, volunteer service organizations, public clinics, and social advocacy groups).98 32 of the solicited organizations completed the survey for a response rate of 43.24% MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 Services exist for all segments of the population amongst respondent organizations. Services for adults, the general population, and adolescent populations were most common. Services specifically for women, incarcerated or recently incarcerated, and men were least common. \u2022 To better understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of population health services, organizations were queried about the status of programs. No organizations responded that all programs are presently completely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 36% have all programs meeting in person at pre-pandemic frequency and attendance. However, 69% of respondents still have some programs meeting online rather than in person, 46% have some programs meeting in person at decreased frequency, and 41% are meeting in person with attendance limits. 97 New York State Department of Health, 2020, https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2019-2024/index.htm, accessed June 2022 98 Voluntary Health Organization are classified as an organization that a community member must go to voluntarily (without a court order, prescription, etc.) to receive treatment for their condition. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 152 \u2022 The focus areas with the most resources by priority area are: o Preventing Chronic Disease, 22 organizations with 45 resources \u25aa Healthy eating and food security, 16 resources, 36% o Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment, 8 organizations with 12 resources \u25aa Injuries, violence, and occupation health, 4 resources, 33% o Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children, 11 organizations with 19 resources \u25aa Child and adolescent health, 8 resources, 42% o Promote Well-being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders, 19 organizations with 30 resources \u25aa Promote well-being, 16 resources, 53% o Prevent Communicable Diseases, 11 organizations with 27 resources \u25aa Vaccine-preventable diseases, 10 resources 37% SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 The results of this survey are a necessary first step in identifying potential gaps in resources and should be used in tandem with other county-specific assessments, and the M-H Region Community Health Assessment (CHA). Follow up with partner organizations should aim to assess where additional capacity is needed. \u2022 Responses to questions regarding the status of population health programs indicate that while some programs have returned to their pre-pandemic status, in some cases changes made due to COVID-19 safety guidelines have endured beyond the end of mandates. Community organizations should continuously solicit feedback from their populations served to ensure that population health services are meeting their needs in their current form. \u2022 Perhaps the greatest utility of this survey will be to act as a directory of available resources during community health improvement planning to align health problems with appropriate organizations.

The Rockland County Department of Health distributed the regional provider survey via the listservs of both the Haverstraw and Spring Valley Collaboratives, as well as among active health improvement workgroups that are focused on school health, COVID-19 and 2022 polio outbreak response. Respondents included members of government agencies (RC Dept of Mental Health, RC Dept of Health, RC Dept of Social Services), health care organizations (Good Samaritan Hospital, Sun River Health, Fidelis Care), primary and secondary education (Rockland Community College, East Ramapo Central School District, Mount Saint Mary College), advocacy groups (Hudson Valley Community Services, NAACP, American Lung Association), religious groups (All Souls Community Church), non-profits (Hudson Valley Adoption Services, Meals on Wheels of Rockland, Regional Economic Community Action Program), and others. The results showed that the top three issues that affect health in Rockland County were [see Figure 145]: 1) Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing 2) Access to mental health providers 3) Access to affordable, nutritious food The survey also showed that the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Rockland County were [see Figure 146]: 1) Knowledge of existing resources 2) Drug and/or alcohol use 3) Health literacy Issues highly impacting health in the communities as listed by the providers include mental health and substance use issues, chronic diseases, and widening health disparities in some communities [see Figure 147]. The survey provided an opportunity for agency providers to expand upon these issues and barriers. Additionally, they were asked about how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the well-being of their clients and the effectiveness of the services they provide. MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 There is a lack of information being disseminated about public transportation services, and a transportation system that is limited and unreliable. \u2022 Not enough mental health providers or programs are available locally, and even fewer are offering critical services during evenings and weekends. \u2022 The lack of affordable housing in Rockland remains a serious concern. Large portions of residents may be spending over 50% of their income simply on housing. \u2022 Lack of cultural competency at all levels is acting as a barrier which is deterring vulnerable populations from seeking available services. \u2022 People within the LGBTQIA+ community often fear discrimination or erasure when accessing medical care which can be a deterrent to seeking care that contributes to higher rates of preventable illness. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 156 \u2022 Residents are unaware of the multiple community resources available in Rockland; improvements are needed in the marketing of current or future opportunities to increase awareness and program effectiveness. \u2022 Providers also struggle to maintain a current understanding of which resources are available for referral, which organizations still have funding, and the type of services are offered. \u2022 Health insurance is lacking in certain communities, which reduces access to care. Even Medicaid can be challenging because not all providers accept it, particularly mental health providers. \u2022 Health literacy is a growing issue in various communities. Some educational settings are resistant to comprehensive health education, particularly around issues like teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \u2022 Tailored outreach is needed to address issues among ethnic and religious cultures that are slow to accept or promote preventive medicine. \u2022 The undocumented face many difficulties in accessing clinical, mental health services and substance abuse services. \u2022 Overwhelmed providers are doing less to educate and empower patients by taking the time to explain health care diagnoses in an understandable fashion IMPACT OF COVID-19 \u2022 Since the beginning of 2020 there has been a noticeable decline in the number and availability of accessible health practitioners for clinical and mental health needs. Preventive service uptake fell off dramatically during the pandemic and now that COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted there is a noticeable increase in the detection of conditions that could have been identified early or avoided. \u2022 The pandemic forced all sectors of the community to offer remote options to conduct business. Health providers now rely heavily on virtual visits and patient portals which can be convenient for some but also create barriers for others. Providers mentioned that the lack of personal interaction has been detrimental to efforts to treat the whole person. It was further noted that not all residents have the means to utilize telehealth without internet access or proper equipment. \u2022 The intense focus on COVID-19 for more than two years allowed for an erosion of partnerships and networks that were dedicated to community health locally. Certain organizations were either closed or temporarily shuttered due to restricted funding and/or social distance regulations. There was also turn-over in staff at all levels, leaving a knowledge gap. At this time there are concerted efforts to rebuild and reinforce against the critical community-based infrastructure loss. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 The extreme pressure that the COVID-19 pandemic applied to public health services exacerbated the flaws and inadequacies that previously existed throughout the system. Now that gaps have been highlighted in critical support systems, they should be appropriately addressed to improve the health outcomes. \u2022 Telehealth options will only continue to expand, and assistance will be needed to reduce inequity and provide the associated technological requirements that allow access to services by all residents. \u2022 The dialogue around local inequities and the cooperative efforts of inter-agency collaborations should be enhanced moving forward to rebuild the staff and institutional knowledge losses experienced as a result of the pandemic. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 157 \u2022 Data should be collected on current local care usage and outcomes, which should be further stratified by race and ethnicity so that current issues can be identified and documented, since the public health data streams we typically rely on for assessment and improvement plans are consistently outdated by several years.

In addition, Sullivan County Public Health conducted several focus groups of community partners and residents. These focus groups were conducted with The Rural Health Network, Sullivan 180, Health Services Advisory Board, and community residents including two senior groups and a group conducted at the local community college. Many community partners participated in these focus groups to discuss the health concerns of Sullivan County. In the service providers survey, conducted through the M-H Community Partner Survey, 20 respondents completed the survey. These providers identified the following as the top three issues that affect the health of Sullivan County residents [see Figure 148]: 1) Access to mental health providers 2) Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing 3) Access to affordable, reliable public transportation The survey also identified that the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Sullivan County were [see Figure 149]: 1) Drug and/or alcohol use 2) Knowledge of existing resources 3) Geographic location \u2013 living in a rural area When asked about the impact of health issues in Sullivan County, the providers identified the following as having the biggest impact on the health of the community [see Figure 150]: 1) Mental health and substance use 2) Chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, asthma, obesity, etc.) 3) Maternal and child health issues An additional survey, administered by Garnet Health Systems Catskills, was completed by 17 health care providers. The results of this survey identified the top issues affecting health of Sullivan County residents as: 1) Access to medical providers 2) Access to mental health providers 3) Access to affordable, reliable transportation The top three barriers to people achieving better health in Sullivan County communities were identified as: 1) Geographic location \u2013 living in a rural area 2) Drug and/or alcohol use 3) Lack of health literacy and not having someone to help them understand their medical condition Other issues highly impacting health of communities in Sullivan County include health disparities and communicable diseases. The focus groups gave community partners a chance to expand upon these issues and barriers. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 160 MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 Lack of medical services and providers was an area of concern for focus group participants. Consolidation of medical providers into medical care organizations has left many rural areas of the county without basic medical access. Providers are leaving Sullivan County and access to specialty services requires travel out of county, which creates a barrier to access. Also, providers that remain in Sullivan County often have only have office hours during regular business hours. For those who may not be able to take time off from work, this makes accessing health care or well visits difficult. \u2022 Transportation is also another major barrier to accessing services. While \u201cMove Sullivan\u201d has increased transportation options to the major hubs of Sullivan County (Monticello, Liberty, Fallsburg), access to public transportation in the more rural areas of Sullivan County remains difficult. The rising cost of gas is also affecting the ability and willingness to drive to appointments and errands for everyday items. \u2022 The lack of affordable housing was identified by participants as a barrier to improving health in Sullivan County. Lack of affordable housing inventory due to population growth and the increasing cost of housing create economic strain for many residents. Along with the cost of housing, inflation is increasing the cost of healthy food, pharmaceuticals, health care products and services, and utilities, widening the financial and health disparity gaps already seen in Sullivan County. \u2022 High taxes, lack of return on investment from taxes, lack of good paying jobs, and a lack of educational opportunities were all identified as barriers to health equity and better health. \u2022 The increase in substance use, alcohol use, legalization of marijuana, suicide, and mental health issues were all identified by participants as concerns in Sullivan. \u2022 Difficulties in hiring and retaining staff was also identified by several community partners. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS \u2022 Improving communication between agencies and the community to improve the knowledge of resources available to the community and find solutions that are effective and efficient. \u2022 A single, umbrella agency to coordinate services for all residents. \u2022 Improved access to health care by having more providers with offices in Sullivan County, not just referral services to Orange County, as well as ensuring the local hospital remains open and offers more surgeries and procedures so residents do not have to travel. \u2022 The development of a cancer support group in Sullivan County.

The Ulster County Department of Health distributed a survey via the health and human services listservs as well as among members of the Healthy Ulster Council, which is a community meeting where organizations come together to build on existing strengths, share services with one another, and create an integrated system of chronic disease prevention. Many agencies were represented as respondents to the survey, the questions for which can be found in Appendix K. The survey results showed that the top three issues that affect health in Ulster County were [see Figure 151]: 1) Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing 2) Access to mental health providers 3) Access to affordable, reliable public transportation The survey also showed that the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Ulster County were [see Figure 152]: 1) Drug and/or alcohol use 2) Knowledge of existing resources 3) Geographic location \u2013 living in a rural area Issues highly impacting health in the communities, as listed by the providers include mental health and substance use issues, chronic diseases, and health disparities [see Figure 153]. The survey provided an opportunity for agency providers to expand upon these issues and barriers. MAJOR FINDINGS \u2022 Providers noted affordable housing is limited, and one respondent noted that accessible housing is severely limited. \u2022 Low availability of mental health services and providers was frequently cited, as well as lack of health literacy surrounding mental health and substance use, and clients\u2019 own mental health and substance use conditions preventing them from either knowing what resources are available or seeking help at all. \u2022 Lack of adequate means of transportation in Ulster County.

Those providers identified several issues that affect health in Westchester, including: \u2022 Access to affordable, decent, and safe housing \u2022 Access to mental health providers \u2022 Access to affordable, nutritious food \u2022 Access to affordable, reliable public transportation The respondents also acknowledged barriers to people achieving better health in Westchester County, among them, the top three includes: \u2022 Drug and/or alcohol use \u2022 Geographic location \u2013 living in a rural area \u2022 Having someone to help them understand their medical condition When asked about the issues impacting and/or highly impacting the health status in Westchester communities, these respondents suggested that chronic diseases (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, obesity, etc.), mental health and substance use issues, and health disparities are the top three issues currently affecting the communities. MAJOR FINDINGS Although an affluent county in general, there are pockets of neighborhoods in Westchester County where residents have limited access to affordable, decent, and safe housing, affordable nutritious food, and affordable and reliable public transportation. Such major socioeconomic disadvantages are major issues affecting people\u2019s health status. In addition to underservice due to major socioeconomic disadvantages, people living in rural areas could feel isolated and far away from easily accessible care. People from immigrant families, people with limited health care literacy, and people who have complicated health problems could encounter major difficulties while obtaining necessary care due to language barriers, the complexity of current health care and health insurance infrastructure, and/or the severity of their medical conditions. Another emerging and serious health issue is drug and/or alcohol use among residents, which was acknowledged among most of the providers who responded to the surveys. Substance use is not only a serious health problem among those who are suffering, it also burdens the already strained mental health care infrastructure and further increases the limitations of access to care. Over half of the respondents listed \u201caccess to mental health providers\u201d as a top-rated issue that affects health in Westchester, more than sixty percent of the respondents listed \u201cdrug and/or alcohol use\u201d as a top-rated barrier to achieving better health in the county, and almost ninety percent of the respondents identified \u201cmental health and substance use\u201d as one of the major issues impacting and/or highly impacting the health status of Westchester residents. Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey 167 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS Based on data collected from the 18 community care providers, three major areas need to be addressed in future health care and community services: 1) Mental health and substance use issues \u2013 88.2% listed it as one of the major issues impacting and/or highly impacting the health status of Westchester residents (with 58.8% listed it as highly impacting and 29.4% listed it as impacting) 2) Health disparities \u2013 81.3% listed it as one of the major issues impacting and/or highly impacting the health status of Westchester residents (with 50.0% listed it as highly impacting and 31.3% listed it as impacting) 3) Chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, asthma, obesity, etc.) \u2013 76.5% listed it as one of the major issues impacting and/or highly impacting the health status of Westchester residents (with 64.7% listed it as highly impacting and 11.8% listed it as impacting) Given the complexity of Westchester County\u2019s geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic compositions, a collection of 18 respondents from the large pool of health care and community service providers existing in the county can by no means present a thorough picture of current health status and service needs of people residing in Westchester. Therefore, the findings and recommendations presented in this section are suggestive and only shed some lights on the possibly more complicated issues to be addressed.

This global collaboration brings together various agencies, including but not limited to governments, civil society, academia, and private sector, to \u201cimprove the lives of older people, their families, and the communities in which they live.\u201d99 The UN Decade of Healthy Ageing initiative is intended to foster the health, well-being, and inclusion of older people everywhere. Older people\u2019s leadership is crucial to the initiative, and their voices must be uplifted by those around them, including caregivers, policy makers, and younger generations.100 \u201cNothing about us without us.\u201d -James Charlton As people live longer, society can benefit from older people\u2019s experience, wisdom, skills, and knowledge. The UN Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021-2030 initiative highlights four action areas including age-friendly environments, combating ageism, integrated care, and long-term care. Source: Decade of Healthy Ageing, The Platform, https://www.decadeofhealthyageing.org/home, accessed August 2022 AGE-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENTS Age-friendly environments can be achieved by constructing social and physical environments in ways that are conducive to the health of older people. In the previous Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Assessment 2019- 99 World Health Organization, UN Decade of Healthy Ageing, 2022, https://www.who.int/initiatives/decade-of-healthy-ageing, accessed August 2022 100 YouTube, Enabling Knowledge for Healthy Ageing: Launching the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing Platform, 2021, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIZJh9jpLFY&t=2127s, accessed August 2022 United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021-2030 170 2021, the Eight Domains of Livability created by WHO and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) were highlighted. The Eight Domains of Livability provided a framework on how to make communities livable for people of all ages. Domains included outdoor spaces and buildings; transportation, respect and social inclusion, housing, communication and information, civic participation and employment, community support and health services, and social participation.101 Key ways to make all communities age-friendly include ensuring outdoor spaces and buildings are safe, clean, and promote older people to pursue a more active lifestyle; providing ample transportation options, including public and community transportation for older populations to get to medical appointments and grocery stores; providing safe, affordable housing options for older populations; hosting age-friendly social, cultural and spiritual events for older people to participate in; involving older adults in the activities of the community, and socially engage them in a way where they are respected, included, and valued; offering a multitude of opportunities for older people to contribute to society after retirement, including volunteer and paid work, and remaining engaged in political processes;102 disseminating information through a variety of means that will reach all populations, including traditional print and broadcast methods; and securing accessible and affordable health care. COMBATING AGEISM Combating ageism is essential to ensuring healthy aging. Ageism is the discrimination of an individual or group based solely on their age.103 Older populations are more susceptible to the negative consequences of ageism.104 Ageism can affect how we think, feel, and act towards others and ourselves based on age and has the ability to impose powerful barriers to the development of good policies and programs for older and younger people.105 According to the Global Report on Ageism, ageism can be combatted through policy and law, educational activities, and intergenerational contact interventions.106 Policy and law can be used to address discrimination and inequality based on age and protect human rights. Educational activities help deliver knowledge and skills that enhance empathy towards others of all ages. Intergenerational contact interventions include direct and indirect contact between older and younger people, and research shows that \u201cintergenerational contact and educational interventions are among the most effective interventions for reducing ageism against older people.\u201d107 Refer to the Global Report on Ageism, linked in the footnotes, to learn more about combating ageism.

Declines of physical and mental capacities include \u201cvisual impairment, hearing loss, cognitive decline, malnutrition, mobility loss, depressive symptoms, urinary incontinence and falls.\u201d109 The key to supporting healthy aging for all is to enhance people\u2019s intrinsic capacity and functional ability, throughout all stages of life.110 Health services including prevention, promotion, end-of-life care, etc., should be accessible, especially financially, to older people, everywhere. Refer to the WHO ICOPE Handbook \u201cIntegrated care for older people (ICOPE): guidance for person-centered assessment and pathways in primary care,\u201d111 for information on how to implement ICOPE. LONG-TERM CARE The fourth UN Decade of Healthy Ageing action area is long-term care. Many older people experience substantial declines in physical and/or mental capacities and require additional support and assistance from others, such as family or caregivers. Older people deserve access to good-quality, long-term care in order to preserve their functional ability, live with dignity, and enjoy their basic human rights. Long-term care includes management of chronic geriatric conditions, rehabilitation, palliation, promotion and preventative services, and assistive care services such as caregiving and social support for older people.112 WHO has identified three approaches to assist countries in the development of long-term care programs that include: \u2022 \u201cEstablishing the foundations necessary for provision of long-term care as part of universal health coverage; \u2022 Building and maintaining a sustainable and appropriately trained workforce and supporting unpaid caregivers; and \u2022 Ensuring the quality of long-term care.\u201d113 The WHO Global Network on Long-term Care114 and The World Health Data on long-term care115 aim to support long-term care givers in creating improved long-term care systems. Aging is an inevitable and important process that should be celebrated in society. Healthy aging can be made possible through the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021-2030 initiative\u2019s four action areas: age-friendly environments, combating ageism, integrated care, and long-term care.

Adults also need at least two days of muscle-strengthening activities each week, such as lifting weights or doing pushups.116 Nearly 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Regular physical activity can improve both health and quality of life for people of all ages and abilities. Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of early death, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, falls, and depression.117 Healthy People 2030 has created objectives to reduce the proportion of adults who engage in no leisure time physical activity to 21.8%.118 NYS excluding NYC reached this target with 21.7% of adults not participating in leisure time physical activity within the past 30 days in 2018. Putnam County had the highest percentage of adults who participated in leisure time physical activity in the past 30 days (83.4%), while Sullivan had the lowest percentage (67.9%). The percentage of adults participating in leisure time physical activity has increased since 2013 for most counties and NYS excluding NYC and NYS, with the exception of Dutchess, Orange, and Sullivan Counties, which saw slight decreases [see Figure 157]. 116 Department of Health and Human Services, 2018, https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, accessed May 2022 117 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm, accessed October 2022 118 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/physical-activity, accessed May 2022 Health Behaviors Indicators 173 Figure 157 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS 2013-2014 81.3% 72.8% 80.7% 64.3% 75.1% 73.5% 78.3% 73.8% 72.9% 2016 74.7% 70.7% 75.0% 73.5% 72.4% 81.9% 77.1% 75.0% 74.0% 2018 80.2% 70.5% 83.4% 76.9% 67.9% 79.9% 81.6% 78.3% 76.4% Source: NYSDOH Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2018 https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-H/jsy7-eb4n/data 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 2013-2014 2016 2018 Percent Age-Adjusted Percent of Adults Who Participated in Leisure Time Physical Activity in the Past 30 Days, 2013-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Behaviors Indicators 174 NUTRITION FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION Nutrition has a significant impact on health, and diet is one of the most powerful tools utilized to prevent and reduce the burden of diseases, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends following a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan, focusing on variety, nutrient density, and amount of food; limiting calories from added sugars and saturated fats; reducing sodium intake; shifting to healthier food and beverage choices; and supporting healthy eating patterns for all.119 To meet these guidelines, it is important that fruits and vegetables are accessible and affordable. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults consume 1.5-2 cups of fruit and 2-3 cups of vegetables a day, yet only one in ten United States (US) adults eat this recommended amount of fruits or vegetables.120 In 2018, 25.8% of adults in the M-H Region reported eating less than one fruit and less than one vegetable daily, which is lower than the percentage in New York State (NYS) (28.1%). Putnam County had the lowest percentage of adults who reported consuming less than one fruit and less than one vegetable a day (22.9%) and saw a decrease from 2016, while Rockland had the highest percentage (28.5%). Dutchess, Rockland, and Ulster Counties were the only counties that had an increase from 2016 to 2018, while all other counties, as well as the M-H Region, NYS, and NYS excluding NYC, had a decrease [see Figure 158].

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to metabolic syndrome, cavities, and type 2 diabetes in adults. Foods and beverages high in calories from added sugar often provide few or no essential nutrients or dietary fiber, which therefore contribute to excess calorie intake without contributing to diet quality.121 Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages should be limited in a varied, healthy diet. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests reducing added sugars in the diet by reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. This can be accomplished by choosing beverages with no added sugars, reducing portions of sugar-sweetened beverages, drinking these beverages less often, and selecting beverages low in added sugars. In place of sugar-sweetened beverages, low-fat or fat-free milk or 100% fruit or vegetable juice can also be consumed within recommended amounts.122 According to the NYS Department of Health (DOH), Americans consume an average of 138 calories from sugary beverages on a given day. In NYS, more than one in five adults drank at least one sugar-sweetened beverage daily in 2018.123 This was highest in Sullivan and Putnam Counties (31.5% and 25.6%, respectively), while Rockland had the lowest percentage of adults who consumed one or more sugary drinks daily (18.1%). In the M-H Region, 22.3% of people consumed one or more sugary beverages daily. From 2013 to 2016, Dutchess, Putnam, Sullivan, and Westchester Counties saw slight increases in the percentage of adults who consumed one or more sugary beverages daily, while Orange, Rockland, and Ulster saw slight decreases [see Figure 159]. 121 Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/sugar-sweetened-beverages-intake.html, accessed May 2022 122 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, US Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, 2020, https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf, accessed September 2022 123 New York State Department of Health, 2018, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/reports/docs/2002_sugar_sweetened_beverages.pdf, accessed May 2022 Health Behaviors Indicators 176 Figure 159 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS 2013-2014 20.9% 26.5% 21.6% 19.5% 27.2% 30.6% 18.1% 24.7% 24.7% 2016 21.9% 25.5% 22.9% 23.1% 27.0% 23.6% 18.5% 24.6% 24.2% 2018 23.5% 22.5% 25.6% 18.1% 31.5% 23.5% 20.3% 25.5% 24.7% Source: NYSDOH Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2018 https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-H/jsy7-eb4n/data 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 2013-2014 2016 2018 Percent Age-Adjusted Percent of Adults Who Consume One or More Sugary Beverages Daily, 2013-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 177 HEALTH INDICATORS MORTALITY Before discussing the different health indicators in the M-H Region, it is useful to have an overall sense of the burden of diseases facing residents in these seven counties. Morbidity measures illness and it is defined in terms of incidence or prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases of a disease divided by the number of people at risk for the disease over a particular period of time. Prevalence is the total number of cases of disease existing in a population during a specific period of time or at a particular time point. Mortality is another term for death. A mortality rate is the number of deaths due to a disease during a particular period of time divided by the total population. Table 37 lists the top five causes of mortality in the M-H Region counties, as well as NYS and NYS excluding New York City (NYC). In 2019, Sullivan County had the highest total mortality rate out of all seven counties in the M-H Region, as well as NYS (790.3 per 100,000 population). In 2019, the leading cause of death in most of the M-H Region counties and NYS was heart disease, with the exception of Sullivan County, where cancer was the primary cause of death. The causes of death in most of the counties included heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD), and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). However, in Orange County, the fifth leading cause of death was Alzheimer\u2019s disease; in Sullivan County, the fifth leading cause of death was diabetes.

For some indicators at the county level, three-year averages were used due to greater stability of data. If a single year is posted for a three-year average, the years averaged include the year preceding and year following. For example, if the single year written is 2008, the three-year average would be from 2007-2009. Additionally, there are indicators derived from Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) where data from 2016 forward cannot be compared to data prior to 2014 and data is absent for 2015. According to the NYSDOH, this is due to SPARCS data transitioning on October 1, 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes. Since ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM are not comparable, an annual rate for 2015 cannot be calculated and data for 2016-and-forward should not be compared with data for 2014-and-prior. PHYSICAL HEALTH CHRONIC DISEASES CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASES CLRD is a classification of diseases that affect the lungs and the respiratory tract. Some of these diseases include asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. CLRD was the fourth leading cause of death in the US in 2019.124 Annual CLRD hospitalization rates decreased in NYS and NYS excluding NYC from 2016 to 2018. Three-year average CLRD hospitalization rates also decreased in almost all counties in 2018 as compared to the three-year average rates for 2017. This is excluding Sullivan County, which had a slight increase from 2017 to 2018 (27.3 vs 27.8 per 10,000 population, respectively), as seen in Figure 160. 124 JAMA Network, 2021, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2786682, accessed June 2022 Health Indicators 180 Figure 160 Note: The rate for 2015 is excluded due to SPARCS data transitioning on October 1, 2015 from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes.

The causes of asthma are not fully known; however, it is linked to a variety of factors that may be genetic, environmental, or viral. Other factors associated with higher asthma risk include allergies, obesity, occupation, and race. African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at a higher risk of asthma than other races and ethnicities.125 There is no definitive cure for the disease; however, there are ways to manage it with medication and by avoiding triggers, such as allergens, intense physical activity, emotional stress, and air pollution.126 Asthma is a serious economic burden, costing the US $50 billion a year in healthcare costs alone.127 In the US, 7.7% of adults have asthma.128 In 2018, this percentage varied across the seven counties in the M-H Region. According to Figure 166, Sullivan County had the highest percentage of adults with asthma (12.7%), while Rockland County had the lowest percentage (7.3%). Since 2013, Dutchess, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester Counties have had increases in the percentage of adults with asthma, while Orange, Putnam, and Rockland have had decreases. The percentages in NYS and NYS excluding NYC have stayed relatively stable.

The management, treatment, and lost productivity due to CVD cost the US about $229 billion each year from 2017 to 2018.130 Key risk factors for CVD include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use.131 A growing body of research is showing an association between mental health and heart disease through both behavioral and physiologic pathways.132 According to Figure 173, in 2018, Sullivan County had the highest percentage of adults with CVD (limited to heart attack, coronary artery disease, and stroke) at 8.6%, which is higher than the M-H Region at 6.6% and NYS at 7.0%. Putnam and Ulster Counties had the lowest percentage of adults with CVD in 4.5% and 4.6% of adults, respectively. Ulster and Westchester Counties saw decreases from 2016 to 2018 in the percentage of adults with cardiovascular disease, while all other counties, as well as the M-H Region and NYS excluding NYC, had increases.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against the arteries becomes high enough to cause diseases such as CVD. It is calculated based on the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats (systolic pressure) and the pressure in the arteries between heart beats (diastolic pressure).133 Hypertension is defined as having a systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure greater than 80 mmHg (or being on medication for hypertension). Almost half of adults in the US (47%) have hypertension, and less than a quarter of those (24%) have their hypertension under control.134 It is important to control hypertension through lifestyle modifications, as well as regular checkups with a doctor. The Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action to Control Hypertension seeks to target hypertension and its health effects from multiple settings across the US. Sectors included in the Call to Action include the federal government, state, and local governments; health care professionals; employers; and several others.135 133 Mayo Clinic, 2022, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410, accessed June 2022 134 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm, accessed June 2022 135 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/CTAstrategies.htm, accessed June 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 202.5 197.7 188.1 174.5 206.0 207.0 175.9 186.2 210.8 0 50 100 150 200 250 Rate per 100,000 Age-Adjusted Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 197 As shown in Figure 178, in 2016, the age-adjusted percentage of adults with physician-diagnosed hypertension was relatively consistent across the seven counties in the M-H Region.

CORONARY HEART DISEASE In the US, CHD, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD), is the most common type of CVD. It is caused by a buildup of plaque, which are deposits made up of substances such as fat, cholesterol, and calcium, in the arteries.136 This can result in angina (chest pain) that usually occurs in the middle or left side of chest.137 Complete blockage of arteries can lead to a heart attack. However, much can be done to prevent and treat this disease, such as adopting a healthier lifestyle (dietary behaviors, physical activity, reduced or termination of tobacco use) and following up regularly with a medical provider to control conditions that can increase the risk of CHD (high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes). 136 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/coronary_ad.htm, accessed September 2022 137 Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613, accessed September 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 1008.6 969.4 859.3 728.5 1658.5 1047.6 865.6 923.9 1040.6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Rate per 10,000 Hypertension Without Heart Failure Emergency Department Visit Rate per 10,000 (Any Diagnosis) - Aged 18 Years and Older, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 202 When looking at hospitalization rates of CHD from 2011-2013, rates have steadily decreased over time.

During a heart attack, part of the heart muscle does not receive enough blood flow and the more time that passes, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.138 Heart attacks may also be caused by a spasm of the coronary artery that may be induced by tobacco and illicit drug use. In the US, 790,000 Americans have a heart attack ever year and one in five of these heart attacks were silent.139 Men aged 45 years and older and women aged 55 years and older are more likely to have heart attacks compared to other age groups.140 The five major symptoms of a heart attack include pain in the jaw, neck, back, arms, or shoulders; feeling weak or fatigued; chest pain; and shortness of breath.141 138 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm, accessed September 2022 139 1MD Nutrition, 2021, https://1md.org/health-guide/heart/disorders/heart-attack#:~:text=%E2%99%A6%20It%20is%20estimated%20that%20a%20heart%20attack,%28damage%20is%20done%2C%20but%20the%20 person%20is%20unaware%29., accessed September 2022 140 Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106, accessed September 2022 141 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm, accessed September 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 118.8 104.5 114.6 101.5 113.4 98.5 100.5 104.6 131.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Rate per 100,000 Age-Adjusted Coronary Heart Disease Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 206 As seen in Figure 187, while a majority of the heart attack hospitalization rates in the M-H Region have slightly fluctuated from 2011-2018, Sullivan County saw a slight increase following 2012.

There are three main types of stroke: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attack (TIA).142 Ischemic stroke occurs when blood clots or plaques block the blood vessels to the brain, causing the brain to receive decreased oxygen. Almost 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel bursts inside the brain and the blood building up in the tissues causes severe damage. A TIA, which is also called a mini-stroke, occurs when blood flow is blocked to the brain for a short period of time, usually five minutes or less. More than a third of people who have a TIA and do not receive treatment have a major stroke within one year of the TIA.143 It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of a stroke in order for action to be taken quickly. Signs of a stroke include numbness in the face or extremities, often on one side of the body; confusion or difficulty speaking; vision problems; loss of balance or lack of coordination; or a severe headache.144 Some risk factors for a stroke include lifestyle behaviors (unhealthy diet, decreased physical activity, use of illicit drugs); cigarette smoking; medical conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, other types of CVDs, and family history; and being aged 55 years and older.145 142 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/types_of_stroke.htm, accessed June 2022 143 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/types_of_stroke.htm, accessed June 2022 144 Mayo Clinic, 2022, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113, accessed June 2022 145 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/risk_factors.htm, accessed September 2022 Health Indicators 213 According to Figure 193, stroke hospitalization rates from 2017 to 2018 have generally remained stable in the M-H Region, NYS, and NYS excluding NYC.

Diabetes can be classified into two primary forms: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, known as type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, known as type 2 diabetes (T2DM). T1DM occurs when the body attacks itself and does not make enough insulin, which is a hormone released from the pancreas to help break down glucose. Alternatively, T2DM occurs when the body is unable to use existing insulin to help control the amount of glucose released into the blood stream. According to the CDC, about 90% of people with diabetes have T2DM.147 Before people are diagnosed with diabetes, they are usually tested for prediabetes, which is when a person\u2019s blood sugar level is higher than normal, thereby putting them at a greater risk of developing diabetes. According to the NYSDOH, 15-30% of the population in NYS with prediabetes will develop T2DM within five years if they do not change their lifestyle behaviors.148 146 New York State Department of Health, 2020, https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/conditions/diabetes/, accessed July 2022 147 Center of Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html, accessed July 2022 148 New York State Department of Health, 2020, https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/conditions/diabetes/, accessed July 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 13.9 18.1 13.9 13.1 16.2 16.4 9.4 12.6 11.1 0 5 10 15 20 25 Rate per 100,000 Age-Adjusted Congestive Heart Failure Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 224 Figure 204 shows that within the M-H Region in 2018, 11.2% of adults were diagnosed with prediabetes by a physician, which is higher than the percentages in NYS and NYS excluding NYC (10.8% and 9.3%, respectively). Sullivan County had the highest percentage of the population diagnosed with prediabetes at 16.2% and Putnam County had the lowest percentage diagnosed at 6.1%. According to the US Diabetes Surveillance System (USDSS), 11.3% of the US population aged 18 years and older was diagnosed with diabetes in 2019.149 This is higher than the percentages in both NYS excluding NYC (9.2%) and in NYS (10.0%). In the M-H Region, 8.6% of the population was diagnosed with diabetes, with the highest percentage seen in Orange County at 8.5%. The percentages used are age-adjusted percentages.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a screening tool used to measure weight to height ratio that can determine if individuals have a healthy weight for their height. The calculation consists of person\u2019s weight in kilograms divided by his/her height in meters squared. If individuals have a BMI between 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2, they are considered to be overweight and if they have a BMI of 30.0 or higher, they are considered to be obese.151 Of the seven counties in the M-H Region, in 2018 Sullivan County has the highest percentage of adults who are overweight or obese (69.9%) and Rockland County has the lowest percentage (59.4%). The combined prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the M-H Region (61.4%) was lower than the percentage for NYS and NYS excluding NYC (62.5% and 64.4%, respectively). Since 2013, Putnam, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester Counties, as well as NYS and NYS excluding NYC had increases in the percentage of adults who are overweight or obese [see Figure 212].

For instance, those who are obese are at a greater risk of developing other conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, cancer, and renal failure.152 Eating food high in sugar and fat content and having decreased physical activity can increase the risk of obesity. However, there are also multiple environmental, behavioral, and emotional factors that contribute to this disease, including stress. Stress has an indirect effect on obesity, as it can lead to increased food consumption, increased alcohol intake, and pursuing a less active lifestyle, which can all result in increased weight gain.153 Recent data shows that more than one third of adults in the US are obese.154 When comparing data from 2016 to 2018, there were slight changes in the percentage of the population that is obese in each M-H Region county [see Figure 213]. Most counties experienced an increase in the percentage of the population that is obese, while some experienced a decrease in rates, including Orange (29.7% to 24.3%) and Ulster (31.8% to 28.0%) Counties. In 2018, Sullivan County had the highest obesity rate across the seven counties at 38.9%, which was above the M-H Region, NYS, and NYS excluding NYC rates (25.3%, 27.9%, and 29.7%, respectively).

When looking at the combined prevalence of being overweight and obesity among school-aged children from 2010-2018, the trend differs in each county. In Dutchess and Sullivan Counties, there was a slight decrease, although Sullivan and Ulster Counties had the highest percentage of students who were overweight or obese compared to the other M-H Region counties and NYS excluding NYC [see Figure 214].

The scar tissue replaces the healthy tissue preventing the liver from working normally. It can eventually lead to liver failure. The common causes of cirrhosis include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis C, and chronic hepatitis B.155 There can be many symptoms of cirrhosis including fatigue, weight loss, and poor appetite, while later stage symptoms can include bruising easily, edema, and jaundice. Symptoms may not appear until the liver is badly damaged.156 Between 2017 and 2018, cirrhosis hospitalization rates had a slight increase across NYS, NYS excluding NYC, and most counties in the M-H Region. However, Putnam and Rockland Counties had slight decreases in cirrhosis hospitalization rates [see Figure 217].

Cancer can metastasize, or spread, from one part of the body to another.157 There are a variety of risk factors, including genetics, the environment, and health behaviors. These behaviors include smoking, drinking alcohol, diet, and physical activity. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death across all seven counties in the M-H Region. From 2016-2018, incidence rates were relatively similar across the seven counties in the M-H Region, as well as NYS [see Figure 221]. Orange County had the highest incidence rate and the highest mortality rate in the M-H Region (484.5 and 192.4 per 100,000, respectively).

Some symptoms include blood in the stool, abdominal pains or aches, fatigue, and abnormal weight loss.159 However, colorectal cancer does not always cause symptoms. Polyps, which are abnormal growths, can form in the colon or rectum. Polyps may turn into cancer over time; however, they can be found through screening tests and removed.160 Of the seven counties in the M-H Region, Sullivan County had the highest colorectal cancer incidence rate and mortality rate (40.8 and 13.1 per 100,000 population, respectively) [see Figure 225]. In the US, the rate of new colorectal cancer cases in 2019 was 36.3 per 100,000 population, while the mortality rate due to colorectal cancer was 12.8 per 100,000 population.161 Figure 225 Note: Trend data for incidence and mortality rates can be found on NYS Community Health Indicator Reports (CHIRS).

Some screening tests include colonoscopy; guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), which uses a chemical called guaiac to detect blood in the stool; or a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which uses antibodies to look for blood in the stool.162 The New York State Prevention Agenda (NYSPA) aims to have the percentage of adults aged 50 to 64 years who receive a colorectal cancer screening based on recent guidelines to be 66.3%. The M-H Region fell below this target, with 64.1% of adults aged 50 to 64 years receiving a colorectal cancer screening test based on the most recent guidelines in 2018 [see Figure 228]. Putnam, Ulster, and Westchester Counties were the counties in the region that met or exceeded the NYSPA target. Dutchess and Orange Counties saw decreases in the percent of adults aged 50 to 64 years receiving a colorectal cancer screening based on the most recent guidelines from 2016 to 2018, while all other counties, as well as the M-H Region, NYS excluding NYC, and NYS, had increases.

Some symptoms of lung cancer include chest pain, coughing (sometimes with blood), shortness of breath, and/or wheezing. The leading risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco use. According to the NYSDOH, smoking is responsible for over 80% of lung cancers.163 Another risk factor for lung cancer is radon exposure. Radon is a colorless, radioactive gas that comes from the decay of elements such as uranium, which is found in soil and 162 US Preventive Services Task Force, 2021, https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening#tab1, accessed June 2022 163 New York State Department of Health, 2018, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/abouts/lung.htm, accessed July 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS excl NYC NYS 2016 62.2% 68.8% 64.7% 61.9% 48.1% 60.2% 63.7% 63.3% 63.7% 63.1% 2018 60.6% 61.7% 86.3% 62.3% 58.8% 68.8% 70.0% 64.1% 66.5% 65.4% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Percent Percent of Adults Aged 50-64 Years Who Received a Colorectal Cancer Screening Based on the Most Recent Guidelines, 2016-2018 * * * * * Health Indicators 248 rock.164 Radon is in the surrounding air, so it is not possible to completely avoid it.

Prostate cancer has a better prognosis compared to other cancers when people receive treatment early. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test measures the level of PSA in the blood, which is a substance created in the prostate. When PSA levels are high, this most likely means there is a problem with the prostate. It is important for men to begin being tested at a younger age in order to prevent future complications. When looking at Figure 232, the highest rate of prostate cancer incidence was seen in Westchester County and the lowest incidence rate was seen in Sullivan County (137.5 and 86.3 per 100,000 males, respectively). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce prostate cancer mortality to 21.8 deaths per 100,000 males. According to Figure 232, the counties in the M-H Region, as well as NYS and NYS excluding NYC, met this target. Orange County had the highest rate of prostate cancer mortality in the M-H Region but was still under this target (21.4 per 100,000 males).

One of the most important screening tests for breast cancer is a mammogram, which is an X-ray picture of the breast that should be routinely administered to women aged 40 years and older.167 The Healthy People 2020 goal was to have at least 81.1% of the female population receive a breast cancer screening based on the most recent guidelines. However, as seen in Figure 234, in 2018 all of the counties in the M-H Region, as well as NYS excluding NYC, failed to meet this target. NYS was the only location to meet this target at 82.1%.

There are no early signs or symptoms for this disease, but advanced cervical cancer can lead to symptoms of abnormal bleeding and discharge from the vagina. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of most cervical cancer. Other risk factors include having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), smoking, using birth control pills for five years or more, and having given birth to three or more children. Cervical cancer can be screened for with a pap test starting at the age of 21 years.168 Other gynecological cancers include ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. While cervical cancer can be screened for, other gynecological cancers do not have screening tests to identify them early, so it is important to recognize warning signs and symptoms and to seek treatment.169 168 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm, accessed June 2022 169 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/gynecologic/basic_info/prevention.htm, accessed June 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2013-2014 2016 2018 Percent Percent of Women Aged 50-74 Years Receiving Breast Cancer Screening Based on the Most Recent Guidelines, 2013-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 254 When looking at the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer in Figure 235, the highest incidence rate was in Orange County at 10.8 per 100,000 females and the lowest was in Rockland County at 5.1 per 100,000 females.

Life expectancy increased in the 20th century due largely to reductions in deaths caused by infectious diseases where vaccines were available. Despite these improvements, people in the US continue to get preventable diseases. Approximately 42,000 adults and 300 children in the US die each year from vaccine preventable diseases.171 Communities with unimmunized populations are at an increased risk for outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine childhood vaccination by two years of age. The combined 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 vaccine series consists of four doses of diptheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); three polio; one measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); three haemophilus influenza (Hib); three hepatitis B (HepB); one varicella; and four pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) vaccines. Appropriate vaccination coverage is linked to improved health outcomes and cost savings. Complying with age-appropriate receipt of vaccines is critical in providing maximum effectiveness against vaccine preventable diseases. The Healthy People 2020 Immunization and Infectious Disease goals set a target that 80% of children should receive all doses in the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series by age 19-35 months to achieve and maintain effective vaccination coverage levels for universally recommended vaccines among children. NYSPA 2024 set a goal that 70.5% of the 24- to 35-month-old population complete the series. While coverage had generally been trending upwards, it remained suboptimal in the M-H Region for 2020 with a 55.5% coverage overall [see Figure 238]. Dutchess and Ulster Counties performed the best at 66.8% and 66.5% respectively, while Rockland and Orange Counties had the lowest coverage at 42.9% and 45.4%, respectively [see Figure 237].

The CDC reported the first positive laboratory confirmed case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the US on January 20, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the officially WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.173 Towards the beginning of the pandemic, the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases caused shortages of several resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, hospital beds, body bags, and blood. The pandemic also led to widespread shutdowns of schools, workplaces, businesses, and public gatherings.

Available COVID-19 data reflected these disparities in positivity rates, case numbers, hospitalizations, and fatalities. Nationwide, for example, non-Hispanic Black individuals and Hispanic individuals were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 than non-Hispanic White individuals.174 In the M-H Region, non-Hispanic Black individuals generally had a higher rate of hospitalization than any other race or ethnicity category over the course of the pandemic [see Figure 246]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is continuously branching out genetically into what are known as variants. Different variants can have different attributes that can affect transmission, illness severity, treatment, and vaccine resistance. Some variants that gained prominence at different points in the pandemic include the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants.175 The CDC defines three transmission periods over the course of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US: the Winter 2020-21 Period (December 1, 2020\u2013February 28, 2021), the Delta Period (July 15\u2013October 31, 2021), and the Omicron Period (December 19, 2021\u2013January 15, 2022).176 The M-H Region and all seven counties within, as well as NYS excluding NYC, all experienced their highest COVID-19 case rate peaks during the Omicron Period in January of 2022. Of the seven Mid-Hudson counties, Sullivan County had the highest peak daily case rate during this period at 217.28 per 100,000 population, while Ulster County had the lowest peak daily case rate at 129.45 per 100,000 population [see Figure 239].

When initially offered, vaccine uptake across the counties in the Mid-Hudson Region was hindered by availability of doses. By end of June 2021, just over half of the entire population in the Region had a complete COVID-19 vaccination series [see Figure 243]. Between July and December 2021, completed series coverage rates rose an average of 21% across the Region. Vaccine uptake slowed in 2022 and has remained static since Spring 2022.

In the US in 2018 there were an estimated 43 million people living with HPV infections. Each year approximately 13 million more Americans become infected with the virus, including adolescents.185 HPV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus, even if they have no symptoms. Anyone who is sexually active is at risk for HPV and symptoms may not develop until years after exposure. While HPV can often go away on its own without causing any health problems, it can lead to conditions such as genital warts and cervical cancer. There is no way to know which people with HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adolescents aged 11-12 years get two doses of HPV vaccine to protect against cancers caused by HPV. Other actions individuals can take to lower their risk of HPV include screening for cervical cancer, using latex condoms during sex, and limiting number of sexual partners. For more information on cervical cancer, see page 253. The NYSPA 2019-2024 target aims to increase the percentage of 13-year-old adolescents completing the HPV vaccine series by 10%, which translates to 37.4% state wide.186 Westchester County had the highest percentage 185 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/about-hpv.html#:~:text=HPV%20infections%20are%20common&text=More%20than%2042%20million%20Americans,teens%2C%20become%20infected %20each%20year, accessed August 2022 186 New York State Department of Health, 2021, https://health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2019-2024/comm.htm, accessed October 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Mar 2020 Apr 2020 May 2020 Jun 2020 Jul 2020 Aug 2020 Sep 2020 Oct 2020 Nov 2020 Dec 2020 Jan 2021 Feb 2021 Mar 2021 Apr 2021 May 2021 Jun 2021 Jul 2021 Aug 2021 Sep 2021 Oct 2021 Nov 2021 Dec 2021 Jan 2022 Feb 2022 Mar 2022 Apr 2022 May 2022 Jun 2022 Jul 2022 Aug 2022 Percent Percent of Hospital Beds Occupied by COVID-19 Patients, March 2020-August 2022 Mid-Hudson All Beds Mid-Hudson ICU Beds NYS excl NYC All Beds NYS excl NYC ICU Beds Health Indicators 267 of adolescents aged 13 years who received two or more doses of the HPV vaccines (33.1%), while Ulster County had the lowest percentage (21.3%) [see Figure 248].

The overall percentage of adolescents who completed the HPV series in the M-H Region, at 27.5%, is still well below the current NYS target. It is important to note that in the previous M-H Region CHA (2019-2022), this measure focused solely on the completion rates for females aged 13-17 years. Since that time, NYS has revised the objective to include all adolescents completing the series at age 13 and as a result trend analysis is not available.

Severe illness from flu can result in hospitalization or even death. Certain populations are at a higher risk of complications from the flu virus, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to help protect against flu. Vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of flu, hospitalizations, and risk of flu-related death in children.187 ACIP recommends that everyone six months of age and older receive a flu vaccine every flu season.188 Healthy People 2030 set a target to increase the percentage of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years and older who are vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza to 70%.189 In 2018, 26.9% of adults aged 18 years and older received a flu vaccine in NYS. Westchester County had the highest percentage of adults vaccinated (29.5%), while Dutchess County had the lowest coverage (22.4%). The percentage of adults aged 18 years and older who received a flu vaccine has decreased since 2013 in all seven counties, as well as NYS excluding NYC and NYS [see Figure 250].

Pneumococcal bacteria are spread through droplets in the air from someone who coughs or sneezes. While pneumococcal disease is more common in children, it is more likely to cause serious complications in adults.190 Healthy choices, such as giving up smoking and managing chronic illnesses, can also help prevent pneumonia. The CDC recommends two pneumococcal vaccines for adults aged 65 years and older. Healthy People 2020 aimed to increase the percentage of noninstitutionalized adults aged 65 years and older who are vaccinated against pneumococcal disease to 90.0%. NYS did not reach this goal, nor did the counties in the M-H Region. Dutchess County had the highest percentage (75.0%), while Ulster County had the lowest coverage (61.7%). From 2013 to 2018, Dutchess and Rockland Counties saw significant increases in the percent of adults aged 65 years and older who received the pneumococcal vaccine (65.9% in 2013 vs 75.0% in 2018 and 54.1% in 2013 vs 66.4% in 2018, respectively), while all other counties, as well as NYS excluding NYC and NYS, remained stable [see Figure 252].

At the end of 2019, the CDC estimated that approximately 1.2 million people aged 13 years and older in the US had HIV; about 13% of the individuals infected with HIV were not diagnosed. HIV is primarily transmitted through bodily fluid transmission, with the highest proportion of cases in 2019 transmitted through male-to-male sexual contact (65.6%) and heterosexual contact (23.5%). HIV can also be transmitted through injected drug use and this risk factor was present in approximately 10% of new HIV diagnoses. There are gender, age, race, and ethnicity disparities in new HIV diagnoses. In 2019, HIV incidence was five times higher in males than females, high in Blacks and Hispanics, and highest in persons aged 25-34 years.191 While there is no effective cure for HIV, it can be controlled, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the final stage of HIV, can be prevented if people know they are infected and receive treatment. The CDC encourages everyone aged 13-64 years to be tested at least once as part of routine healthcare and for those with higher risk to be tested more often. HIV/AIDS infections remain a significant public health issue in NYS and the US; HIV is preventable. Those who are confirmed positive after testing for HIV can make behavioral changes to decrease the risk of transmitting it to their sexual or drug-using partner. Healthy People 2030 aims to reduce the number of new HIV diagnoses in the US by 90% through continuing national education programs, policies, regulations, and laws.192 NYS is currently fifth in the top 10 states with the highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in adolescents. From 2017 to 2019, Westchester (10.1 per 100,000), Rockland (8.5 per 100,000), and Orange (7.5 per 100,000) had the highest age-adjusted rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections, while Putnam had the lowest (4.3 per 100,000). The M-H Region\u2019s age-adjusted rate (8.1 per 100,000) was lower than the rate for NYS, which was 13.2 per 100,000 [see Figure 253]. 191 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Estimated HIV Incidence and Prevalence in the United States, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-supplemental-report-vol-26-1.pdf, accessed May 2022 192 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/sexually-transmitted-infections/reduce-number-new-hiv-infections-hiv-01, accessed April 2022 Health Indicators 273 Figure 253 Source: NYSDOH Community Health Indicator Reports (CHIRS), 2020 https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&p=it&ind_id= Gg43a Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 5.8 7.5 4.3 8.5 5.2 5.6 10.1 8.1 13.2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Rate per 100,000 Age-Adjusted Newly Diagnosed HIV Case Rate per 100,000, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 274 HIV incidence rates have decreased from 2011 to 2018 in NYS and NYS excluding NYC.

Infection in the genitals, urethra, rectum, and throat occurs through contact with the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae during vaginal, anal, or oral sexual activity with an infected partner. Pregnant persons can also pass a gonorrhea infection to babies during childbirth. Gonorrhea is most common among young people aged 15-24 years.193 The NYSPA 193 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/std/ff/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm, accessed October 2022 0 5 10 15 20 25 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Rate per 100,000 Age-Adjusted Newly Diagnosed HIV Case Rate per 100,000, 2011-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Three-Year Average Single-Year Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS 2011 6.8 7.3 4.4 8.7 7.2 4.8 12.2 8.0 19.9 2012 7.9 5.4 4.4 9.2 7.5 4.7 11.2 7.3 18.6 2013 8.2 4.4 4.9 9.5 7.8 4.5 11.7 7.0 17.3 2014 7.2 3.5 4.7 8.5 8.5 5.4 11.1 7.8 17.5 2015 7.3 5.1 3.6* 8.2 9.6 4.9 114 6.8 16.3 2016 5.8 6.3 3.0* 7.5 6.7 4.4 11.4 7.0 15.0 2017 5.9 7.6 3.3* 8.7 6.1 5.7 10.8 6.7 14.5 2018 5.8 7.5 4.3 8.5 5.2 5.6 10.1 5.6 12.8 Health Indicators 275 aims to decrease the annual growth rate of new gonorrhea diagnoses by 50% to 4% through promoting regulations, education, and testing for females younger than 25 years of age and those with risk factors such as multiple partners or a sexual partner that has a sexually transmitted infection.193,194 These practices aim to provide access to affordable, culturally sensitive, and convenient STI testing and treatment services. Figure 255 shows the incidence rate of gonorrhea from 2017 to 2019 by sex in persons aged 15-44 years. Incidence was consistently higher in males than females in all counties other than Sullivan. The highest rate was seen in males in Westchester County (257.4 per 100,00). Sullivan, Orange, and Ulster Counties have the highest rates of gonorrhea infections in females (174.4, 152.0, and 139.3 per 100,000, respectively), while Putnam County case rates were the lowest for both sexes. NYS surpassed all counties in the M-H Region for both male and female infections.

Figure 260 Source: Office of Sexual Health and Epidemiology, 2017-2019 https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/std/index.htm CHLAMYDIA Chlamydia is a common STI that can infect people of all genders. Chlamydia is spread with an infected partner via vaginal, anal, or oral sexual activity. If someone has been treated for chlamydia in the past, they could still become infected again through unprotected sex with the same individual or another person who has chlamydia. Pregnant persons can also pass chlamydia to their babies during childbirth.195 Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial infection in the US, with the highest prevalence among persons aged 24 years and younger. Like gonorrhea, if left untreated in females, chlamydia can also lead to serious sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Asymptomatic infection is common; the CDC and the NYSPA recommend screening annually in sexually active females aged 25 years and younger and females aged 25 years and older with increased risk for infection (if they have a new sex partner, multiple or concurrent sexual partners, or a partner(s) who has an STI).196 195 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm, accessed May 2022 196 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/chlamydia.htm, accessed May 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester 2018 180 241 23 109 36 98 765 2019 210 288 30 140 46 115 906 2020 300 397 31 114 108 149 1017 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Case Count Total Reported Gonorrhea Cases, 2018-2020 Health Indicators 281 From 2017 to 2019, chlamydia rates in persons aged 15-44 years were higher in females than males in all counties in the M-H Region and for the state.

Figure 270 Source: Office of Sexual Health and Epidemiology, 2017-2019 https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/std/index.htm SYPHILIS Syphilis is a curable STI that can lead to very serious complications when left untreated. Syphilis is divided into primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Primary syphilis presents as a sore(s) that may be located on or around the penis, vagina, anus, lips, mouth, or rectum. Any sexually active person can contract syphilis through direct contact with a syphilis sore during unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Since pregnant women infected with syphilis can also transmit the infection to their babies during childbirth, they should be tested for syphilis at least once during their pregnancy.197 For surveillance purposes, early syphilis is defined as the aggregate count of primary and secondary syphilis diagnoses with syphilis diagnosed within the first year of infection that had progressed beyond primary and secondary stages.198 Compared to 2014-2016, in 2017-2019 early syphilis case rates increased for all M-H Region counties between 30% and 70%. The highest early syphilis case rates per 100,000 were seen in Dutchess (23.2) and Orange (19.2) Counties, and the lowest was seen in Rockland County (10.3). The M-H Region combined reported lower early syphilis case rates than NYS for both three-year periods [see Figure 271]. 197 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm, accessed May 2022 198 New York State Department of Health, Office of Sexual Health and Epidemiology, 2019, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/std/docs/sti_surveillance_report_2019.pdf, accessed May 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester 2018 1169 1562 188 1105 273 601 3925 2019 1158 1738 212 1182 280 603 4254 2020 891 1430 138 935 213 471 3017 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 Case Count Total Reported Chlamydia Cases, 2018-2020 Health Indicators 291 Figure 271 Source: NYSDOH Community Health Indicator Reports (CHIRS), 2021 https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&p=it&ind_id= Gg45 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS 2014-2016 11.3 6.1 6.7 7.1 6.2 4.6 9.9 8.4 25.2 2017-2019 23.3 19.2 11.5 10.3 11.5 12.1 14.1 15.2 34.5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Rate per 100,000 Early Syphilis Case Rate per 100,000, 2014-2016 and 2017-2019 Health Indicators 292 Figure 272 shows the trajectory of early syphilis case rates per 100,000 for all counties in the M-H Region compared to NYS for the years 2011 through 2018.

NYC highly impacts the overall rate for NYS, and trends in M-H Region counties track more closely with that seen in NYS excluding NYC, with M-H Region counties showing a faster rate of increase starting in 2016.

From 2019 to 2020, all counties except Westchester and Putnam reported decreases in early syphilis cases. It is important to note that March of 2020 marked the start of a nationwide state of emergency due to COVID-19, significantly impacting the surveillance and reporting of sexually transmitted infections. Syphilis transmission may have also been affected by COVID-19 safety precautions and mandates for NY on Pause, which decreased person-to-person contact.

Congenital syphilis is a disease that occurs when a mother passes the infection to her baby during childbirth. Syphilis in pregnancy can result in adverse birth outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, low birthweight, and death shortly after delivery. Babies born with congenital syphilis can suffer from deformed bones, severe anemia, an enlarged liver or spleen, jaundice, brain and nerve problems, developmental disabilities, vision and hearing loss, meningitis, seizures, and skin rashes. These severe complications can be mitigated by the work of local health departments and obstetrical care providers to assure that cases in pregnant women are identified and appropriately treated. The CDC recommends that all women be tested at their first prenatal check-up, while some women should also be tested more than once during pregnancy.199 From 2016 to 2020 there were between one and four cases of congenital syphilis reported each year in the M-H Region.

It usually occurs when sexually transmitted bacteria spread from the vagina to the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.201 PID often has no signs or symptoms and, as a result, many do not know they have it or when they need treatment. Individuals usually are unaware they have PID until they have trouble getting pregnant or develop chronic pelvic pain. While PID can be treated, treatment cannot undo the damage that has already occurred to the reproductive system. The longer it takes to get treatment, the more likely complications will arise from PID. If untreated, PID complications may result in the formation of scar tissue inside and outside of the fallopian tubes. This can lead to tubal blockage, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and long-term pelvic/abdominal pain. However, once treated, it is possible to be re-infected with PID if one becomes infected with another STI. In addition, if an individual has already had PID, they have a higher risk of contracting it again. Because PID can result in serious complications, it is a reportable disease in NYS. This means medical professionals must report cases of PID to the NYSDOH. While PID often does not have symptoms in the early stages, if symptoms present, they often mirror other more common infections. Data regarding PID is not included as misdiagnosis often leads to inconsistent or incomplete reporting with unstable rates.202 The rates of PID hospitalizations can be found on the NYS Community Health Indicator Reports dashboard located at: https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dash board&p=it&ind_id=Gh14#pagetitle 200 Congenital syphilis data was extracted from the New York State's Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System (CDESS) by individual counties and should be considered preliminary. 201 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/std/pid/stdfact-pid.htm, accessed September 2022 202 NIH, National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2003, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14603097/, accessed September 2022 Health Indicators 295 TICK-BORNE DISEASES LYME DISEASE Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms of Lyme disease may include fever, headache, fatigue, and a rash known as erythema migrans. Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system.203 Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings, and exposure to infected ticks. Laboratory testing can also be helpful in diagnosing Lyme disease. Each year, approximately 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC by state health departments; however, the actual number of infections per year is thought to be much higher. Recent estimates suggest that this number is closer to 476,000.204 Steps to prevent Lyme disease include using insect repellent, removing ticks promptly, using pesticides, and reducing tick habitats. In 2020, Dutchess and Orange Counties had the highest number of cases (198 and 180, respectively), while Ulster County had the lowest number of cases (81). Data for Sullivan County was not available but historically case numbers have been high, with 653 cases in 2019. All seven counties in the M-H Region saw lower Lyme disease case numbers in 2020 than in previous years, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare visits and laboratory testing. Nationally, the rate of ED visits for tick bites per 100,000 population decreased by nearly 40% and Lyme disease testing decreased by an estimated 25%, which could contribute to lower number of reported Lyme disease cases.205 Figure 274 *: Data totals for 2020 are preliminary at the time of this report. s: Preliminary data are not available. Note: The number of cases is determined using sentinel surveillance, which is extrapolated from samples of positive laboratory results to generate estimates of the total number of cases.

Early symptoms of anaplasmosis may include fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. If left untreated, or if other medical conditions are present, anaplasmosis can cause more serious illness resulting in respiratory failure, bleeding problems, organ failure, and, in rare cases, death.206 Anaplasmosis is diagnosed based on symptoms and blood tests. People with weakened immune systems may be at an increased risk of severe outcomes. The number of reported anaplasmosis cases in the US rose from 2000 to 2017, peaking in 2017 with 5,762. It decreased in 2018 and increased again in 2019 to 5,655.207 The geographic range of anaplasmosis also appears to be increasing as black-legged ticks expand in range. From 2018 to 2019 the states with the highest incidence category of Anaplasmosis (13.1+ per million population) increased from 11 to 12 states. As of 2019, the states with the highest rates, in ascending order, are ND, NJ, PA, WI, MN, CT, NY, MA, RI, NH, ME, and VT. Only one state dropped from that category (DE), and all other states within that category had rate increases. NYS\u2019 incidence nearly doubled from 2018 to 2019.208 Westchester County had the highest number of reported cases in the M-H Region in 2020 (41) and Rockland had the lowest (7) [see Figure 276]. In most counties, the case rate decreased from 2017 to 2018, increased in 2019 (except for Rockland, which saw a decrease), and decreased again in 2020 [see Figure 277]. In 2020, Putnam County reported the highest rate of anaplasmosis cases (30.4 per 100,000 population) and Rockland had the lowest (2.2 per 100,000 population) [see Figure 277].

Tick-borne transmission is most common in the Northeast and upper Midwest of the US and usually peaks during warmer months. Many individuals infected with babesiosis do not experience any symptoms, but treatment is available for those who do.

The virus can be spread to people and pets that are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal.213 All mammals are susceptible to rabies, but in the US more than 90% of reported cases of rabies in animals are in wildlife. Species that most commonly carry rabies include raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Rabies is much less common in domestic animals due to ongoing efforts to maintain high vaccination rates in these species.

Contact with infected bats, which can go unrecognized, is the leading cause of these human cases.214 In NYS, local health departments prevent rabies in people by offering vaccinations to pets, investigating reports of human and pet exposures to possibly rabid animals, and assuring access to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP) when indicated. After a possible rabies exposure, appropriate medical care and administration of RPEP is critical to prevent the development of the disease. In 2021, only a single domestic animal from Rockland County tested positive for rabies, constituting 4.2% of domestic animal species tested from Rockland and 0.5% of all domestic animal specimens tested from the M-H Region [see Table 38]. Dutchess County had the highest number of rabies-positive wild animals (5), and Orange County had the highest percentage of wild animals submitted test positive (7.8%). Across the M-H Region, 17 wild animals tested positive, constituting 2.9% of all wild animals submitted for rabies testing [see Table 39].

One common HAI is Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), a bacterium that can cause symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening colon inflammation.215 This is usually the result of side effects from taking antibiotics. While C. diff is often a HAI acquired in health care settings, it can also be acquired in the community. Most cases of C. diff occur in people aged 65 years and older, people who take antibiotics and receive medical care, people staying in hospitals and nursing homes for a long period of time, people with weakened immune systems, and people who have had a previous C. diff infection. Symptoms of C. diff may start within a few days of infection or several weeks after taking antibiotics. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, stomach tenderness, loss of appetite, and nausea. C. diff is easily spread from person to person and it is a major health threat. Many HAIs, such as C. diff, are preventable. Recent studies have suggested that implementing infection prevention practices can lead to up to a 70% reduction in HAIs.216 Healthy People 2020 objectives were developed to measure the progress towards reducing the incidence of certain HAIs, such as C. Diff.

Getting early and regular prenatal care in the first trimester can help keep mothers and their babies healthy as it lets medical providers identify and treat health problems early. Babies born to mothers who do not get prenatal care are three times more likely to have a low birthweight and five times more likely to die.217 During their first two trimesters, mothers should have prenatal visits every four to six weeks. After the first two trimesters, mothers should schedule prenatal visits every two to three weeks until week 36. After week 36, mothers should have a prenatal visit every week. One objective of Healthy People 2020 was to increase the proportion of pregnant women who receive early and adequate prenatal care. Their target goal was to increase the percentage of pregnant women who receive prenatal care beginning in the first trimester to 84.8%.218 The M-H Region fell below this target, with 77.8% of women receiving early prenatal care in the first trimester [see Figure 283]. This percentage was highest in Putnam County (86.8%) and lowest in Sullivan County (67.7%). The rate of women receiving late or no prenatal care was also highest in Orange, Sullivan, and Ulster Counties (5.3%, 5.2%, and 5.2%, respectively), but fell below the 5.4% of women in NYS that received late or no prenatal care. 217 OASH, Office on Women\u2019s Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, 2021, https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/prenatal-care, accessed June 2022 218 Healthy People 2020, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, 2022, https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/maternal-infant-and-child-health, accessed June 2022 Health Indicators 307 Figure 283 Source: NYSDOH Community Health Indicator Reports (CHIRS), 2021 https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&p=it&ind_id=I b21 https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&p=it&ind_id=I b22 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS Early prenatal care 84.4% 72.4% 86.8% 74.5% 67.7% 72.5% 81.5% 77.8% 76.3% Late/no prenatal care 3.7% 5.3% 2.5% 3.8% 5.2% 5.2% 3.9% 4.2% 5.4% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Percent Percent of Births With Early (1st Trimester) Prenatal Care or Late (3rd Trimester)/No Prenatal Care, 2017-2019 Health Indicators 308 From 2011 to 2018, there were no marked changes in the percentage of women who receive early, late, or no prenatal care in the M-H Region [see Figure 284, Figure 285].

Women aged 35 years and older who become pregnant may be more likely to develop health conditions, such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. These health conditions can cause problems during pregnancy, including premature birth, low birthweight, birth defects such as Down syndrome, miscarriage, stillbirth, and needing a cesarean section (C-section). Those aged 35 years and older are recommended to have additional prenatal testing done to assess whether their baby is at risk for certain birth defects. In the M-H Region, 27.8% of births were to women aged 35 years and older. Westchester County had the highest percentage of births to women over the age of 35 (34.0%), while Sullivan County had the lowest percentage (18.2%) [see Figure 290].

Despite this progress, the teen pregnancy rate in the US is substantially higher than any other western industrialized nation. Poorer socioeconomic status conditions, such as lower education and lower income level, may contribute to higher rates of teen pregnancy. Teens in child welfare systems are also more likely to experience teen pregnancy. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to high school dropout rates. In the US, 50% of teen mothers graduate high school by age 22, while 90% of women who did not give birth during adolescence received a high school diploma. The children of teenage mothers are more likely to have lower school achievement and drop out of high school, have more health problems, become incarcerated at some point during adolescence, give birth as a teenager, and experience unemployment as an adult.220 The overall rate for pregnancy in teens aged 15 to 19 years for the M-H Region was lower than NYS (16.5 per 1,000 vs. 23.9 per 1,000, respectively). Sullivan County had the highest pregnancy rate among teens aged 15 to 19 years in the M-H Region (32.9 per 1,000) [see Figure 292]. This rate has been decreasing statewide from 2011 to 2018 [see Figure 293].

Preterm babies, especially those born very early, often have medical complications. While these complications may vary, typically the more premature a baby is, the higher the risk for complications.222 Risk factors for premature birth include pregnancy with twins, triplets, or other multiples; conceiving through in-vitro fertilization; smoking cigarettes or using illicit drugs; certain infections, especially those of the amniotic fluid and lower genital tract; certain chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes; stressful life events; physical injury or trauma; and an interval of less than six months between pregnancies. While the preterm birth rate declined 1% nationwide in 2020, racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. In 2020, the rate of preterm birth among Black women in the US was about 50% higher than the rate of preterm birth among White or Hispanic women.223 Short-term complications of premature birth may include problems with the blood, heart, brain, gastrointestinal system, and immune system. Additionally, there may be further complications with breathing, metabolism, and 222 Mayo Clinic, 2021, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-birth/symptoms-causes/syc-20376730, accessed May 2022 223 Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm, accessed June 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS Medicaid 38.6% 56.8% 25.7% 64.8% 64.8% 45.9% 33.3% 46.7% 50.0% Self-pay 0.7% 0.4% 0.4% 1.2% 0.2% 0.6% 0.3% 0.6% 1.0% Private insurance 57.8% 35.5% 71.1% 29.9% 28.2% 48.4% 60.1% 47.3% 45.4% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Percent Percent of Live Births by Financial Coverge, 2019 Health Indicators 320 temperature control. Long-term complications of premature birth may include vision, hearing, dental, behavioral, and psychological problems. Additionally, complications may include cerebral palsy, impaired learning, and other chronic health issues.224 Healthy People 2020 set an objective to reduce the total number of preterm births to 9.4%. The M-H Region met this target with only 8.3% of births being preterm [see Figure 296]. Rockland County had the lowest rate of preterm births (6.4%), while Dutchess, Sullivan, and Westchester Counties had the highest rates (9.2%, 9.1%, and 9.1%, respectively), but all still fell under the target goal. The percentage of preterm births has generally remained stable over time; Sullivan County saw a slight decrease, while Ulster County saw a slight increase in the percentage of preterm births between 2011 and 2017 [see Figure 297].

Over eight percent of all births in the US are LBW and this percentage is increasing.225 This is thought to be a result of an increased number of babies born prematurely in multiples. The primary cause of LBW is preterm birth. Preterm birth means a baby has less time in a mother\u2019s uterus to grow and gain weight. Another cause of LBW is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). IUGR occurs when a baby does not grow adequately during pregnancy due to problems with the placenta, the mother\u2019s health, or the baby\u2019s condition. Babies with IUGR may be born at full term, but still have LBW. 225 Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/low-birthweight, accessed May 2022 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Percent Percent of Preterm Births (< 37 Weeks Gestation), 2011-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 322 There are different risk factors that can contribute to a baby being born with LBW. Non-Hispanic Black babies are two times more likely to have a LBW than non-Hispanic White babies. Babies born to teen mothers have a higher risk of having LBW as well. Babies born in multiples are at an increased risk because they are often preterm. The health of the mother may also contribute to risk of LBW due to the mother\u2019s exposure to alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs. Babies born to mothers of low socioeconomic status are also at a higher risk of being born with a LBW due to poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, and pregnancy complications.226 Babies with LBW have a higher risk of complications. They may have a harder time eating, gaining weight, controlling their body temperature, and fighting infections. Because many babies with LBW are also premature, it can be difficult to tell which problems are due to the premature birth and which problems are due to LBW.227 Generally, the lower the birthweight, the greater the risk for complications. Healthy People 2020 set a target of no more than 7.8% of births resulting in LBW. NYS and the M-H Region both fell below this mark (6.3% and 7.1%, respectively). All counties in the M-H Region met the Healthy People 2020 goal, with Sullivan County having the highest percentage at 7.8% and still meeting the Healthy People 2020 target [see Figure 298]. Over time, there has not been a significant change in the percentage of LBW births from 2011 to 2018 [see Figure 299].

It is an important indicator of both maternal and infant health, as well as the overall health of a society.228 The five leading causes of infant mortality in the US in 2018 were birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, injuries, sudden infant death syndrome, and maternal pregnancy complications. One of the objectives of Healthy People 2020 was to reduce the rate of all infant deaths to no more than 6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.229 The risk of infant mortality can be reduced by increasing access to quality preconception, prenatal, and interconception care. Infant health is influenced by socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as education, family income, and breastfeeding, but it is also associated with the physical and mental health of an infant\u2019s parents and caregivers. NYS has reached the goal set by Healthy People 2020 with 4.4 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. The M-H Region had a lower rate of 3.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Dutchess County had the highest infant mortality rate (4.3 deaths per 1,000 live births). Putnam County had the lowest infant mortality rate in the M-H Region (2.5 deaths per 1,000 live births) [see Figure 301].

Birth spacing refers to the time from one child\u2019s birth until the next pregnancy. Pregnancies that start less than 18 months after birth are associated with delayed prenatal care and adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, neonatal morbidity, and low birthweight.230 Healthy People 2020 uses 18 months as the ideal spacing between pregnancies.231 Healthy People 2020 set an objective to reduce the number pregnancies conceived within 18 months of a previous birth to 29.8%. The M-H Region and NYS were both just higher than the target with a 33.6% and 30.4% rate, respectively. Rockland County had the highest rate of births conceived within 18 months of a previous pregnancy at 42.4%, closely followed by Sullivan and Orange Counties (40.0% and 37.9%, respectively). Westchester had the lowest percentage (26.5%) while Dutchess (29.6%), Putnam (29.3%), and Ulster (29.3%) all were just under the target rate [see Figure 303]. The rates of pregnancy within 18 months of a previous birth have remained steady across the M-H Region and NYS [see Figure 304].

During this time, well-child visits to the pediatrician are important for tracking a child\u2019s growth and development. These visits typically begin a few days after birth and continue until age 18. In order to find or prevent problems, well-child visits should include a physical exam, which assesses a child\u2019s growth and development. During these visits, guardians should receive information regarding sleep, safety, childhood diseases, and what to expect as the child grows. The medical provider will also pay special attention to how a child is growing compared to typical developmental milestones. This is done by measuring a child\u2019s height, weight, and head circumference.232 232 Medline Plus, https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001928.htm, accessed June 2022 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Percent Percent of Live Births Conceived Within 18 Months of a Previous Live Birth, 2011-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 329 Another benefit of a well-child visit is the opportunity to talk about prevention. For many children, the most common cause of harm is preventable injury or illness. A well-child visit is an opportunity to review critical strategies to protect a child from injury, such as reviewing car seat use and safe firearm storage. The well-child visit is an opportunity to ensure a child is protected from infectious disease by reviewing and updating immunizations. If there is a family history of a particular illness, parents can discuss strategies to prevent that illness for their child. Healthy behaviors are important to instill at a young age and the well-child visit is a time to review these important behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and physical activity.233 Well-child visits are also a good time to discuss family relationship issues, school, illness prevention, health and safety issues, and access to community services. During teenage years, these visits give adolescents an opportunity to take steps towards independence and responsibility over their own health behaviors. Adolescent visits provide an opportunity for teenagers to address important questions, including substance use, sexual behavior, and mental health concerns.234 Other aspects of a well-child visit may include checking blood pressure, vision and hearing tests, blood work, and screening tests for anemia, lead exposure, or tuberculosis. In 2019, 75.2% of children in government sponsored insurance programs had the recommended number of well-child visits in NYS. This was slightly higher than the M-H Region, where 72.6% of children received the recommended number of well-child visits. Putnam had the highest percentage of children who received the recommended number of well-child visits (79.3%), followed closely by Dutchess County at 78.6%. Rockland had the lowest percentage of children receiving the recommended number of well-child visits at 69.3%, followed by Orange (70.4%) and Ulster (70.8%) [see Figure 305]. From 2010 to 2019, there has been no considerable change in the numbers of children receiving the recommended number of well-child visits in the M-H Region or NYS [see Figure 306].

It enhances a person\u2019s ability to speak, smile, chew, taste, and make facial expressions. Oral diseases include mouth issues, such as caries (also known as cavities or tooth decay), gum disease, and oral cancers. Poor oral health has been linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. It has also been linked to lifestyle behaviors, including tobacco use and eating and drinking substances that have high sugar content. In the US, more than 90% of adults have had at least one cavity in their lifetime.235 According to the CDC, the US spends more than $124 billion per year on dental care. 235 Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/basics/adult-oral-health/adult_older.htm, accessed June 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Percent Percent of Children With Recommended Number of Well-Child Visits in Government Sponsored Insurance Programs, 2010-2019 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 331 On average, more than $45 billion in productivity and more than 34 million school hours are lost because of dental emergencies requiring unplanned care. The most common barriers to achieving good oral health include financial barriers, geographic location, lack of dental insurance, poor oral health literacy, and language, education, or cultural barriers.236 To combat poor oral health, people are encouraged to have a dental visit at least once a year for routine examination and cleaning. In 2018, 71.3% of adults in NYS excluding NYC had a dental visit within the past year. This is slightly higher than the NYS percentage of 69.6%. In the M-H Region, Putnam (76.6%) and Rockland (76.2%) had the highest rates while Sullivan had the lowest at 56.4%. Dutchess County (67.9%) was the only other county besides Sullivan to fall below the NYS percentage.

Between 2019 and 2020, the percentage of adults who had a dental visit within the past 12 months decreased in all family income levels, but rates were lowest in households below the Federal Poverty Level with only 45.7% of adults in 2020 reporting a dental visit within the past 12 months.237 This includes people enrolled in Medicaid insurance, where general health care coverage is limited, compared to those with private or other forms of insurance. 236 American Student Dental Association, https://www.asdanet.org/index/get-involved/advocate/issues-and-legislative-priorities/Barriers-to-Care, accessed June 2022 237 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Health and Human Services, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db435.pdf, accessed June 2022 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 2013-2014 2016 2018 Percent Age-Adjusted Percent of Adults Who Had a Dentist Visit Within the Past Year, 2013-2018 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester NYS excl NYC NYS Health Indicators 332 Compared to the overall population of Medicaid enrollees, those aged 2 to 20 years were more likely to visit their dentist within the last year. The M-H Region had a higher percentage of all Medicaid enrollees who have had a dentist visit within the last year compared to NYS (35.1% and 26.3%, respectively). Of the seven counties in the M-H Region, Rockland had the highest percentage of all enrollees (45.6%) and those aged 2 to 20 years old (64.2%) who had a dental visit within the past year. Five out of seven counties exceeded the NYS rate for all enrollees as well as enrollees aged 2 to 20 years having a dental visit within the past year [see Figure 308]. Percentages across the M-H Region remained steady until 2019, where each county saw a slight decrease. The 2019 data, a three-year average including data from 2020, could indicate a decrease in dental visits due to COVID-19 related concerns preventing people from seeking medical and dental treatment238 [see Figure 309].

Dental sealants, a thin plastic covering placed on the chewing surfaces of teeth, can help prevent tooth decay, especially in younger children. Research has shown that dental sealants can prevent up to 80% of tooth decay in the treated teeth.240 Many children and adolescents do not get dental sealants, and there are disparities by race/ethnicity and income. Nationwide, only 37% of children and adolescents aged 3 to 19 years had received dental sealants on one or more of their primary and permanent molars between 2013 to 2016. Healthy People 2030 aims to increase this percentage to 42.5%.241 Providing sealants through school-based programs is an effective way to increase their use.242 Community water fluoridation is the most effective way to deliver the benefits of fluoride to a community. Studies show that it prevents tooth decay by 18% to 40%.243 Information on fluoridation of the water supply in the M-H Region counties can be found in Figure 32. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH Health is an all-encompassing term that not only involves the physical well-being of an individual, but also his or her mental wellness. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a \u201cstate of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d244 There are many factors that contribute to a person\u2019s mental health, including daily habits, traumatic life events, family history of mental illness, and substance use. Almost one in five young people in the US are affected by some type of mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder (MEB), such as depression or substance use.245 Poor mental health can affect all aspects of an individual\u2019s life, including family, school, and work. It is a major economic burden for the US, costing $193.2 billion in lost earnings annually due to serious mental illness.246 Mental health and physical health are closely connected and it is therefore important to address the issues surrounding mental health in the community. When looking at Figure 311, the percentage of adults who reported poor mental health for 14 or more days in 2018 was highest in Dutchess, Ulster, and Sullivan Counties (11.7%, 11.6%, and 11.2%, respectively), while the lowest percentage was in Orange County (8.6%). The M-H Region as a whole is less than NYS (9.1% vs 11.2%, respectively). From 2016 to 2018, the percentage has decreased in most counties with the exception of Putnam and Rockland. 240 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/fast-facts/dental-sealants/index.html, accessed June 2022 241 Healthy People 2030, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/oral-conditions/increase-proportion-children-and-adolescents-who-have-dental-sealants-1-or-more-molars-oh-10, accessed June 2022 242 Healthy People 2020, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/oral-health/objectives, accessed June 2022 243 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html, accessed September 2022 244 World Health Organization, https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution, accessed June 2022 245 New York State Department of Health, 2020, https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2019-2024/wb.htm, accessed June 2022 246 National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2022, https://www.nami.org/mhstats, accessed June 2022 Health Indicators 336 Figure 311 Source: NYSDOH Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2018 https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-H/jsy7-eb4n/data Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS excl NYC NYS 2016 13.7% 11.8% 8.5% 8.0% 14.9% 12.3% 9.1% 10.6% 11.2% 10.7% 2018 11.7% 8.6% 10.0% 9.2% 11.2% 11.6% 8.9% 9.1% 11.8% 11.2% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% Percent Age-Adjusted Percent of Adults with Poor Mental Health for 14 or More Days in the Last Month, 2016-2018 Health Indicators 337 One of the major disorders that can lead to poor mental health is depression. This is a mood disorder that causes a constant feeling of sadness or lack of interest in performing any life activities. When looking at the percentage of people reporting a depressive disorder in 2018, the highest percentage was seen in Sullivan County (23.5%) and the lowest in Putnam County (10.4%) [see Figure 312]. Note that substantially more people are reporting a depressive disorder in 2018 compared to 2016 for all counties, the M-H Region, and NYS.

Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, can affect a person\u2019s brain and behavior and interfere with meeting responsibilities at school, work, or at home. It increases the risk of social, physical, and mental health problems. These include teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, STIs, domestic violence, crime, homicide, and suicide.247 According to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 40.3 million people aged 12 years or older (or 14.5% of this population) had a substance use disorder in the past year, including 28.3 million who had alcohol use disorder and 18.4 million who had an illicit drug use disorder.248 247 Healthy People 2020, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Department of Health and Human Services, https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/substance-abuse, accessed June 2022 248 US Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2021, https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt35325/NSDUHFFRPDFWHTMLFiles2020/2020NSDUHFFR1PDFW102121.pdf, accessed September 2022 Dutchess Orange Putnam Rockland Sullivan Ulster Westchester Mid-Hudson NYS excl NYC NYS 2016 12.9% 9.4% 8.0% 8.3% 19.0% 14.5% 10.7% 10.8% 13.0% 11.8% 2018 16.8% 11.6% 10.4% 12.5% 23.5% 21.4% 13.2% 13.6% 16.6% 15.3% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% Percent Percent of Adults Reporting a Depressive Disorder, 2016-2018 Health Indicators 338 TOBACCO & VAPING Tobacco use leads to diseases that cause harm to almost every organ in the body. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US and smoking-related illness costs more than $300 billion each year in direct medical care and lost productivity.249 Tobacco contains nicotine, which is a chemical substance that can lead to addiction. More than 16 million Americans are living with a disease that is caused by smoking, some of which include cancer (specifically lung cancer), heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and COPD.250 Table 40 shows the increased risk that smoking can have on the incidence and mortality of certain diseases.

For example, the Medicaid population has a higher prevalence of smoking and has a harder time quitting. African Americans are more likely to die from smoking-related disease. People with mental health conditions are four times more likely to die from smoking. Finally, people experiencing disability have a higher prevalence of smoking.

In 2018, Sullivan County had the highest percentage of adults smoking cigarettes and Westchester County had the lowest percentage (21.0% and 7.0%, respectively). The Healthy People 2020 goal was to reduce cigarette smoking among adults to 12.0%. Most counties have met this target, with the exception of Sullivan and Ulster Counties. The latest Healthy People 2030 goal is 6.1%.251 Figure 314 Source: NYSDOH Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2018 https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-H/jsy7-eb4n/data In 2018, the rates of cigarette smoking were higher among adults who reported poor mental health than those who reported cigarette smoking in general. In Ulster County, there was a higher percentage of cigarette smoking among adults who report poor mental health compared to the population reporting cigarette smoking in general (34.6% vs 13.4%, respectively) [see Figure 314, Figure 315].

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, vaping pens, hookah pens, etc.) were originally created to provide alternative products for those who were looking to quit smoking cigarettes. It has become a new trend among young adults. According to the NYSDOH, the use of e-cigarettes among high school youth increased from 10.5% to 27.4% from 2014 to 2018, which is almost a 160% increase over the past four years.252 However, the trend in any tobacco product use among high school students, including ENDS, has decreased since 2018 from 30.6% to 25.6% in 2020 and has reached the lowest youth smoking rate on record.253 For more information, please visit CDC\u2019s Electronic Cigarette page (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/index.htm).

However, binge drinkers with lower incomes and educational levels have more occasions of binge drinking per year.256 Binge drinking has increased in about half of the counties in the M-H Region from 2016 to 2018 (Dutchess, Orange, Rockland, and Sullivan) and decreased in Putnam, Ulster, and Westchester, as well as NYS and NYS excluding NYC. Sullivan County had the highest percentage of adults binge drinking in 2018 at 22.1% and Rockland County had the lowest percentage at 12.6%.

This was the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period. While overdose deaths were already increasing in the months preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, the latest numbers suggest an acceleration of overdose deaths during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers observed the exacerbation of substance use and drug overdoses in the US.262 Mental distress has also increased across many populations, \u201cincluding individuals with no history of mental illness, younger adults, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers.\u201d263 Stress, trauma, mental distress, and mental illness are recognized to make people more vulnerable to using and abusing substances.263 One notable example occurred in Ulster County, where opioid related overdoses increased by 42.9% from 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 2021 (the height of the COVID-19 pandemic). During the same time, opioid related fatalities increased by 115.2% (Source: Ulster County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office). 262 National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, 2022, https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/comorbidity/covid-19-substance-use, accessed October 2022 263 National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, 2022, https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/comorbidity/covid-19-substance-use, accessed October 2022 Health Indicators 355 SUICIDE Suicide is a serious public health problem that can have lasting harmful effects on individuals, families, and communities. It is associated with several risk factors, including those who have experienced bullying, sexual violence, and child abuse. In 2020, 12.2 million American adults considered attempting suicide and nearly 46,000 died by suicide.264 Protective factors, such as connectedness with family and friends, as well as access to health care services, can help prevent suicide. Healthy People 2030 set the goal to reduce suicide rates to 12.8 suicides per 100,000 population. Most counties met this target, with the exception of Ulster County (13.2 per 100,000 population) [see Figure 329]. Suicide among young adults is also a public health concern, especially in Sullivan and Ulster Counties, where suicide mortality rates among teenagers aged 15-19 years was 14.8 and 15.4 per 100,000 population, respectively, though these rates are unstable.

However, it is especially important for children and adolescents to help them avoid preventable diseases and maintain good health throughout the course of their lives. According to the US Census Bureau, 5.8% of the population in the M-H Region is under five years old; Rockland County has the highest percentage of children in this cohort (8.1%) and Ulster County has the lowest (4.4%) [see Table 22]. Children are at risk for developing certain diseases, some of which include ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) conditions. These are conditions where the use of the ED is thought to be avoidable by focusing on interventions in primary care.265 Some ACS conditions include asthma, otitis media, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. ASTHMA Asthma is caused by airway restriction in the lungs, resulting in difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. It is a condition commonly found among children, but it can be managed and treated with medical care [see page 185]. OTITIS MEDIA Otitis media is an infection that occurs in the middle ear and is most diagnosed in children. Even though antibiotics are typically used to clear the infection, some children are prone to having chronic ear infections. This can lead to other consequences, such as antibiotic resistance, surgery, and hearing loss. Common symptoms of otitis media include ear pain, tugging or pulling at the ear, crying more than usual, trouble hearing, fever, and drainage from the ear.266 From 2011 to 2018, the hospitalization rates for otitis media for children aged 0 to 4 years for most of the M-H Region counties were unstable or did not meet reporting criteria. However, when comparing the M-H Region to NYS and NYS excluding NYC, hospitalization rates steadily decreased [see Figure 331]. 265 The Journal of Pediatrics, NIH, National Library of Medicine, 2018, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826824/, accessed August 2022 266 Mayo Clinic, 2021, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616, accessed August 2022 Child Health 358 Figure 331 Mid-Hudson NYS excl NYC NYS 2011 2.4 2.5 2.9 2012 2.0 1.7 2.4 2013 1.5 1.7 2.2 2014 1.0 1.0 1.7 2015 2016 2.1 2.0 2.2 2017 1.6 1.9 2.1 2018 1.2 1.5 1.8 Note: The rate for 2015 is excluded due to SPARCS data transitioning on October 1, 2015, from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes.

It is typically a viral infection that causes fever, watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.267 Viral infections are generally spread through contact with someone infected with the disease or by ingesting substances contaminated with the infection. Children are especially at risk at day care centers or at schools, as they can encounter other infected classmates. From 2011 to 2018, the hospitalization rates of gastroenteritis for children 0 to 4 years of age for most of the M-H Region counties are unstable or did not meet reporting criteria.

Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It can lead to serious consequences in young children, as well as people over the age of 65. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Hospitalization, tobacco use, or having a weakened immune system can put people at a greater risk of developing pneumonia.268 When looking at pneumonia hospitalization rates from 2017 to 2019 among children 0 to 4 years of age, the M-H Region had a higher rate compared to NYS and NYS excluding NYC (28.3 vs 25.2 and 20.3 per 10,000 population, respectively). Sullivan and Orange Counties led in hospitalization rates within the M-H Region (38.0 and 38.5 per 10,000 population, respectively), and Putnam had the lowest rate (12.0 per 10,000 population) in the region. Rates have generally decreased since 2011 for all seven counties, as well as NYS excluding NYC and NYS [see Figure 333]. It is important that children be vaccinated to prevent pneumococcal infection.

For New Yorkers aged 1 to 44, it was the number one cause of death.269 Beyond death, consequences from injuries include financial burden, disability, poor mental health, and lost productivity.270 Injuries may be intentional (i.e., assault, suicide) or unintentional (i.e., falls, motor vehicle accidents). Well-established patterns and risk factors make injuries predictable and preventable. 271 In the M-H Region in 2018, Sullivan County had the highest unintentional injury mortality rate (75.4 per 100,000 population), while Westchester County had the lowest (26.6 per 100,000 population).

The Upstate New York Poison Control Center covers 54 counties in NYS excluding NYC, and the NYC Poison Center services NYC, Long Island, and Westchester County. To get in touch with the poison control center in your area, dial 1-800-222-1222.275 In 2021, these centers handled a total of 130,670 calls statewide and 12,115 calls from M-H Region counties. Reflective of national data, a high rate of calls pertained to children aged 5 years and under, a population not responsible for managing their own environment. Poison Centers play a critical role in preventing unnecessary health care costs by delineating exposures that can be managed at home. Rockland County had the highest proportion of calls about poison exposures for children aged 5 and under (36%) and Putnam County had the lowest (27%). Across the region, more than 80% of these calls were managed at home. Figure 335 *: Data for Westchester provided by NYC Poison Center.

Domestic violence has wide-ranging consequences including death, injury, and mental health problems, as well as greater risk for a variety of other negative physical health outcomes.289 The NYS Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence runs a Domestic and Sexual Violence Hotline (1-800-942-6906), which serves as a resource for victims of domestic violence, professionals, and those concerned for others. This is a confidential hotline that is available in multiple languages, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. In 2020, aside from NYC and Long Island, which accounted for 59% of the volume of calls, the counties with the highest volume of calls to the hotline were the following: Erie County (6%), Albany County (4%), Westchester County (4%), Orange County (4%), and Schenectady County (2%).290 Domestic violence counts from the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services include victims of aggravated assault, simple assault, sex offense, and violations of an order of protection perpetrated by intimate partners. Among the seven M-H Region counties, Orange had the highest rate (447.8 per 100,000 population) and Putnam had the lowest rate (108.4 per 100,000 population) in 2020.

Dutchess County is 825 square miles, made up of 30 municipalities, consisting of 20 towns, 8 villages, and two cities, Poughkeepsie (the county seat) and the city of Beacon. The southwestern region of Dutchess County is the most densely populated part of the county and includes the cities of Beacon and Poughkeepsie. The rest of the county is predominantly suburban and rural. Dutchess County has a population of almost 300,000 with a majority of residents aged 35-64 years old. In Dutchess County 11.7% of adults report having poor physical or mental health (BRFSS, 2018). AREAS OF FOCUS In Dutchess County, there is a strong need to focus on factors of chronic disease and mental and behavioral health. At least 40% of Dutchess County adults are estimated to have a chronic health condition including but not limited to diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, asthma, arthritis, or obesity. Those with a mental health condition, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, other mood disorder or substance or alcohol use disorder, are also more likely to have a chronic health condition than those without. Due to the interrelatedness of both physical and mental well-being, it is important to focus not only on physical health but mental health as well. Within both sectors, there are several disparities that exist between the more urban-suburban western side of the county and the rural eastern side, between White non-Hispanic residents and Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic residents, and between those who have disabilities\u2019 health and those who do not. These disparities can be seen in the rates of preventable hospitalizations, premature death, opioid overdose, participation in primary care, and provision of mental health services. In order to combat these issues, it is important that the residents of Dutchess County have the access to and support from sufficient, competent health providers to manage their health. Areas of focus should include, though not be limited to: \u2022 Preventable hospitalizations for chronic conditions \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) \u2022 Respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) \u2022 Obesity \u2022 Poor mental health \u2022 Opioid overdose \u2022 Behavioral health including diet/exercise, smoking, alcohol and drug use County Health Summaries 381 EMERGING ISSUES While not affecting as large of a population as the issues mentioned above, sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to steadily increase in Dutchess County. Although numbers are smaller compared to more longstanding chronic diseases, Dutchess County, along with other counties in the Mid-Hudson Region (M-H Region), is seeing a significant increase in the rate of primary syphilis diagnoses. The rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea infection have also risen in recent years. Similarly, as aforementioned, these increases can be tied to behavioral health practices. When reviewing communicable diseases, it is important to address the preventive immunity that vaccines can provide. With more frequent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease in the M-H Region, it is critical to emphasize the maintenance of immunity through the recommended vaccine schedule for both children and adults. Like much of NYS and its neighboring counties, Dutchess County has endured a significant number of COVID-19 cases and associated fatalities. As of July 31, 2022, Dutchess County had a cumulative total of 73,637 individual positive results and 678 fatalities with a weekly incidence rate of 196 per 100,000. At its peak in January 2022, Dutchess County received over 6,000 new case reports within 1 week at a rate of 2,086 cases per 100,000. In Spring 2022, 36% of respondents to the Mid-Hudson Region Health Survey stated that they had ever had COVID-19. Dutchess County residents also acknowledged the toll that COVID-19 had on their health, with 29% saying their physical health worsened and 34% saying their mental health worsened over the course of the pandemic. While not explicitly included in the 2019-2024 New York State Prevention Agenda (NYSPA), the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for competent public health emergency preparedness and response. Additionally, as seen in the United States (US) and NYS, the rate of suicide deaths and intentional self-harm has been increasing steadily within Dutchess County. This reflects the poor mental health of Dutchess County residents and the need for stronger mental and behavioral health resources such as providers and services, as well as a need for increased social capital. Emerging issues include: \u2022 STIs including syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea \u2022 Immunizations \u2022 COVID-19 and other emerging, infectious diseases \u2022 Suicide and self-harm COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE The self-reported physical health status of Dutchess County citizens mirrors that of the M-H Region, with 73% and 76% reporting excellent or good physical health, respectively. In Dutchess County, unemployed individuals, households with disabled persons, and low-income individuals reported poorer overall physical health compared to their peers. The self-reported mental health status of Dutchess County citizens is also similar to the M-H Region overall, with 69% and 73% reporting excellent or good mental health, respectively. Young adults (35 years old and younger), non-White individuals, households with disabled persons, and low-income individuals reported poorer mental health than their peers. Those under the age of 55 reported feeling more stressed than those aged 55 years and older. County Health Summaries 382 Individuals in households with incomes greater than $100,000 per year reported higher alcohol use in 2021-2022. 18% of Dutchess respondents stated that their alcohol consumption increased compared to habits prior to the pandemic, while 17% stated that their non-medical use of drugs increased. Respondents with a person with a disability in the household were noted to have had a more difficult time obtaining basic necessities when they were really needed, including food, utilities, healthcare, medicine, phone or internet service, childcare, transportation, or housing. 22% of Dutchess County respondents said that they have not been to a primary care provider for a routine physical in the last 12 months. The most common reasons for people not visiting a primary care provider for a physical were not having time to go or choosing not to go. Inability to get an appointment and concerns over COVID-19 were also reasons for 20% of those respondents. The proportion of Dutchess County residents reporting visiting an emergency room for a non-emergency issue is similar to that of the M-H Region overall. The most common reason for visiting an emergency room instead of regular doctor\u2019s office was thinking that the non-emergency condition was an actual emergency and that the emergency room\u2019s hours of operation were more convenient than a traditional doctor\u2019s office. Those on the eastern side of the county reported that they were less likely to get where they needed to using public transportation. ASSETS AND RESOURCES Through the Hudson Valley Public Health Collaborative (HVPHC) between the local health departments (LHDs) of the M-H Region, a Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey for the 2022-2024 cycle was conducted to assess various topics related to health and priorities put forward by NYS including healthy aging, health across all policies, and items from the NYSPA. In addition to the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, discussion groups with providers that serve underrepresented populations were held. These groups consisted of agencies that provide services such as mental health support, vocational programs, or household resources to individuals belonging to LGBTQIA+, low-income, veteran, senior, homeless, or other niche populations. The purpose of the discussions was to collect information on the issues specific to individuals who may be dealing with more complex health issues than the general population. A summary of the results of the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey and the provider focus groups was disseminated at an annual Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) Summit. The Summit partners in the current CHIP as well as members of committees associated with the Department of Behavioral and Community Health include, but are not limited to, representatives from national associations, local county departments, hospital and healthcare systems, local universities, non-governmental organizations, non-profit advocacy groups, and the general public. The Summit also included break-out sessions consisting of different topic areas aligned with the NYSPA, where participants discussed the results of the survey and focus groups and brainstormed initiatives that they would like to take in the next CHIP cycle (2022-2024). Through collaboration with CHIP partners, workgroups operate to close the gap on health disparities in the county and M-H Region. Current initiatives include work addressing obesity, tobacco use, suicide, and drug use. Working with various county departments and non-county partners allows for a broad, \u201chealth in all policies\u201d approach to the issues addressed in the Community Health Assessment (CHA) and CHIP. County Health Summaries 383 EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD To address and improve community health, the Dutchess County Department of Behavioral and Community Health (DBCH) will submit a CHIP at the end of 2022. Based on the NYSPA, the CHIP will outline the priority and focus areas for the 2022-2024 cycle and include interventions and appropriate process and outcome metrics. To develop the CHIP, an internal review committee of various DBCH staff from a variety of disciplines will review the CHA and determine the priority areas. With the selection of the priority areas, workgroups with community partners related to those areas will be convened or created (if a novel priority area is selected). The workgroups are then charged with selecting the focuses within the priority areas. Upon selection of the focus areas, interventions with baseline measures, process measures, and outcome measures will be developed. ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY Orange County is in the southeastern area of NYS, bounded on the east by the Hudson River and on the west by the Delaware River. It is located approximately 40 miles north of NYC with 43 municipalities and approximately 382,100 residents. Of Orange County residents, 50.1% are male, 63.1% are non-Hispanic White, 10.1% are non-Hispanic Black, and 21.1% are Hispanic. Orange County is a mix of urban, suburban, farmland, and rural areas. Agriculture is a leading industry in Orange County and constitutes more than half of the county\u2019s open space. The availability of multiple modes of transportation, including bus, train, and major highways, allows residents to travel to NYC, New Jersey, and Southern NYS for employment. Orange County also contains New York Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, NY, West Point Military Academy in Highland Falls, NY, and major tourist attractions such as LEGOLAND New York and the Woodbury Commons Premium Outlets. At first glance, Orange County appears to be an affluent suburban community that enjoys a median household income above the NYS average ($80,816 vs. $71,117, respectively), a smaller percentage of individuals living below the poverty line (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively), a lower unemployment rate (3.0% vs. 3.6%, respectively), and boasts a higher percentage of high school graduates as compared to NYS (89.9% and 87.3%, respectively). However, aggregate county data are misleading and mask the disparities within the county. The urban areas of Orange County are characterized by severe socioeconomic and health inequities, with 13.7% of residents in the three major cities living below the federal poverty line (Newburgh (13.5%), Middletown (13%), and Port Jervis (17.1%)). AREAS OF FOCUS Heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death and premature death (death before age 75) by a large margin. Premature death for those less than 65 years and less than 75 years in Orange County are worse than the NYS rates based on the latest data available.291 These margins are larger for those among racial and ethnic lines, as well as in areas that are socioeconomically disadvantaged.292 Obesity is a leading contributor to these top causes of death, as well as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension, all of which can lead to premature death. Orange County\u2019s age-adjusted all cancer mortality is higher than both NYS and the M-H Region based on the latest available data [see Figure 221]. Over the past ten years, the rates of obesity have continually grown, as well as the subsequent morbidity of CVD, prediabetes, and hypertension. 291 Orange County Department of Health 2022 Community Health Assessment, https://www.orangecountygov.com/180/Community-Health-Assessments, accessed October 2022 292 America's Health Rankings, United Health Foundation, https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/annual/measure/YPLL_Disparity/state/ALL, accessed October 2022 County Health Summaries 384 The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many of the underlying factors that have a profound impact on health such as poverty, food insecurity, education, housing, and access to care, including health insurance. Although strides were made prior to the pandemic in addressing substance use in Orange County, these external stressors contribute to poor mental health and substance use has risen in the past two years. Overdose deaths in the county have increased steadily over time and age-adjusted rates are still higher in Orange County compared to NYS excluding NYC. Other health areas where Orange County is worse than NYS or worsening since the last assessment include: \u2022 Premature deaths (before age 65 years), particularly inequities among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic residents \u2022 STIs including early syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia \u2022 Infant mortality among non-Hispanic Black women and Hispanic women \u2022 Premature births among non-Hispanic Black women \u2022 Adults receiving colorectal cancer screening \u2022 Cancer mortality including all cancer, female breast cancer, and colorectal cancer \u2022 Childhood immunization rates among children 24-35 months of age \u2022 Unemployment rate \u2022 Overdose deaths involving any opioid \u2022 Gross rent as a percentage of household income: occupied units paying rent 30% or more EMERGING ISSUES \u2022 Food insecurity \u2022 Residents struggling with mental health issues since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2022 Affordable housing \u2022 Emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and Monkeypox \u2022 Outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE As part of the CHA process, the Orange County Department of Health (OCDOH) participated in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, in partnership with the six other M-H Region LHDs and the Siena College Research Institute to collect data on 996 residents to help better characterize the needs of the community. Below are data points of note: \u2022 43% of respondents with <$25K yearly income reported that their ability to afford housing worsened over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 23% of Orange County respondents. \u2022 37% of renters in Orange County reported that their ability to obtain affordable, nutritious food worsened over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to only 20% of homeowners. \u2022 33% of respondents with <$25K yearly income reported being unable to access the internet in the past 12 months, compared to 17% of Orange County respondents. \u2022 32% of respondents with <$25K yearly income were unable to get transportation when needed in the previous 12 months, compared to only 17% of Orange County respondents. \u2022 31% of Orange County respondents aged 18-34 years reported that their mental health has worsened over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to only 12% of those aged 55 and older. County Health Summaries 385 \u2022 41% of Orange County respondents in 2022 reported there are sufficient, quality mental health providers, which is a decrease from 55% reported in 2018. \u2022 Only 59% of Orange County respondents aged 18-34 years reported having good or excellent mental health, compared to 75% of Orange County respondents and 85% of respondents aged 55 and older. \u2022 33% of Orange County respondents with <$25K yearly income reported that in the past 12 months, they or any other member of their household has been unable to get any healthcare including dental or vision compared to 21% of total Orange County respondents, and 9% of respondents $150k+ yearly income. \u2022 26% of Orange County respondents aged 18-34 years reported that in the past 12 months, they did not visit primary care physician because they did not have insurance compared to 11% of respondents aged 55 and older. ASSETS AND RESOURCES OCDOH has strong community partnerships with hundreds of organizations serving its residents, including five area hospitals, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), private medical providers, local two-year and four-year colleges, a medical school, community-based organizations (CBOs), and governmental departments serving a broad variety of community needs. OCDOH has established multiple coalitions including Healthy Orange, the Perinatal and Infant Community Health Collaborative (PICHC), and the Orange County Cancer Screening Collaborative. OCDOH also co-leads and participates in many countywide coalitions, such as Changing the Orange County Addiction Treatment Ecosystem, Healing Communities Study Steering Committee and Workgroups, WELCOME Orange, and the Orange County Resilience Project. These coalition partners will be mobilized to address the health areas of focus and emerging issues for the 2022-2024 CHIP cycle. EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD In addition to participating in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, a service provider survey and subsequent focus groups were conducted in May and June 2022, in partnership with the Joint Membership of Health and Community Agencies (JMHCA) and Changing the Addition Treatment Ecosystem, to collect data on underrepresented populations, including low-income, veterans, persons experiencing homelessness, the aging population, LGBTQIA+ community, and people with a mental health diagnosis or with a substance use disorder. Forty-one responses were collected and three underlying issues that impact the health of the populations served by their agencies were identified as follows: access to affordable, decent, and safe house; access to mental health providers; and access to affordable, reliable public and personal transportation. The Community Asset Survey (CAS) was developed to ask residents about the greatest strengths of the community, where should community efforts be focused to improve quality of life, and to identify the most important health issues. Over 900 residents participated in the convenience sample survey and the three areas identified to focus resources and attention to improve quality of life were as follows: more affordable housing, better jobs and economy, and improving public transportation. The top three important health issues identified by the respondents were as follows: drug use; mental health including depression and anxiety; and aging problems (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, arthritis, hearing/vision loss, etc.) Residents were also asked during community events about which health priorities the community should select for the 2022-2024 CHIP cycle. Over 1,500 residents participated and the top two priority areas that residents voted were: County Health Summaries 386 1. Promoting Well-Being and Preventing Mental Health and Substance Use (36.4%) and 2. Promoting Healthy Women, Infants, and Children (26%). As a complement to this secondary data review and the primary data collection with the resident surveys, OCDOH updated the Community Health Assessment Data Review Guide.293 The guide is a review of over 150 of the most current secondary data indicators available, stratified by the New York State Prevention Agenda areas for Orange County and NYS. The data guide will be updated annually and shared with partners. Where available, trends from the previous year and comparison data from NYS were included. This document was provided at the Orange County Health Summit held on June 28th with approximately 100 partners including hospitals, health care providers, CBOs, and academia to review the most current CHA data, identify and discuss the forces that impact the health of residents, provide input on which two Prevention Agenda (PA) Priorities for the 2022-2024 CHIP should be chosen, and participate in breakout groups to discuss current efforts, assets, and barriers in each of the five priority areas. After considering all the data, the two priority areas chosen for 2022-2024 are: 1. Preventing Chronic Disease 2. Promoting Well-Being and Preventing Mental Health and Substance Use Hospital partners and summit participants in each priority area will be involved in the ongoing strategic planning and implementation efforts. Each focus area chosen will have a corresponding workgroup co-led by OCDOH and area hospital staff or community organization partner. These workgroups will report at quarterly meetings as well as the larger yearly Orange County Health Summit to share the ongoing efforts of the CHIP to other workgroups and the community. PUTNAM COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY Putnam County is located approximately 58 miles north of NYC and is bordered by the Hudson River to the west, Connecticut to the east, Dutchess County to the north, and Westchester County to the south. The county\u2019s 230 square miles consist of a mix of rural and suburban communities interspersed with reservoirs, parks, and farmland, divided up into six towns and three villages. More than a third of the population resides in the town of Carmel, which occupies the central southern portion of the county.294 The US Census Bureau estimates the county\u2019s population at 97,936, among which 19.2% are children under 18 years of age and 18.6% are adults 65 years and over.295 Putnam\u2019s population is aging, indicated by the increases in the percent of the population aged 65 years and over alongside a gradually decreasing birthrate in the last 10 years.296 Approximately 90% of the population is White, 4.5% is Black, 3.0% is Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander, and 2.2% is of two or more races. Hispanics make up 17.7% of the population. Nearly 20% of the population aged five years or older speaks a language other than English at home and nearly 14% is foreign born.295 293 Orange County Department of Health 2022 Community Health Assessment, https://www.orangecountygov.com/180/Community-Health-Assessments, accessed October 2022 294 United States Census Bureau QuickFacts, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sis/resources/data-tools/quickfacts.html, accessed July 2022 295 U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sis/resources/data-tools/quickfacts.html, accessed July 2022 296 New York State Department of Health, NYSCHIRS, https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=%2FEBI%2FPHIG%2Fapps%2Fchir_dashboard%2Fchir_dashboard&p=ch&cos=3 7&ctop=14, accessed July 2022 County Health Summaries 387 Putnam is a well-educated and affluent county. Over 90% of the population has a high school or higher degree, and nearly 41% has a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.295 The median annual household income has trended up in the last decade and in 2019 was the third highest in the state. The county\u2019s poverty rate has been flat over the past decade and, at 5.2% in 2019, was the lowest of all counties in the state. However, like the state as a whole, Putnam County did see a significant upward trend in the unemployment rate from 2019 to 2020 which could impact income and poverty levels moving forward.297 For the past 10 years Putnam County has consistently ranked amongst the top five healthiest counties in the state in the University of Wisconsin\u2019s annual County Health Rankings & Roadmaps report, and in the 2022 edition Putnam ranked first in the state for the index measure of health outcomes and third for the health factors index.298 While these rankings represent a significant accomplishment, they do not diminish the importance of identifying gaps and areas for improvement through the M-H Regional CHA process as detailed in the following sections. AREAS OF FOCUS Putnam County Department of Health (PCDOH) conducted a systematic review of Putnam data for all the indicators included in the M-H Regional CHA and any additional indicators included on the NYSPA Dashboard, the Health Status and Social Determinants of Health section of the NYS Community Health Indicator Reports (CHIRS) Dashboard, and/or the NYS County Health Indicators by Race/Ethnicity (CHIRE) Dashboard. Indicators were flagged if they met any of the following criteria: PA objective not met; performance worse than the M-H Region, NYS, or five or more counties in the M-H Region; indicator performance worsening over time; or disparities on the CHIRE. Flagged indicators were then examined for patterns, and determinants of health or health issues with two or more flags were given consideration as an area of focus. On this basis, major areas of focus identified include transportation (determinant of health), disparities in birth-related indicators, obesity, early childhood immunization, and tickborne disease. Data points in this summary are footnoted if they are not found in the M-H Regional CHA. Transportation is a fundamental social determinant of health because it influences the ability to access employment and meet other basic needs such as accessing healthy food. Putnam is heavily dependent on cars, which carry a high-cost burden and contribute to pollution. Compared to other counties in the region, Putnam County has the highest mean travel time to work. When examining five-year rates posted on CHIRS, both the mean travel time to work and the percentage of workers commuting alone are increasing, while the percentage of workers using public transportation is decreasing.297 On the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, only 36% of Putnam respondents agreed that people can get where they need to go using public transportation, a decrease from 40% in 2018, and lower than the regional percentage of 56%. The health and well-being of pregnant people and infants directly impacts the health of the next generation. Although Putnam County generally performs well in birth-related indicators as compared to other counties in the M-H Region, like NYS,299 disparities can be seen when these indicators are examined by race and ethnicity from 297 New York State Department of Health, NYSCHIRS, 2022, https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=%2FEBI%2FPHIG%2Fapps%2Fchir_dashboard%2Fchir_dashboard&p=ch&cos=3 7&ctop=14, accessed July 2022 298 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, County Health Rankings & Roadmap, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new-york/2022/downloads, accessed July 2022 299 New York State Department of Health, NYSCHIRE, 2022, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/community/minority/county/newyorkstate.htm, accessed August 2022 County Health Summaries 388 2017-2019. When examining the percentage of births with first trimester prenatal care and adequate prenatal care, the percentages were lower in Asian/Pacific Islander (78.6%, 83.8%), Hispanic (80.5%, 84.9%), and non-Hispanic Black (84.5%, 84.6%) births than White births (90.1%, 89.8%). There was a higher percentage of premature births in non-Hispanic Black (16.9%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (10.0%) births than White (8.2%) and Hispanic births (7.6%). The percentage of low birthweight births was much higher in non-Hispanic Black (15.5%) births than Hispanic (6.7%), White (6.0%) and Asian/Pacific Islander births (5.7%).300 Obesity puts individuals at greater risk of developing a whole host of chronic diseases,301 including heart disease which was the leading cause of death in Putnam County in all years from 2010-2019 except for 2016. In 2018 Putnam had the second highest percentage of adults overweight or obese in the region and the percent that is obese increased from 21% in 2016 to 27% in 2018. Putnam also had the second highest percent of adults consuming one or more sugary beverages daily in the region in 2018 (25.6%), up from 22.9% in 2016. When looking at school-age children, the percent overweight or obese is also increasing, as is the percent obese when stratified by elementary and middle/high school age students. High childhood vaccination rates are critical to maintaining community level protection against diseases that were commonplace before the advent of vaccines, as highlighted by a recent case of poliomyelitis in the M-H Region.302 In 2020, 61.9% of Putnam children 24-35 months of age had completed the routine childhood vaccinations (4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series) recommended by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). While this rate is higher than the region, it is lower than the state, lower still than the PA 2024 goal of 70.5%, and represents a dramatic decrease from 70.8% in 2019. There is evidence that the diseases prevented by these vaccines are increasing in incidence in Putnam County. Incidence of pertussis is higher than that for the state and increased from 2018 to 2019. Mumps incidence also increased from 2018 to 2019. Incidence of Haemophilus influenza is higher than that both for the region and the state and three-year average rates have been trending up over the past decade.303 Putnam County bears a disproportionally high burden of tickborne disease. NYS is amongst 14 states and the District of Columbia considered to be high incidence for Lyme disease,304 and Putnam consistently is one of the counties with the highest incidence in the state.305 While Lyme disease is most common, the second and third most common tickborne diseases, anaplasmosis and babesiosis, have a similar geographic distribution because they are all transmitted by the same tick, Ixodes scapularis.306 Putnam had the highest incidence of Lyme in the region from 2011-2020, the third highest rate of anaplasmosis from 2014-2019 and the highest rate in 2020, and the first or second highest rate of babesiosis every year since 2010. When we include preliminary data from recent years (only available for anaplasmosis and babesiosis) we see that reported cases of babesiosis in Putnam 300 New York State Department of Health, NYSCHIRE, 2022, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/community/minority/county/putnam.htm, accessed August 2022 301 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html, accessed August 2022 302 New York State of Opportunity, Department of Health, 2022, https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/docs/2022-07-29_han.pdf, accessed August 2022 303 New York State Department of Health, CHIRS, 2022, https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=%2FEBI%2FPHIG%2Fapps%2Fchir_dashboard%2Fchir_dashboard&p=ch&cos=3 7&ctop=5, accessed August 2022 304 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html, accessed August 2022 305 New York State Department of Health, Communicable Disease Annual Reports, 2021, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/, accessed August 2022 306 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html, accessed August 2022 County Health Summaries 389 doubled in 2021 as compared to 2020 and reported cases of anaplasmosis nearly tripled.307 While not included in the NYSPA, tickborne disease remains an important focus for Putnam County. EMERGING ISSUES For this report, emerging issues are defined as health problems that did not flag based on the methodology described above but were instead identified based on other data sources or preliminary county data for 2020/2021 not included in NYS dashboards. Emerging issues include COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases (EID), STIs, opioid misuse, and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Similar to the nation, state, and neighboring counties, Putnam has been hit hard by COVID-19 for more than two years. The cumulative count of Putnam residents with positive test results reported through June of 2022 is 26,535, and the cumulative count of reported COVID-19 related deaths is 125. Weekly incidence has continued to exceed 200 cases in the summer of 2022.308 We are only now starting to understand and contend with impacts on the community that extend far beyond summary statistics, as evidenced by differences in results between the 2018 and 2022 Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Surveys summarized below. The pandemic also put a spotlight on long recognized deficits in the structure and capacity of the public health system to respond to pandemics and other EIDs that has in turn generated long lists of recommendations for change.309,310 Yet, change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and infections continue to emerge as is evidenced by the recent State Disaster Emergency Declaration made in response to the Monkeypox outbreak.311 While not included in the NYSPA, preparedness and response to COVID-19 and other emerging infections is an important priority for Putnam County. There has been a general upward trend in STIs in the M-H Region since 2014. While Putnam has not been as severely impacted as other counties in the region, upward trends are evident for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in Putnam data, particularly when preliminary case counts for 2021 are considered.312 It should be noted that there may be aberrations in 2020 data related to decreased health care seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly evident with chlamydia which is often diagnosed by screening asymptomatic patients. Stemming increasing rates of STIs remains an important priority for Putnam County. In the US, drug overdose deaths are rising, and opioids are the leading cause of drug overdoses. Similar to STIs, in many measures related to opioids Putnam has fared better than other counties in the region. However, when data presented in the M-H Regional CHA is supplemented with data available in the NYS Opioid Annual Data Report 2021, we see an increase from 2019 to 2020 in the rate of overdose deaths involving any opioid, heroin, and opioid pain relievers.313 Putnam will continue to prioritize harm reduction efforts to decrease mortality and morbidity due to opioid misuse. 307 PCDOH, unpublished data from the NYS Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System, accessed July 2022 308 PCDOH, 2022, https://www.putnamcountyny.com/health/covid19/coronavirus/, accessed August 2022 309 DeSalvo K, Hughes B, Bassett M, Benjamin G, Fraser M, Galea S, Garcia JN, and Howard J., National Academy of Medicine, 2021, https://nam.edu/public-health-covid-19-impact-assessment-lessons-learned-and-compelling-needs/, accessed August 2022 310 NYSACHO, 2021, https://www.nysacho.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IPR-report-FINAL.pdf, accessed August 2022 311 NYS Office of the Governor, 2022, https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-declares-state-disaster-emergency-response-ongoing-monkeypox-outbreak, accessed August 2022 312 PCDOH, unpublished data from the NYS Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System, accessed July 2022 313 New York State Department of Health, 2021, https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/opioid/data/pdf/nys_opioid_annual_report_2021.pdf, accessed July 2022 County Health Summaries 390 NYS data shows an increasing trend in frequency and duration of HABs at New York beaches.314 PCDOH tracks HAB detections and associated beach closures at the 32 public bathing beaches under its regulatory authority. In 2021 Putnam County had the highest number of times beaches closed (27), number of beaches closed (13), and number of lost beach days due to harmful blue-green algae blooms (314) of any county in NYS.315 From 2020 to 2021, HAB detections at regulated bathing beaches in Putnam increased 115% and number of lost swimming days increased by 183%.316 Weather patterns influence year-to-year fluctuation in HABs and the ongoing educational efforts of PCDOH Environmental Health Services may in part contribute to a high level of awareness and thus reporting of HABs in Putnam. Nonetheless, the frequency and duration of HABs in Putnam as compared to other counties is also likely related to the high density of housing with residential septic systems surrounding lakes. Recreational water bodies provide opportunities for physical activity and improve the quality of life for Putnam residents. Addressing issues with septic systems and preventing illnesses related to exposure to HABs is an important priority for Putnam County. COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE Major findings from the 777 Putnam County responses to the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey: \u2022 Except for access to public transportation, there is a more favorable opinion of community quality-of-life measures than in the region overall. However, declines in favorability were seen from 2018 survey results to 2022 survey results for ability to access healthy and nutritious food, childcare, mental health providers, and transportation. \u2022 There is a lower opinion of quality of information received from county agencies during public emergencies than in the region overall. \u2022 Self-reported ratings for physical and mental health were better than the region overall, but mental health ratings declined from 2018. Those living in a household with a disabled person, a person with long COVID-19, or income less than $50,000 had lower ratings for both physical and mental health. \u2022 Self-reported health behaviors were better than the region overall, but declines were seen from 2018 to 2022 in healthy eating, getting adequate sleep, and having quality social encounters. \u2022 Among the 75% of Putnam respondents who ever consume alcohol, 17% reported increased frequency of consumption as compared to pre-pandemic and 23% reported less frequent consumption. Among the 20% of Putnam respondents who ever use drugs for non-medical purpose, 17% reported increased frequency of drug use as compared to pre-pandemic and 12% reported less frequent drug use. \u2022 The level of stress reported on an average day increased from 2018 to 2022. Of respondents, stress levels were higher in females, those 35-54 years of age, employed persons, and those in households with children, a disabled person, a person with long COVID-19, or income greater than $150,000 per year. \u2022 As compared to the region overall, a lower proportion had trouble meeting basic needs such as food and housing in the past year, but there were disparities across demographic groups. A higher proportion of those who are age 18-34 years, non-White, renting their home, live in a household with a disabled person, or live in a household with income below $50,000 per year had trouble meeting four or more basic needs. 314 New York State Department of Health, 2022, https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/bluegreenalgae/beachsurveillance.htm, accessed July 2022 315 New York State Department of Health, 2022, https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/bluegreenalgae/beachsurveillance.htm, accessed July 2022 316 PCDOH, Unpublished data, accessed July 2022 County Health Summaries 391 \u2022 When asked to consider if various aspects of their lives had gotten better or worse over the course of the pandemic, the highest impact was seen in mental health (27% worsened) and the ability to obtain affordable, nutritious food (26% worsened). A higher proportion of those who have had long COVID-19 or have a household member that has had long COVID-19 reported worsened physical health, mental health, ability to obtain healthy food, ability to afford housing, and ability to care for a household member with a disability or chronic illness. \u2022 Among the 19% of respondents who were initially hesitant to receive a vaccination for COVID-19, the most common reason reported for eventually deciding to be vaccinated was learning more about the vaccine (36%). PCDOH also conducted a Community Priority Poll (CPP) to assess residents\u2019 opinions on health priorities and where resources should be focused to improve quality of life. The CPP was administered over social media and by paper ballot at PCDOH community engagement activities. The 135 respondents to the poll showed a preference for prioritization of health issues related to mental health and suicide (19%) and substance misuse (19%), with alignment of prioritization of resources for mental and social support services (16%). Aging and disability related issues was also commonly selected as a health priority (16%). The second and third most common choices for prioritization of resources were access to healthcare and preventative medicine (14%) and access to affordable housing (13%). CHIP creators should consider results of the CPP with the understanding that Spanish speakers were over-represented (27%) and that the small sample size is not generalizable to the whole population. ASSETS AND RESOURCES PCDOH has strong community partnerships that operate through a variety of channels: \u2022 Live Healthy Putnam is a coalition of community organizations and government agencies that meet quarterly to collaborate on population health initiatives, share resources, and cross promote programs. \u2022 PCDOH participates in a trio of task forces including the Communities that Care Coalition (substance misuse prevention), Suicide Prevention Task Force, and the Mental Health Providers Group. \u2022 Relationships between school districts and PCDOH were strengthened through extensive collaboration in disease prevention efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2022 Restaurants, camps, and recreational areas work closely with the Environmental Health Services Division to distribute health information and maintain safe environments. \u2022 Putnam County has an established network of emergency preparedness partners that includes a robust Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) with 130 active members and an Emergency Preparedness and Community Resilience Task Force. The Community Partner Resources survey was conducted to compile a directory of population health program resources available to county residents and facilitate matching of priorities identified in the CHA to resources that could be leveraged in the CHIP. Resources were categorized by the priority areas, focus areas, and goals outlined in the NYSPA. The survey found that services exist for all segments of the population, though the largest number of responding organizations provide services for the general population, adults, and adolescents. Population health activities have largely returned to pre-pandemic status, but some changes made in response to COVID-19, such as offering programs online rather than in person, have endured beyond the end of mandated restrictions. Resources exist in all NYSPA priority and focus areas but are not evenly distributed. The highest number of respondent organizations are working to prevent chronic disease. County Health Summaries 392 EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD To address and improve community health, PCDOH will submit a CHIP by the end of 2022. The plan will use the framework of the NYSPA to delineate focus areas within five major priority areas. The plan will also outline specific evidence-based interventions to address these focus areas and their evaluation measures. It will be informed by findings in the CHA and developed collaboratively by PCDOH and community partner organizations. This process will take place in the late summer through fall of 2022 and involve successive streamlining of focus areas and identification of potential linkages with existing resources for implementation of interventions. An internal PCDOH CHIP Work Group made up of members of the Health Education Division will complete an initial review, followed by evaluation by a CHIP Steering Committee consisting of PCDOH program staff and community partner organization leaders, including both clinical and non-clinical representatives from various fields such as mental health, chronic disease, environmental health, and more. An adapted nominal group technique alongside strategy grids will be utilized at the steering committee meeting to enhance objectivity and encourage consideration for urgency, need, feasibility, and impacts as factors that contribute to prioritization. The prioritization process will culminate in a Public Health Summit attended by elected and appointed officials, partners from community organizations such as not-for-profits, federally qualified health centers, faith-based groups, treatment centers, and various other key stakeholders. At the Summit, CHA findings will be presented and then stakeholder input will be gathered in breakout sessions. The Public Health Summit will then serve as a platform for further qualitative analysis of local resources and feasibility of program implementation through facilitated discussions within PA priority area-specific breakout sessions. Finally, PCDOH will work with individual partners to develop implementation plans for selected evidence-based interventions to include baseline, process, intermediate, and outcome measures. ROCKLAND COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY Rockland is the smallest county by land area and third most dense in NYS, outside of the five boroughs of NYC. It is home to an increasingly diverse population, with the third largest proportion of Hispanic residents, and the highest percentages of non-English speakers and Jewish residents in the M-H Region. The county population has shown steady growth annually, with the largest percentage increases observed in those 15 years and younger and those aged 50 years and older. Through this assessment it was identified that Rockland has the largest individual proportion of young people regionally with the greatest county percentage of population under five years old (8.4%), and under 18 years old (29.2%). Additionally, it is important to note that Rockland has the largest individual percentage of persons in poverty (14.4%) among the M-H Region counties, according to recent US Census Bureau data. Overall, the data related to Rockland County health outcomes reflects the core county population make-up, a highly diverse array of communities with unique yet interconnected health needs. Through the process of this M-H Regional CHA, gaps were identified among unique sub-segments of the population that could be minimized through the collaborative efforts of the county community health improvement plan (CHIP). Specialized attention is needed in several health focus areas to advance general wellness and improve overall health conditions throughout the county. AREAS OF FOCUS The greatest influence on overall morbidity and mortality among Rockland residents continues to be chronic illnesses, as has been the case for several years. A wide variety of factors play a role in the occurrence of these conditions, and it is an expressed goal among the county health partners to address the core issues driving the current trends. For instance, the rate of childhood and adolescent obesity continues to worsen in Rockland over County Health Summaries 393 the last few years. This was noted in the last community health assessment (CHA) and remains a problem to focus on in the next three years. Additionally, there is a clear disparity along racial and ethnic lines for broad categories of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, and asthma, when it comes to the ratios of preventable hospitalizations and premature deaths between non-Hispanic White residents and those that are either non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic. Prevention programs to reduce the impact of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and stroke will continue and be enhanced during this health improvement cycle to decrease the continuous detrimental influence of these conditions. The interventions are being developed to reach these special populations with culturally tailored programs, such as innovative school-based wellness enhancements, multi-lingual disease prevention, and self-management classes. Other areas that currently require attention with the same culturally sensitive lens are: \u2022 Increased rates of STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) \u2022 Lowest childhood immunization rates in the state \u2022 Poor cancer screening rates \u2022 Evidence of perinatal inequities by race/ethnicity (preterm birth and low birthweight infants) \u2022 Poor access and availability of mental health providers EMERGING ISSUES Certain health concerns in the M-H Region have advanced more rapidly in the last couple of years, progressing even faster than the data reviewed for this assessment can properly reflect due to standard reporting lag times and recent delays related to COVID-19. The factors influencing general public health have changed considerably and evolved in new directions since the last assessment of 2018. The general isolation and lack of available services experienced by residents during 2020 and 2021 allowed for unfortunate advancements in certain illnesses and conditions of concern. Most notably there has been a steady rise in STIs and a decrease in preventive care visits, impacting already troubled vaccination rates, cancer screening rates, and chronic illness prevention and maintenance visits. The available data sources show suboptimal child immunization rates (4:3:1:3:3:1:4) in certain school environments and among various pediatric providers throughout the county that have unfortunately allowed for recent increases in the occurrence of vaccine preventable disease outbreaks (measles, pertussis, mumps, polio). In 2021 Rockland County was noted as having the worst basic childhood immunization rates in NYS and community partners are now focused on working together to minimize the incidence and prevalence of these preventable illnesses going forward. Luckily, the ongoing COVID-19 response also supported greater cooperation and information dissemination across all sectors as a necessity of staying up to date with the changing guidance and response protocols. We have all weathered the tough early days of the pandemic together and in that time forged new and stronger community partnerships as a necessity. Important lines of communication and cooperation were established locally among a wider set of providers and community groups such as school district administrators, school nurses, religious leaders, town and village officials, urgent cares, pediatricians, and general medical practitioners. The community provider survey results from Rockland once again emphasized their concerns around racial and ethnic inequities with respect to health care access, particularly with mental health and substance use disorders and access to specialty care. There is now a concerted effort among these partners to address issues associated with access to health care, access to mental health care, increases in STI\u2019s, and low vaccination rates within several communities in the county. County Health Summaries 394 Some of the specific issues recognized are: \u2022 Low childhood vaccination rates and the occurrence of multiple outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases (measles, pertussis, polio, etc.) \u2022 Rise in STIs, namely syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia \u2022 Rise in child and adolescent obesity \u2022 Increase in the disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites when it comes to preventable hospitalizations \u2022 Increase in mortality related to suicide COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE \u2022 Most of the 765 respondents completing the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey reported that Rockland is a safe location to live, despite it being considered even less affordable when matched against the survey results from 2018. Respondents noted a greater concern over the costs of housing, childcare, and nutritious food options when compared against findings from three years ago. Once again residents noted that there are inadequate public transportation options and insufficient mental health providers available for the needs of residents. \u2022 Community service organizations were most concerned about minimal access to health providers; difficulties associated with public and private transportation; and a lack of affordable/nutritious food options available within all Rockland communities. They also expressed a fear over the low vaccination rates locally and the occurrence of disease outbreaks. \u2022 A majority of the 25 participants identified that the leading barriers to care are minimal public knowledge about existing resources, lack of health literacy among community providers, and substance use issues. ASSETS AND RESOURCES Rockland is a resource rich county, considering that it is so dense and in the heart of the New York Metropolitan Area. The local stakeholders in the county have historically been eager, focused, and engaged. This was clearly demonstrated in the assessment process for this document. It is expected that this level of involvement will continue, possibly even increase, through 2024 and beyond. In order to affect change in the county, a coalition of organizations has mobilized to develop and employ a wide array of interventions. Plans are in place to primarily utilize facilities and staff at Bon Secours Good Samaritan Hospital, Montefiore Nyack Hospital, and Rockland County Department of Health to support the community health improvement strategies. Assistance in these efforts is also expected from the FQHCs (Hudson River Health Care and Refuah), other county departments (Mental Health, Youth Bureau, Office of the Aging, Social Services, and Planning), as well as from the various CBOs that have assisted in developing this assessment. Several active village collectives (notably the Spring Valley Collaborative, the Haverstraw Collaborative, and the Western Ramapo Collaborative) meet regularly in Rockland and provide opportunities for community-based networking, intervention deployment, and resident level feedback. A variety of smaller cultural associations also exists in the county. Increasing inclusivity of these groups to better support the health needs of the entire population is an expressed goal in this improvement cycle. All of the organizations and collaborative groups mentioned above were critical in conducting this assessment, as they were the partners who provided critical input during the community health provider survey. Their feedback on the factors most influencing health and the leading barriers to care at the neighborhood level allowed for a unique health perspective. The survey of those groups provided a means to gather information on sub-populations that are typically underrepresented in random digit dial surveys like the one conducted by Siena County Health Summaries 395 College Research Institute (SCRI) in 2022. These public and community organizations were invited and asked to participate in a selection process for the determination of the highest priority PA areas to focus interventions within Rockland through 2024. EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD Based on the findings of the provider survey and through follow-up meetings with the key local medical facilities (hospitals and FQHCs), it was determined that the Rockland partners will focus on and track progress towards reducing concerns around the \u201cPreventing Chronic Diseases and the Promoting Well-Being\u201d and \u201cPreventing Communicable Disease\u201d PA priority areas. The detailed CHIP will be written to accompany this assessment and will contain higher level details about the measures to be addressed, but a couple of the key activities planned at the time of this assessment are: \u2022 Enhanced immunization action program services to increase the general rates of immunization among children and adults and to minimize the disparities seen across racial and ethnic groups. \u2022 Offering vaccines in locations and hours that are convenient to the public including pharmacies, vaccine-only clinics, and other sites that are accessible to people of all ages \u2022 Development and support of a wider selection of multi-cultural, multi-lingual chronic disease prevention and self-management programs to be delivered in novel community locations across the county. \u2022 Implementation of enhanced electronic medical records (EMR) capabilities across provider systems such that important reminders and referrals to specialists for chronic disease follow-up and cancer screening services become built in standards of care for Rockland residents. \u2022 The expansion of comprehensive nutritional and physical activity programs that support sustainable local school wellness activities. \u2022 Establishment of an enhanced CHIP tracking process to elevate effectiveness and accountability of collaborating organizations. This is a carry-over goal that was not met in the previous cycle due to limitations created by the COVID-19 pandemic. SULLIVAN COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY Sullivan County is a geographically large rural county comprised of roughly 79,806 people (July 1, 2021 Census estimates), spread out over 997 square miles with 81.2 people per square mile. It is located approximately 90 miles northwest of NYC in the Catskill Mountains. Residents of Sullivan County are primarily White (83.8%) and English speaking, although there is a growing Hispanic/Latino population, which comprises 17.4% of the population, and 10.2% Black. Approximately 9.5% of residents are foreign born and 15.8% speak a language other than English as their primary language. The county is known for its rich history, especially in tourism, and natural beauty of lakes, rivers, and mountains. While Sullivan County has struggled for decades economically, improvement was happening before the COVID-19 pandemic. New businesses, including a casino, health spa and indoor water park, had led to an increase in jobs and an unemployment rate that fell to 3.3% in 2019. Post COVID-19 pandemic unemployment rates have increased to 8.8% in 2020, which is still lower than the high of 10.4% in 2010. The median household income for 2020 was $60,433 with a per capita income of $32,346. Both of these have increased since the last community health assessment in 2019, but still fall below the national averages of $64,994 and $35,384, respectively. The poverty rate for 2020 was 12.7%, above the national poverty level of 11.4%. Sullivan County is the only county that is completely rural in the M-H Region. The rural landscape and geographical distance that many people live County Health Summaries 396 from health care providers, hospitals, or emergency rooms influence the poor health factors and health outcomes that have affected Sullivan County for years. Large areas of the county, especially in the western and northern ends, are very remote and lack access to public transportation as well as access to medical providers and services. AREAS OF FOCUS In Sullivan County, the leading causes of death and premature death (death before age 75) include cancer, heart disease, unintentional injury, CLRD, and diabetes. Obesity continues to contribute to many of these leading causes of death, as well as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. In Sullivan County, according to 2018 BRFSS data, 69.9% of residents were overweight or obese, compared to 61.4% of M-H Region residents. Reported childhood obesity rates have remained steady, with a decrease in the percentage of overweight or obese children in the county\u2019s elementary schools (2017 SWSCRS data). Premature death rates related to CVD have improved, but premature death rate for heart disease (101.7 per 100,000) remains higher than both the M-H Region (65.9) and NYS (83.9). Unintentional injury mortality rates have dramatically increased from 51.4 per 100,000 in 2016 to 75.4 per 100,000 in 2019 and is the highest rate in the state according to 2019 data. This is most likely due in part to the high rates of drug overdose deaths. Sullivan County\u2019s overdose death rate for any drug is 43.3 per 100,000, the highest in NYS. All of these factors lead to Sullivan County having a premature death rate of 49.3%, second highest in the state after the Bronx. \u2022 The 2018 rate for newborns with neonatal withdrawal symptoms and/or affected by maternal substance use (43.6 per 1,000 newborn discharges) remains significantly higher than the M-H Region (8.2 per 1,000 discharges) and is one of the highest rates in the state. \u2022 The percentage of women getting screened for breast cancer (55.3%) remains lower than the M-H Region (65.9%) and NYS (71%). \u2022 Only 67.7% of women received early prenatal care, compared to 76.3% in NYS. \u2022 The percentage of Medicaid enrollees aged 2-20 years who had at least one preventative dental visit within the past year decreased from 2016-2019. \u2022 The number of primary care physicians per 100,000 population in Sullivan County is 34, compared to the NYS number of 84 per 100,000. \u2022 The monthly median gross rent increased, as well as the percentage of the renter occupied units in which rent is 30% or more of household income. EMERGING ISSUES \u2022 Increasing STI rates, including chlamydia and gonorrhea \u2022 Opioid related deaths, hospitalizations, and overall opioid burden \u2022 Increase in tickborne illness, as well as increasing severity of tickborne disease and increasing number of hospitalizations for tickborne illnesses \u2022 Decreasing numbers of providers and accessibility to medical services \u2022 Increasing suicide mortality rates, especially among those aged 15-19 years \u2022 Non-motor vehicle injury mortality rates \u2022 Increasing population \u2022 Electronic vaping use among teens County Health Summaries 397 \u2022 Increasing child and adolescent mortality rates \u2022 Emergence of vaccine preventable diseases COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE Sullivan County participated in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Survey in partnership with the six other M-H Region LHDs, Garnet Catskills, and SCRI to collect data from 641 county residents to help better understand and characterize the needs of the community. Below are data points of note: \u2022 87% of respondents believed people may have a hard time finding a quality place to live due to the high cost of housing \u2022 77% of respondents believed parents struggle to find affordable, quality childcare \u2022 78% did not believe people can get where they need to go using public transportation \u2022 26% of respondents did not visit a primary care doctor in the past 12 months for a routine physical or a check-up \u2022 43% of respondents did not see a dentist in the past 12 months for a routine check-up or cleaning and 26% of those who didn\u2019t go to the dentist stated they didn\u2019t go because they didn\u2019t have insurance \u2022 61% of respondents had a tele-health appointment with a healthcare provider during COVID-19 \u2022 28% replied their ability to obtain affordable food that is nutritious worsened \u2022 80% responded they had been vaccinated for COVID-19 ASSETS AND RESOURCES Sullivan County Department of Public Health has strong community partnerships with many organizations serving the residents of the county. Our partnerships include the local community hospital, two FQHCs, three urgent care centers, and many CBOs serving the needs of Sullivan County residents. Sullivan County Department of Public Health also leads the Sullivan County Rural Health Network and plays a major role in the Sullivan County Drug Task Force. Sullivan County government continues to invest in \u201cMove Sullivan\u201d to expand access to affordable public transportation for Sullivan County residents. These partnerships will be leveraged to address the heath care areas of focus and emergent health issues for the CHA/CHIP cycle 2022-2024. EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD In addition to participating in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, a service provider survey, medical provider survey, and community focus groups were convened in conjunction with the Rural Health Network, Sullivan 180, and Health Service Advisory Board to collect data from area providers and members of the community. A total of 36 responses were collected from providers. Responses from each focus group were aggregated to represent the opinions of the community members present. The top three issues impacting the health of Sullivan County residents were: access to medical providers and mental health providers; access to affordable, decent, and safe housing; and access to affordable, reliable public transportation. In the same surveys, the top three barriers to people achieving better health in Sullivan County were: drug and/or alcohol use, knowledge of existing resources, and geographic location (living in a rural area). Significant findings from the groups included: County Health Summaries 398 \u2022 Lack of medical services and providers was an area of concern for participants. Consolidation of medical providers into medical care organizations has left many rural areas of the county without basic medical access. \u2022 Transportation remains a barrier to accessing basic services. Move Sullivan has helped to remove barriers, but many areas of the county still do not have access to transportation. \u2022 Health literacy and a lack of assistance in helping patients understand insurance or their medical conditions was identified by providers as a barrier to improving health. \u2022 Access to affordable, nutritious food was an issue impacting health. \u2022 58% of service providers indicated that chronic disease highly impacts the health of residents. Sullivan County Department of Public Health will continue to collaborate with community partners to develop areas of focus and strategies for the 2022-2024 CHIP. ULSTER COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY Ulster County is located in the southeastern part of NYS, south of Albany and immediately west of the Hudson River. According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,161 square miles, which is approximately the size of Rhode Island. Much of Ulster County can be characterized as suburban and semi-rural, with only one major urban area, the city of Kingston, which is in the eastern central portion of the county and encompasses just 7.4 square miles of the county\u2019s total area. Ulster County is part of the Kingston Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the latest estimates available from the US Census Bureau, Ulster County\u2019s population was 182,951 in 2021. The total number of households was 70,088 and the household median income was approximately $65,306. AREAS OF FOCUS The data analyzed points to several areas of focus for Ulster County. Ulster County has an exceptionally high suicide mortality rate, including among teens and older adults; a high percentage of children and adults who are overweight or obese; an unacceptably high rate of maternal mortality; and opioid related prescription, fatality and emergency department visit rates that are well above the M-H Region and NYS averages. Other areas of concern: \u2022 Diabetes mortality and hospitalization rates are high, even though the incidence rate is among the lowest in the M-H Region. \u2022 The percentage of adults aged 45 years and older who have had a test for high blood sugar or diabetes is lower than those of the M-H Region and NYS excluding NYC. \u2022 In the past year, 23% of women aged 18-44 years in Ulster County have not had a preventative medical screening. \u2022 The percentage of adults with an annual household income less than $25,000 with perceived food security was only 54.7%, slightly lower than the M-H Region and NYS averages, yet still unacceptably high. \u2022 According to the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, 92% of people said it was \u201ccompletely true\u201d or \u201csomewhat true\u201d that it is difficult to find a quality place to live due to the high cost of housing. The Mid-County Health Summaries 399 Hudson Community Partner Survey also confirmed that this is a top issue affecting the people of Ulster County. \u2022 The resident survey and Mid-Hudson Community Partner Survey both indicated that access to mental health providers is a major challenge, which corresponds to regional, state, and national trends, followed by access to affordable and reliable public transportation. \u2022 The crash-related pedestrian fatality rate per 100,000 population in Ulster County is significantly higher than both the M-H Region and NYS excluding NYC.\nEMERGING ISSUES The housing crisis throughout Ulster County has grown significantly worse over the last five years. This can be attributed to the limited construction of new, affordable rental and ownership units and the associated inflated costs of building materials and labor. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many NYC Metropolitan area individuals and families to seek weekend and permanent residences, which have increased demand and prices for affordable housing. The expanding tourism industry in Ulster County has also resulted in many previously available and affordable housing units being converted into short-term rentals. Several municipalities in the county have adopted regulations to address this; however, the shortage of available housing units continues to grow. Affordable, healthy, and safe housing is the foundation upon which individuals, families, and the community build their strength, wellness and resiliency and county leadership from every sector has recognized the urgency of immediate action in this area. Although cigarette use in the county has slightly decreased over time, Ulster County\u2019s adult smoking rate (21%) is still higher than the M-H Region and NYS averages. The use of electronic vapor products, also known as e-cigarettes or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), has increased. Approximately one-third of all adult residents in Ulster County (30%) have tried e-cigarettes or other vaping products in the past, and 17% currently use e-cigarettes, a significant increase from 11% when first measured in the county in 2018.\nCOMMUNITY SURVEY DATA POINTS OF NOTE As part of the CHA process, the Ulster County Department of Health (UCDOH) participated in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey in partnership with the six other M-H Region LHDs to collect data on over 600 Ulster County residents to help better characterize the needs of the community. Below are data points of note: \u2022 92% of Ulster County residents responded, \u201ccompletely true\u201d or \u201csomewhat true\u201d to the statement, \u201cPeople may have a hard time finding a quality place to live due to the high cost of housing.\u201d \u2022 26% of Ulster County residents answered, \u201cnot very true\u201d or \u201cnot at all true\u201d to the statement, \u201cMost people are able to access affordable food that is healthy and nutritious.\u201d \u2022 66% of Ulster County residents responded, \u201ccompletely true\u201d or \u201csomewhat true\u201d to the statement, \u201cParents struggle to find affordable, quality childcare.\u201d \u2022 49% of Ulster County residents responded, \u201cnot very true\u201d or \u201cnot at all true\u201d to the statement, \u201cThere are sufficient, quality mental health providers.\u201d \u2022 50% of Ulster County residents responded, \u201cnot very true\u201d or \u201cnot at all true\u201d to the statement, \u201cPeople can get where they need to using public transportation.\u201d County Health Summaries 400 \u2022 98% of Ulster County residents with household income of less than $50K had not visited a dentist for a routine check-up or cleaning in the last 12 months \u2022 50% of Ulster County residents with household income of less than $50K rated their mental health as fair or poor. \u2022 46% of Ulster County residents with household income of less than $50K rated their physical health as fair or poor. In addition to participating in the Mid-Hudson Region Community Health Survey, a Community Partner Survey was conducted in the spring and early summer of 2022. The survey collected data from health and human services providers that serve underrepresented populations, including low-income, veterans, persons experiencing homelessness, the aging population, LGBTQIA+ community, and people with a mental health diagnosis or substance use disorder. Of the 40 responses collected, the three underlying issues that impact the health of the populations served by their agencies were identified as follows: access to affordable, decent, and safe housing; access to mental health providers; and access to affordable, reliable public transportation. UCDOH also created a CHA Snapshot and reviewed the most current secondary data indicators available from a wide variety of federal, state, regional, and local data sources for Ulster County, the M-H Region, and NYS. This was provided at the Ulster County PA Leadership Team Meetings for review in 2022. Over 21 partners, including hospitals, health care providers, and CBOs reviewed the most current data, selected the two PA Priorities for the 2022-2024 CHIP, and discussed both assets and barriers to addressing the selected priority areas. ASSETS AND RESOURCES UCDOH has strong community partnerships with hundreds of organizations serving its residents, including two area hospitals, FQHCs, private medical providers, local two-year and four-year colleges, a medical school, CBOs, and regional organizations serving a broad variety of community needs. UCDOH and the Ulster County Department of Mental Health have established multiple coalitions, including Healthy Ulster Council, Integrated Ulster, Ulster County Human Services Coalition, Ulster County Suicide Prevention Coalition, Ulster County Opioid Prevention Strategic Action Leadership Team, Ulster County Legislature Workforce Housing Committee, and Ulster County Public Health Preparedness Task Force. In addition to participating in many public health focused coalitions, UCDOH also participates in Live Well Kingston, Ellenville Rural Health Network, Mano-a-Mano (Hispanic coalition), Bringing Agencies Together, Ulster County Healthy Families, Maternal Infant Services Network, Ulster Prevention Council, and Tobacco Free Action Communities, among others. These coalitions\u2019 partners and others are mobilized to address the health areas of focus and emerging issues of the 2022-2024 CHA/CHIP cycle. EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD \u2022 Ulster County continues to implement its comprehensive and integrated strategic action plan to address the opioid epidemic. A dramatic expansion of harm reduction services, access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT), connections to care and intermediate and long-term support services has already reduced opioid overdose fatalities by 50% in 2022 compared to the same time in 2021. Much more work needs to be done in this area to achieve acceptable and sustained results. County Health Summaries 401 \u2022 Ulster County continues to make significant improvements in the built environment through a combination of federal, state, and local funds. These include ongoing development of a world-class rail trail system throughout the county, pedestrian and bike friendly complete street initiatives, safe routes to schools, and others. All are designed to encourage physical activity, improve access to fresh and healthier foods, and increased social engagement to help prevent chronic diseases. This will also continue to reduce our carbon footprint, while reducing air pollution. \u2022 Ulster County will continue to build on a strong foundation of tobacco prevention policy change by updating legislation to further strengthen regulations designed to protect youth and low income and minority populations from the impacts of tobacco marketing and increasing the awareness of the risks of tobacco and vaping products. \u2022 Ulster County has strengthened the availability of and access to mental health services with the establishment of a walk-in mental health clinic and a soon to be constructed crisis stabilization center. \u2022 Ulster County has established and will continue to develop an innovative Community Smart Housing Initiative designed to help and connect local municipalities as they develop and implement Housing Action Plans. These will include zoning amendments, financial incentives, innovative regulations, and other state of the art tools to increase the number of affordable housing units for low and middle-income residents. \u2022 There are many other health initiatives that Ulster County will be involved to monitor and enhance the progress of public health. More details are available in the Ulster County CHIP. WESTCHESTER COUNTY HEALTH SUMMARY With an area of about 450 square miles, Westchester County is located just north of New York City. It is bordered on the west by the Hudson River, on the north by Putnam County, and on the east by the Long Island Sound and Connecticut\u2019s Fairfield County. With its six cities, 19 towns, and 23 villages, Westchester is the home to a mix of urban and suburban communities. According to the 2016-2020 American Community Survey, the total population residing in Westchester is 968,738, with 48.4% males and 51.6% females. Among them, 61.7% are non-Hispanic White, 14.8% non-Hispanic Black, 6.2% non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and 11.7% are of some other race. Just under a quarter of its population is of Hispanic origin and 25.4% of the population is foreign born. About one-third of the residents speak a non-English language at home. The majority of Westchester residents over the age of 25 have received a high school diploma/GED and almost half have obtained a college and/or beyond college education. The overall unemployment rate is 5.7%. The median household income is estimated at $99,489. While an affluent county in general, there are pockets of communities living in less desirable conditions. About 8.4% of the population lives in poverty, with higher poverty rates among the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations. About 3.9% of the residents are living in overcrowded housing. Rather than driving alone, 43% of the population uses an alternative mode of transportation for the commute to work, including carpooling, public transportation, walking, bicycling, or telecommuting. County Health Summaries 402 AREA OF FOCUS AND EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD Given the complexity of Westchester County\u2019s geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic compositions, Westchester County Department of Health extended the Regional Community Health Assessment Survey by reaching out to low-income and minority populations with paper-form and online surveys. The extended CHA survey collected information from an additional 1,109 respondents and presented a complex picture with regard to Westchester\u2019s current health status, its emerging health issues, as well as potential areas of focus that the Health Department and collaborative local agencies may provide services to enhance the county\u2019s health. In terms of identifying the department priorities and areas of focus, Westchester County elected to host and facilitate a series of virtual forums with community partners and providers in lieu of a provider survey. The benefits of engaging in these community conversations provided an opportunity to share and discuss the community health assessment (CHA) findings, garner input on currently available and needed assets and resources, identify competing priorities, and establish and convene formal and informal cross-sector partnerships and coalitions to more efficiently share resources and collaboratively address service gaps, barriers to health, and the root causes of inequity. A wide array of organizations was invited to participate in the forums, including hospital systems, federally funded health centers, mental health agencies, local non-profit community organizations, peer support programs, food pantries, faith-based organizations, local coalitions, school leaders, senior programs, municipality leaders, early intervention and childcare service providers, and others. Based on the striking findings from the regional and the extended CHA surveys about the racial disparities in most of the areas probed, there is a general consensus on addressing priorities and focus areas through the lens of racial disparity. ASSETS AND RESOURCES Westchester County has a rich supply of assets and resources that support the health and well-being of its residents. Some examples include: \u2022 Ample green spaces as well as County and State parks providing about 98% of the population with access to outdoor recreation and exercise opportunities \u2022 Extensive health care systems, including hospitals, federally qualified health cares, urgent care centers, and laboratories, operating within the county providing timely and state-of-art direct health care \u2022 A large number of colleges and universities located within the county providing opportunities for health education \u2022 The extensive Bee-Line bus system serving over 27 million passengers annually, providing transportation services to over 65% of all Westchester County residents and workplaces with walking distance to a Bee-Line bus route, making the bus both close and convenient \u2022 United Way's 211 information and referral system contains information on non-profit organizations for many communities in Westchester \u2022 A variety of community organizations, task forces, coalitions, and other agencies working on providing direct services as well as policy and structural change within the county.

The United States is experiencing a behavioral health crisis: while the number of people with mental health conditions and substance use disorders is rising, many people cannot easily access the treatment they need.\n\nTwo major contributors to this crisis are the shortage of behavioral health providers and limited insurance coverage for the services they provide. As in other areas of health care, people of color face more obstacles to behavioral health care than white people do, which [worsens existing racial disparities](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/racism-apology).\n\n## What is integrated behavioral health care, and how can it help?\n\nAlthough behavioral health and physical health are [deeply intertwined](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42940/9241591595.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), medical and behavioral health services in the U.S. are delivered in separate, poorly coordinated systems. As a result, people can sometimes experience [years-long delays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361014/) between the onset of symptoms and treatment.\n\nSome providers are testing new ways of delivering care that integrate behavioral health with primary care. In [integrated practices](https://integrationacademy.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Lexicon.pdf), a team of primary care and behavioral health providers work together with patients and families to deliver care that addresses mental health, substance use, and other medical needs. This holistic model differs from classic care models in which primary care providers (PCPs) refer patients to behavioral health providers when a need is identified but do not continuously coordinate their care.\n\nEfforts to integrate care can vary widely. Still, several [common elements](https://nam.edu/components-of-the-next-generation-of-integrated-care/) exist across models, including:\n\n* team-based care, where multiple types of providers collaborate to address a range of patient care needs\n* universal screening for common behavioral and physical health disorders\n* shared information systems, such as electronic health records, to improve coordination across providers while maintaining patient privacy\n* measurement of patient outcomes using patient registries or tracking tools\n* engagement with social and community behavioral health services, such as opioid use treatment programs\n* individualized, person-centered care that incorporates family members and caregivers into the treatment plan.\n\nIntegrated care spans a continuum, which means practices can ramp up their integration efforts based on their current capabilities.\n\n## How can integrated care promote equitable access to behavioral health services?\n\nIntegrated care is vital for expanding access to behavioral health services. Given the widespread barriers to accessing specialty behavioral health care \u2014 including [provider shortages](https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas), high out-of-pocket costs, and gaps in insurance coverage \u2014 many people are already seeking behavioral health treatment from their PCPs. However, PCPs often feel unprepared to manage patients\u2019 mental health or [substance use concerns](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27164025/), especially when their [conditions are more severe](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2015/dec/primary-care-physicians-ten-countries-report-challenges). Integrated care equips PCPs and associated providers with effective tools for diagnosis and treatment, while also expanding the workforce to include paraprofessionals \u2014 community health workers or peer support specialists \u2014 who offer counseling, care management, social support, and skill-building services. This approach has been shown to improve behavioral health [access](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3966503/) and [outcomes](https://www.jabfm.org/content/30/2/130) across age groups and diagnoses.\n\nIntegration is also an important strategy for addressing racial, ethnic, and geographic behavioral health disparities. For people of color, integrated care can address many of the barriers that [disproportionately limit their use](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2021/oct/mental-health-care-needs-us-10-other-high-income-countries-survey) of behavioral health services compared with their white counterparts. For example, being able to get behavioral health services in the offices of a trusted primary care provider can ease the [stigma of seeking treatment](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08964-3) that can be a barrier to care for some people of color. In [rural communities](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/fsh-fsh0000352.pdf), where provider shortages tend to be severe, integration can help increase access by leveraging local providers more efficiently, incorporating telemedicine to fill gaps, and promoting collaboration with community services.\n\nUltimately, health systems are more likely to find success with integrated care models that are tailored to the [cultural and linguistic needs](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201400581) and preferences of their local community.\n\n## What are the challenges to widespread integration?\n\n*Workforce.* Despite the potential for integration to address provider shortages, states and health systems do not engage paraprofessionals to their full potential. Currently, 39 states allow Medicaid reimbursement for peer support specialists, and Medicare covers only [traditional behavioral health providers](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mental-health-care-outpatient). Despite limited coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, [paraprofessionals can reduce staffing shortages](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2022/mar/testimony-ensuring-access-behavioral-health-care-making-integrated-care) and patient access barriers, expand the capabilities of integrated care teams, and promote patient-centered care.\n\nTraining and licensing burdens further strain the workforce. Treatment for opioid use disorder, specifically prescribing buprenorphine, requires extensive provider training to [obtain the necessary waiver](https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/become-buprenorphine-waivered-practitioner). In 2018, less than 4 percent of physicians had received this waiver. Among physicians who can prescribe buprenorphine, few do, often because of [lack of support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379718300746) at the practice level and inadequate reimbursement. While the types of providers who are eligible for this waiver have been expanded, the burden of training and subsequent lack of support continues to limit access to this treatment.\n\n*Technology.* Successful integration requires [communication and collaboration](https://integrationacademy.ahrq.gov/about/integrated-behavioral-health/telehealth) between PCPs, behavioral health providers, and patients. Technology, including telehealth (virtual visits with a provider) and integrated communication systems (electronic health systems and other health information technology that supports interoperability), can help, enabling providers in different locations to communicate with one another and increase access for patients who can\u2019t get to a provider.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began and reimbursement policies changed, telehealth use by patients and providers has jumped. Still, [high-speed internet access remains a problem](https://www.shvs.org/expanding-equitable-telehealth-access-federal-funding-opportunities-to-support-universal-broadband/) in rural and some urban areas. Certain treatments for substance use disorders also require an initial in-person visit. Moreover, certain policies that have made it easier for providers to be reimbursed for delivering telehealth services are set to expire once the COVID public health emergency ends.\n\n## How do we pay for the integration of behavioral health with primary care?\n\nProvider payment is a significant barrier to integration. The fee-for-service payment system that predominates in the United States disincentivizes integrated care by reimbursing providers for individual services instead of the whole-care experience. In cases where reimbursements have been designated for integrated care, like the collaborative care model reimbursement codes used in Medicare, current payment levels [aren\u2019t always enough to cover](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BPC_Behavioral-Health-Integration-report_R03.pdf) the cost of care. Providers in some states also are challenged by [same-day billing restrictions](https://blog.nachc.org/same-day-billing-policies-affect-health-centers-and-patients/), which limit reimbursements to either primary care or behavioral health services in a single visit.\n\nFurther, the immense startup costs practices face as they change workflows, hire and train staff, upgrade technologies, and launch new quality improvement processes are not reimbursable. Even after implementing integrated care models, current payment approaches may not allow providers to immediately recoup these costs.\n\nDespite these cost burdens, integrated care can [generate savings](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BPC_Behavioral-Health-Integration-report_R03.pdf), and rethinking how we pay for this care is an important step to realizing them. Value-based payments, which incentivize and hold providers accountable for the quality of care, have been used to promote integration, generate cost savings, and improve quality. Several integrated care models have moved away from traditional fee-for-service payments to payments that are linked to quality and value, including [episode-based, bundled payments](https://www.thekennedyforum.org/app/uploads/2017/09/Payment-Reform-and-Opportunities-for-Behavioral-Health-Alternative-Payment-Model-Examples-Final.pdf) in Minnesota and [capitated payments that incentivize integration](https://www.chcs.org/media/behavioral-health-provider-participation-in-medicaid-value-based-payment-models-an-environmental-scan-and-policy-considerations.pdf) and quality improvement in Massachusetts. When implementing new payment models to support integration, it\u2019s important that incentives are well aligned to promote sustainable integration.\n\nIntegration offers a way to address the country\u2019s growing behavioral health crisis while advancing health equity. But making integrated care the norm, rather than the exception, will require the shared commitment of policymakers, payers, and providers to invest in systems change.\n\nPublication Details\n\nDate\n\nContact\n\nCelli Horstman, Senior Research Associate, Improving Care Delivery, The Commonwealth Fund\n\n [[email\u00a0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2142444961424c56470f4e5346)\n\nCitation\n\nCelli E.

Participants consisted of all adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with primary care visits from January 2015 to July 2018. Data were analyzed from August 2018 to March 2021.\n\n**Interventions**The implementation intervention included 3 strategies: practice facilitation; electronic health record decision support; and performance feedback. Practices were randomly assigned launch dates, which placed them in 1 of 7 waves and defined the start of the practice\u2019s intervention period.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**Coprimary outcomes for prevention and AUD treatment were (1) the proportion of patients who had unhealthy alcohol use and brief intervention documented in the electronic health record (_brief intervention_) for prevention and (2) the proportion of patients who had newly diagnosed AUD and engaged in AUD treatment (_AUD treatment engagement_). Analyses compared monthly rates of primary and intermediate outcomes (eg, screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation) among all patients who visited primary care during usual care and intervention periods using mixed-effects regression.\n\n**Results**A total of 333 596 patients visited primary care (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 193 583 [58%] female; 234 764 [70%] White individuals). The proportion with brief intervention was higher during SPARC intervention than usual care periods (57 vs 11 per 10 000 patients per month; _P_< .001). The proportion with AUD treatment engagement did not differ during intervention and usual care (1.4 vs 1.8 per 10 000 patients; _P_ = .30). The intervention increased intermediate outcomes: screening (83.2% vs 20.8%; _P_< .001), new AUD diagnosis (33.8 vs 28.8 per 10 000; _P_ = .003), and treatment initiation (7.8 vs 6.2 per 10 000; _P_ = .04).\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized implementation trial, the SPARC intervention resulted in modest increases in prevention (brief intervention) but not AUD treatment engagement in primary care, despite important increases in screening, new diagnoses, and treatment initiation.\n\n**Trial Registration**ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT02675777](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02675777)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Introduction \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nUnhealthy alcohol use\u2014the spectrum from drinking above recommended limits to alcohol use disorder (AUD)\u2014is neglected in medical settings despite its effect on morbidity and mortality.[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1)-[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1) Of US adults, 20% to 25% drink at unhealthy levels,[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r5) and 14% have a current AUD.[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r6)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nEvidence-based prevention of unhealthy alcohol use includes population-based screening and brief counseling for unhealthy alcohol use (_brief intervention_) aimed at reducing drinking.[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1),[7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r7) Brief interventions are recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1) and are ranked one of the highest prevention priorities based on potential improvement in population health.[8](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r8) Evidence-based AUD treatment includes counseling[9](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r9)-[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r9) and medications,[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r11)-[13](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r11) and observational research supports the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous.[14](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r14) The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recommends treatment initiation within 14 days of diagnosing AUD and treatment engagement within the following month.[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r15) Despite the evidence for prevention and AUD treatment, most patients (approximately 90%) with unhealthy alcohol use do not receive recommended care.[7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r7),[16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r16)-[19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r16)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe Sustained Patient-Centered Alcohol-Related Care (SPARC) trial was a stepped-wedge cluster randomized implementation trial with data collected from 2015 to 2018 and that was designed to improve (1) population-based alcohol-related prevention and (2) AUD treatment across 22 primary care practices ([NCT02675777](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02675777)).[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) The prevention objective was to test whether\u2014compared with usual care\u2014the SPARC intervention increased the proportion of primary care patients who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use and had documented brief intervention.

Each practice had a randomly assigned intervention launch date which placed the practice into 1 of 7 waves, with waves staggered by 4-month intervals.[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) The months before and after the launch date are referred to as _usual care_ and _SPARC intervention_ periods, respectively.[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) Patients could contribute data to usual care and/or SPARC intervention periods depending on when they visited primary care.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Intervention \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe SPARC intervention was designed to implement the following clinical care: population-based annual alcohol screening with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT-C),[28](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r28) brief intervention for patients who screened positive (AUDIT-C \u2265 3 for women; AUDIT-C \u2265 4 for men),[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1) assessment with an Alcohol Symptom Checklist for _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (Fifth Edition) (_DSM-5_) AUD if high-risk drinking (AUDIT-C \u2265 7),[25](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r25),[29](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r29),[30](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r30) shared decision-making about AUD treatment options[31](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r31) with a primary care practitioner or integrated licensed social worker,[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) and support for initiation and engagement in AUD treatment ([Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090f1); eAppendix 2[32](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r32) in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)). The intervention included 3 evidence-based implementation strategies (eAppendix 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)).[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) Two strategies\u2014EHR clinical decision support and performance feedback\u2014were used previously in the Veterans Health Administration for implementing alcohol-related prevention,[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r33) and the third\u2014practice facilitation[34](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r34)\u2014was added to address limitations of those prior Veterans Affairs implementation efforts.[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r35)_Practice facilitation_ supported local implementation teams at each practice for approximately 6 months\u20142 months before randomly assigned launch dates (preparation phase) and 4 months after launch (active support phase). Local implementation teams, including leaders, clinicians, and staff, had weekly meetings with a practice facilitator using Plan-Do-Check-Adjust (PDCA) cycles. Practice facilitators offered expertise in alcohol-related care, addressed stigma, encouraged patient-centered shared decision-making for AUD,[31](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r31) and provided and/or arranged trainings to address all elements of behavioral health integration: a 1-hour orientation for all primary care staff, and separate 1-hour trainings for primary care practitioners and nurses, and medical assistants and front desk staff. The _EHR clinical decision support_ included EHR prompts for screening, assessment of AUD symptoms, and treatment initiation; there was inadequate leadership support to include prompts for practitioners to document brief intervention or engage patients in treatment. The target date for activating EHR prompts was the randomized launch date. _Performance feedback_ reported on the prevalence of screening and assessment of AUD symptoms, calculated weekly by study programmers starting after intervention launch,[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) and NCQA treatment initiation metrics starting 2 months after intervention launch. Throughout the trial, formative evaluation meetings with practice facilitators identified barriers and facilitators leading to refinements of implementation activities.[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) After practice facilitation ended (sustainment phase), health system leaders conducted monthly PDCA cycle meetings with each practice.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\nFigure 1.

Randomization was stratified by year: year 1 (y1) sites were randomized into 3 waves; year 2-3 (y2) sites were randomized later (after study start) into 4 waves. The study biostatistician completed stratified random assignment using a computer-generated list of random numbers; within each year (y1 vs y2), each site had equal probability of assignment to each wave. (Blinding clinics was not possible.)[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Measures \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe SPARC trial had coprimary implementation outcomes reflecting processes of care, one for prevention and one for AUD treatment, and multiple secondary explanatory outcomes. All outcomes were defined using a denominator of all patients with an in-person primary care visit each _month_ (consecutive 28-day periods) to avoid identification bias.[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21),[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r36),[37](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r37)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Primary Outcome Measures \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Brief Intervention \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe numerator for the primary outcome for prevention (hereafter referred to as _brief intervention_) was the presence of both a positive alcohol screen (defined previously) on the day of a primary care visit or in the prior year and EHR-documented brief intervention within the next 14 days. Brief intervention was identified by 1 or more of 3 EHR data elements available in usual care and SPARC intervention periods (eAppendix 3 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)): _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision (ICD-9/ICD-10)_ diagnostic or procedure codes for brief intervention; clinical documentation of brief intervention templates identified by natural language processing and confirmed by manual review; and orders for a booklet about unhealthy alcohol use.[38](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r38)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Treatment Engagement for AUD \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe numerator for the primary outcome for AUD treatment was the presence of both a new AUD diagnosis on the day of a primary care visit (with no AUD diagnosis in the prior 365 days) and subsequent in-person treatment initiation and engagement. Initiation required an _ICD-9/ICD-10_ code from NCQA\u2019s alcohol or drug quality measure[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r15) within 14 days after the new AUD diagnosis; engagement required 2 more visits with alcohol or drug _ICD-9/ICD-10_ codes within 30 days following initiation.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Secondary Outcome Measures \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nSecondary intermediate outcomes identified a priori included AUDIT-C screening; positive screens; high positive screens that prompted assessment with an Alcohol Symptom Checklist; completion of an Alcohol Symptom Checklist; new AUD diagnoses, and AUD treatment initiation.[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) In addition, alternative measures of brief intervention and AUD treatment (including medications) were evaluated (eAppendix 4 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)).[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r15),[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21),[39](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r39)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Covariates \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nPatient-level covariates were defined on the day of the first visit during usual care or SPARC intervention period(s).

Crossover of patients from SPARC to usual care periods was described.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nFollowing prespecified analysis plans,[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) primary analyses compared outcome rates during 1-month intervals in usual care and SPARC periods across all 19 sites. Specifically, binary indicators for whether a patient seen in primary care at a site during a particular month had an outcome in that month were modeled using mixed-effects logistic regression models.[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) The models included an indicator for whether the site was in the usual care or SPARC intervention period in that month, and adjusted for stratification (y2 vs y1) and calendar time (indicator variable for each 4 months). Additionally, person-level and site-level random effects accounted for correlation of repeated outcomes from the same patient (eg, in multiple months) and the same site (eAppendix 5 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)). The marginal predicted probability of each outcome during usual care and SPARC intervention periods was estimated by applying marginal standardization[40](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r40) to average over the observed covariate distribution and the estimated random effects.[41](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r41) Monthly outcome rates are reported as percentages or values per 10 000 patients. A 2-sided significance threshold of _P_< .05 was used. Statistical analyses were conducted in R statistical software, version 3.5.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing). Data were analyzed from August 2018 to March 2021.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Statistical Power \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nEstimated power, with 19 sites across 7 study waves staggered at 4-month intervals, was 80% to detect an absolute increase in brief intervention rates of 7.1 per 10 000 patients seen and an increase in treatment engagement of 2.6 per 10 000 patients seen ([Supplement 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#note-IOI220090-1)).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Results \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nDuring the study period, 333 596 patients (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 193 583 female [58%]; 234 764 White individuals [70%]) made 1 568 917 visits to participating primary care practices ([Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090t1)). Overall, 255 789 and 228 258 patients were seen during usual care and SPARC intervention periods, respectively ([Figure 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090f2)). The majority of patient visits during the SPARC intervention period were during the sustainment phase after active implementation ended (78% of patients-months). Crossover was minimal; among 7456 patients with a visit to a site during the SPARC intervention, 2.2% had a later visit to a different site still in the usual care period.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\nFigure 2.

The SPARC intervention increased brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use\u2014the primary outcome for prevention. The intervention did not increase the proportion of patients who engaged in 3 visits addressing AUD, the primary treatment outcome, but it did increase new AUD diagnoses and AUD treatment initiation\u2014important prespecified intermediate outcomes on the pathway to AUD treatment engagement ([Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090f1)). The SPARC trial is the first implementation trial, to our knowledge, to increase brief intervention, AUD diagnosis, and initiation of AUD treatment in primary care settings without the addition of research-supported clinicians.[42](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r42)-[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r42) However, the absolute magnitudes of increases were relatively small.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nPopulation-based alcohol screening is foundational to alcohol-related prevention and treatment in primary care, and the success of SPARC is notable.[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r47),[48](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r48) Even successful implementation trials in primary care settings have often resulted in low screening rates (eg, less than 10%).[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r49),[50](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r50) Although systematic reviews,[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r49) observational studies,[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r33) and 1 prior trial of implementation strategies[51](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r51) suggest EHR clinical decision support and performance feedback may result in high rates of alcohol screening (51%-93%), this can also result in poor-quality screening[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r35) with nonstandard administration of screens and stigma leading to a low prevalence of positive screens.[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r33),[52](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r52),[53](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r53) To address these challenges,[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) SPARC added practice facilitation to EHR clinical decision support and performance feedback to support standardized integration of screening into workflow, address stigma and gaps in knowledge, and ensure iterative quality improvement by local implementation teams. The SPARC trial also implemented alcohol screening along with other behavioral health screening. This practical,[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r33),[54](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r54)-[59](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r54) affordable[27](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r27) approach achieved high screening rates (83.2%), as well as expected prevalence of positive screens (18.0%), indicating sustained high-quality screening.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nImplementation of brief intervention has been even more challenging than screening, despite its recognized efficacy.[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r1),[60](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r60) The SPARC trial significantly increased brief interventions, but the proportion of primary care patients with documented brief intervention was still relatively low (0.57%). However, this was comparable to the study group in the ADVISe trial that increased brief intervention (0.63%), the only other US randomized clinical implementation trial of brief intervention in a broad, naturalistic primary care population, to our knowledge.[51](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r51) Importantly, ADVISe\u2019s population-based brief intervention rate reflects a low screening rate (9.2% of 218 667 patients) combined with a higher rate of brief intervention among patients with positive alcohol screens (44%), whereas SPARC had a high screening rate (83.2% of 228 258 patients) and a brief intervention rate of 3.2%. The higher brief intervention rate likely reflected EHR prompts and performance feedback for brief intervention in ADVISe combined with 6.5 hours of alcohol-focused training for primary care practitioners,[51](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r51) strategies supported by prior research.[60](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r60)-[66](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r60) The SPARC trial did not have EHR prompts facilitating documentation or performance feedback of brief intervention due to concerns that practitioners might focus on documentation, not counseling.[67](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r67) The SPARC trial also had limited primary care practitioner training time. The EHR prompts, performance feedback, and added training in brief intervention will likely be critical as health systems seek to meet new national performance measures for brief intervention.[39](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r39),[68](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r68)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe SPARC trial significantly increased newly documented AUD diagnoses and treatment initiation. This is important because of the low rates of treatment of AUD in the US.[19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r19) While care managers can increase AUD treatment,[42](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r42)-[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r42) no prior randomized clinical trial, to our knowledge, has tested a primary care implementation intervention designed to increase AUD treatment without adding specialized staff. Further, SPARC took a novel approach. Often, experts recommend second alcohol screens for AUD after an initial brief screen indicates unhealthy alcohol use[69](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r69),[70](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r70) followed by referral.[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r11) However, many patients do not accept referral,[45](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r45),[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r46) and this approach has not been shown to increase AUD treatment.[71](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r71)-[73](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r71) Systematic assessment, diagnosis, and initiation of treatment in primary care may be more effective. Therefore, in SPARC, when patients reported high-risk drinking, the EHR prompted medical assistants to administer an Alcohol Symptom Checklist.[25](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r25),[29](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r29),[30](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r30) Patient responses on the Alcohol Symptom Checklist provided clinicians with timely information on the presence and severity of 11 _DSM-5_ AUD symptoms to aid engagement (for example, \u201cyou indicated you tried to cut down but been unable, can you tell me about that?\u201d)[25](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r25) and patient-centered shared decision-making.[31](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r31) Social workers trained in shared decision-making for AUD also supported primary care and provided proactive outreach to patients with new AUD.[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) Increases in AUD diagnosis and treatment initiation in SPARC suggest this is a promising approach.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nDespite these achievements, increases in AUD diagnosis and treatment initiation were small, and SPARC did not improve treatment engagement. Several elements likely contributed. First, as with brief intervention, many practitioners likely need targeted training to comfortably discuss and manage AUD.[51](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r51),[74](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r74),[75](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r75) In SPARC, primary care practitioners were only available for 2 hours of training that covered all of behavioral health integration. Second, while the EHR prompted practitioners to initiate treatment when making new AUD diagnoses, there were no prompts to schedule subsequent AUD treatment engagement. Third, at the time of the trial, NCQA measures for AUD[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r15) were not a major focus of primary care quality improvement in the study\u2019s health system. Finally, it is likely easier to initiate a single follow-up visit than engage patients in ongoing AUD treatment, especially if patients are hesitant about treatment or have other barriers or competing demands.[76](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r76)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nTaken as a whole, the SPARC trial showed that EHR prompts and performance feedback for alcohol screening, assessment, and AUD treatment initiation, combined with practice facilitation that addressed stigma and knowledge gaps while guiding local teams in weekly PDCA cycle meetings, markedly and sustainably increased screening and assessment, a critical first step toward improving alcohol-related care.[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r47),[48](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r48) However, relatively small gains in brief intervention and treatment initiation were achieved, and no increase in treatment engagement was demonstrated. Further improvements will likely require additional EHR support[77](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r77) and iterative quality improvement processes focused specifically on brief intervention and AUD treatment engagement.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Limitations \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThe SPARC trial had several limitations. Measures relied on EHR documentation and insurance claims. Patient self-report measures are likely more valid than EHR measures,[67](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r67),[78](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r78) and EHR measures and claims likely missed undocumented brief intervention as well as AUD treatment (eg, if patients self-paid or used employee assistance programs). The SPARC trial only measured processes of care; the effect on patient outcomes is unknown. In addition, stepped-wedge trials can be confounded by temporal changes.[79](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r79),[80](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r80) Practice facilitators in SPARC had alcohol-related expertise,[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) and SPARC was conducted in a single regional integrated health plan and delivery system with a shared EHR and a predominantly White insured population. These and other factors potentially limited SPARC\u2019s generalizability. At the same time, SPARC had important strengths. The trial was designed to avoid identification bias[81](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r81),[82](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r82) and also used efficient, affordable[27](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r27) evidence-based implementation strategies[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r20),[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#ioi220090r21) in a health system with no integrated behavioral health care and limited primary care support for alcohol-related care at trial start.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n Conclusions \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\nThis stepped-wedge cluster randomized implementation trial succeeded in increasing several important elements of evidence-based alcohol-related preventive care\u2014systematic screening and brief intervention\u2014as well as increasing assessment of _DSM-5_ symptoms of AUD, new AUD diagnoses, and treatment initiation. However, the magnitude of increases in brief intervention and AUD treatment initiation were modest, and AUD treatment engagement was not increased. Given the extent of the gaps in the quality of alcohol-related care, iterative quality improvement efforts will likely be needed.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752)\n\n[Back to top](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2801752#top)\n\n Article Information \n\n**Accepted for Publication:** December 24, 2022.\n\n**Published Online:** February 27, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.7083\n\n**Corresponding Author:** Amy K.

This population traditionally has not had much attention within the palliative care community.\n\n***Discussion:*** This article provides an evidence-based review of palliative care issues that patients with ESLD and those awaiting liver transplant face, including approaches to prognosis, symptom management, advance care planning, and end-of-life care.\n\n***Conclusion:*** Tremendous opportunity exists to integrate palliative medicine into the care of these patients.\n\n## Introduction\n\nEnd-stage liver disease (ESLD) is a term synonymous with advanced liver disease, liver failure, and decompensated cirrhosis. It is a progressive illness that develops after inflammatory changes in the liver lead to fibrosis and disruption of liver structure and function. The only existing cure is liver transplantation, an option that only a minority of patients will receive. Remaining therapies are palliative in nature. ESLD is a terminal diagnosis, one that may cause symptoms such as pain, fatigue, abdominal pain secondary to ascites, and confusion. Quality of life (QOL) is often negatively impacted by such physical symptoms, as well as by the psychological complications of the illness. In accordance with the relatively poor prognosis, symptom burden, and prevalent mental health issues that ESLD patients face, this group would greatly benefit from improved collaboration between palliative care clinicians, hepatologists, and transplant surgeons. To date, ESLD has received relatively little attention within the palliative care community.\n\nMeanwhile, ESLD is becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States; an estimated 5.5 million people, 2% of the population, are affected. Annually it results in over 2 million clinic visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 40,000 deaths.[1\u20133](#B1) These statistics, culled from *International Classification of Disease, 9th edition* (*ICD-9*) codes, likely underestimate the true burden of disease. The most common causes of ESLD in the United States are alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C. Obesity is associated with a spectrum of liver disease from hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) to more serious liver damage known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; both may lead to cirrhosis and ESLD. This problem is on the rise and expected to become the primary reason for liver transplant between 2015 and 2030.[4](#B4) Liver transplantation leads to a significant survival advantage but is attainable for a minority of patients. Of the 16,000 patients on the waiting list, 6500 are transplanted annually[5](#B5) while 1600 patients will die yearly awaiting transplant. Many more are removed from the waiting list as they become too ill for transplantation.\n\nThis article summarizes the available evidence-based literature regarding palliative care and ESLD. A MEDLINE database search was conducted with the subject headings \u201cend-stage liver disease,\u201d \u201ccirrhosis,\u201d or \u201cliver transplantation,\u201d and \u201cpalliative care,\u201d \u201cprognosis,\u201d \u201csymptom management,\u201d or \u201csupportive care.\u201d Additional studies were located by manual search using references from retrieved articles.\n\n## Patient Experience of ESLD\n\nPatients with ESLD may present in a variety of ways. Commonly, an asymptomatic phase of compensated cirrhosis progresses to portal hypertension followed by decompensation to ESLD. Complications of portal hypertension include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, esophageal and gastric varices, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and coagulopathy. Symptoms often include fatigue, abdominal bloating and pain, spontaneous bruising, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion.\n\n### Symptom experience and QOL\n\nThere are few studies examining the perspective of patients living with ESLD and those undergoing liver transplantation. A Korean questionnaire-based study of 129 cirrhotic patients identified fatigue, abdominal distention, peripheral edema, and muscle cramps as the symptoms most often needing management.[6](#B6) One hundred eighty-eight Australian patients with chronic hepatitis C were surveyed and 83% reported 6 or more symptoms in the past 3 months, with physical and mental fatigue, irritability, depression, and abdominal pain being the most frequently reported.[7](#B7) The SUPPORT Study reported that 60% of ESLD patients identified experienced pain.[8](#B8) This was rated at least moderately severe most of the time in 1 of 3 patients.[9](#B9) There is often a discrepancy between patient-reported symptom burden and physician awareness of such symptoms, for example, muscle cramps, which occurred in 52% of 92 cirrhotic patients in a 1996 survey, are not often identified as an issue by physicians.[10](#B10)\n\nMultiple questionnaire-based studies have shown a decrease in all aspects of QOL in ESLD patients compared with controls.[11\u201314](#B11) Younger age, muscle cramps, and hepatitis C have each been associated with worse QOL, while disease severity has not been shown to correlate.[12\u201314](#B12) The worse QOL experienced by ESLD patients is comparable to those with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure. Patients awaiting liver transplant have a perceived QOL similar to those awaiting heart transplantation.[15](#B15) In a study of 67 French patients assessed before and after transplant, patients reported fewer disease related symptoms and a lower overall level of distress afterwards. QOL after transplantation approached but did not equal that of the general population.[16](#B16)\n\n### Psychiatric factors\n\nPsychiatric comorbidities are thought to be quite common in patients with ESLD. An Italian survey of 156 patients with cirrhosis found greater than 50% had a Beck Depression Inventory score indicative of a depressed mood.[17](#B17) Those with depression experience more physical symptoms, have worse QOL, and are more likely to die while awaiting transplant. This discrepancy is not explained by illness severity. Similarly to patients with cancer, diagnosing depression may be challenging due to the frequent overlap of somatic symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, and insomnia. Anxiety is also prevalent, with estimates in pretransplant patients ranging from 27%\u201344%. A survey of Brazilian patients found 19% to have moderate\u2013severe levels of anxiety, while 27% of those with autoimmune cirrhosis had severe anxiety.[18](#B18),[19](#B19)\n\n### Prognosis\n\nPatients with compensated cirrhosis have a median survival of 6\u201312 years. Decompensation occurs in 5%\u20137% annually; median survival then declines to 2 years.[20](#B20),[21](#B21) Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores are the most widely used tools for prognostication. CTP uses total bilirubin, albumin, and international normalized ratio (INR) values, as well as the degree of encephalopathy and ascites. Categories A, B, and C indicate increasing severity of liver disease. CTP score was first utilized in prognostication and listing of liver transplant candidates; its use has now been validated in patients with liver disease of varying severity. MELD utilizes INR, bilirubin, and creatinine to predict survival; higher scores reflect more significant liver disease. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) now uses MELD for allocation of liver transplants. [Table 1](#T1) shows rates of 6-, 12-, and 24-month survival in ESLD comparing CTP and MELD scores. Clinical judgment, patient comorbidities, rate of decline, and likelihood of transplantation should also affect prognostication in ESLD.[21](#B21)\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nSurvival of End-Stage Liver Disease Patients Based on Child-Turcotte-Pugh/Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Scores\n\n| *CTP score* | *6 months* | *12 months* | *24 months* | *MELD score* | *6 months* | *12 months* | *24 months* |\n| Class A | n/a | 95% | 90% | 0\u20139 |  |  |  |\n| Class B | n/a | 80% | 70% | 10\u201319 | 92% | 86% | 80% |\n|  |  |  |  | 20\u201329 | 78% | 71% | 66% |\n| Class C | n/a | 45% | 38% | 0\u201339 | 40% | 37% | 33% |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/T1/)\n\nCTP, Child-Turcotte-Pugh; MELD, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease.\n\nPrognosis in ESLD is comparable to patients with other types of organ failure. Those with heart failure have a 50% 5-year survival; class IV heart failure carries 30%\u201340% 1-year mortality.[22](#B22) Ambulatory COPD patients with the lowest lung function scores have 25% 2-year and 55% 4-year mortality.[23](#B23)\n\nAscites is often the earliest complication of ESLD; when present it indicates 50% 2-year mortality. Median survival is 6 months when ascites becomes refractory. Encephalopathy that is severe or refractory has a 12-month average survival. In an analysis of 178 studies, 30% of ESLD patients with infections died within 30 days, another 30% within 1 year.[24](#B24) Renal failure portends the worst outcome; hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) equals a rapid deterioration in kidney function in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Declining liver function is thought to cause changes in renal blood flow and blood vessel tone rather than direct kidney damage. Type 1 HRS is rapidly progressive, with a four-week median survival.[25](#B25) Type 2 HRS is more insidious, with a 6-month life expectancy.[26](#B26) [Figure 1](#f1) outlines median survival according to presence of several common ESLD complications.\n\n## Transplantation\n\nThe experience of waiting for a transplant impacts patients considerably.[13](#B13) Most patients interviewed in qualitative studies experience suffering of a physical and psychological nature. They identify difficulty coping, loss of trust in physicians, and medical, personal, and social uncertainties.[29\u201331](#B29) There is sparse literature on the experience of patients not eligible for transplant. A recent retrospective chart review was performed of 102 patients removed from transplant list or denied listing who were cared for at a single Canadian institution. This study found that while a majority of these patients had symptoms including pain and nausea, only 10% of patients were referred for palliative care consultation, and 28% had documentation of a do-not-resuscitate status (DNR).[32](#B32) This highlights the discrepancy between palliative care needs and utilization. Underserved groups that have not had equal listing for transplant, such as women, minorities, and obese patients with comorbidities, may also represent areas of opportunity for palliative care. Substance abuse is prevalent and transplant programs require abstinence before listing. Patients in methadone maintenance programs are at high risk for relapse after transplant.[33](#B33) Caring for this population with coexisting substance abuse may be challenging and requires close collaboration among clinicians.\n\n## Symptom Management\n\nIntensive symptom management is an integral role for palliative care in many illnesses. Appropriate medication selection and dosing in ESLD is often difficult. A majority of drugs are metabolized in the liver and liver failure may lead to accumulation of medications or toxic metabolites. Decreased hepatic blood flow leads to slower drug metabolism and higher bioavailability. This amounts to a higher risk of adverse effects and often leads to less aggressive symptom management. Clinical trials routinely exclude patients with liver dysfunction, making it difficult to apply results to ESLD patients. A review of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications in 2005 found only 23 medications with recommended dose adjustments for hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh scores.[34](#B34)\n\nESLD patients report similar pain levels as patients with lung and colon cancer.[9](#B9) However, undertreatment of pain is common. No randomized trials or large epidemiologic studies of pain management in ESLD have been conducted, and data is limited to small case series and preclinical data. Physicians may be reluctant to prescribe opioids for those with a history of substance abuse. Opioids may precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy and some sources recommend against using any opioids in patients with a history of encephalopathy. Constipation is a common side effect of opioids and may exacerbate encephalopathy.[35](#B35) Despite these limitations, opioids may be required for management of moderate-to-severe pain particularly at the end of life. When utilized, initiation at low doses and slow uptitration of dosing is generally recommended.\n\nMorphine clearance in cirrhotic patients is delayed by 35%\u201360% in studies utilizing single-dose administration. Administered orally, there is increased bioavailability due to decreased first pass metabolism. Dose reduction and increased dosing intervals are recommended. Morphine should be avoided in patients with concomitant renal dysfunction due to risk of neurotoxicity from accumulation of toxic metabolites. Similarly, oxycodone and hydromorphone have impaired elimination profiles in ESLD. One study of single-dose fentanyl administration in cirrhotic patients did not lead to altered pharmacokinetics. It therefore has been recommended by some to be the opioid of choice in ESLD. Methadone was not shown to have altered kinetics in a study of 14 patients enrolled in methadone maintenance, however, it has not been investigated for use as analgesia in patients with liver impairment.[35\u201337](#B35)\n\nOver-the-counter pain medications are widely used, although guidelines for patients with liver impairment are not available. Short-term use of acetaminophen at a dose of 4\u2009g/d for 13 days showed no adverse effects when given to 20 patients with stable liver disease including 8 with cirrhosis.[38](#B38) For longer term use, experts recommend doses no higher than 2\u20133\u2009g/d.[35](#B35) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorie drugs (NSAIDs) have many adverse effects including increased risk of renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome due to inhibition of prostaglandins. NSAIDs may also increase risk of mucosal bleeding and interfere with the effect of diuretics, and are therefore best avoided.[36](#B36) The controversy over appropriate strategies for pain management in ESLD is an area that palliative care may be able to help reconcile.\n\nAscites is the most common complication of cirrhosis and most common reason for hospitalization in patients with ESLD; management involves sodium restriction and the use of oral diuretics. Dietary sodium restriction to under 2\u2009g/d and a diuretic regimen of spironolactone and furosemide was shown to be effective in more than 90% of patients in reducing ascites to acceptable levels in a randomized study comparing medical therapy to peritoneovenous shunting in 299 patients.[39](#B39) Some patients become refractory to diuretics and require repeated paracenteses or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). Five meta-analyses on available randomized controlled trials including up 305\u2013330 patients concluded that TIPS led to lower rates of ascites recurrence but higher rates of encephalopathy. One meta-analysis demonstrated a trend toward improved survival and a second showed a survival advantage for TIPS.[40](#B40) For patients who do not undergo TIPS, repeated large volume paracenteses are often required. Indwelling peritoneal catheters are sometimes used for patients with malignant ascites, retrospective studies have shown a low median infection rate of 5.9%.[41](#B41) However, such catheters are less often used in ESLD because there is a theoretically increased risk of peritonitis. A retrospective review of 12 ESLD patients undergoing catheter placement for refractory ascites yielded a 16% infection rate.[42](#B42) The technique of continuous peritoneal drainage of ascites was studied in 40 patients with ESLD and refractory ascites. When limited to 72 hours of drainage, there were no cases of infection seen.[43](#B43)\n\nHepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome ranging from subtle personality or sleep disturbances to confusion and coma. Precipitants include gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infections, renal and electrolyte disturbances, constipation, and medications, particularly benzodiazepines. Treatment involves correction of underlying causes and the use of medications aimed at decreasing intestinal toxins, particularly ammonia. Nonabsorbable disaccharides such as lactulose have traditionally been the mainstay of treatment. A Cochrane Review of 10 studies of lactulose versus placebo found that only nonrandomized, controlled trials showed a benefit for lactulose in the acute treatment of HE.[44](#B44) An open-label randomized controlled trial of lactulose versus placebo for secondary prophylaxis in 140 patients with a history of HE showed a decrease in recurrent HE from 46.8% to 19.6%.[45](#B45) Nonabsorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin may also be used for HE. A meta-analysis of 8 studies comparing rifaximin versus nonabsorbable disaccharides showed that rifaximin was at least as efficacious at treating HE, with better results in serum ammonia levels, mental status, asterixis, and improved safety.[46](#B46) However, rifaximin is a more costly option, an important consideration in the care of hospice patients.[47](#B47)\n\n### Advance care planning/social support\n\nWhile data are scarce, goals of care and advance care planning seem to be discussed less frequently with ESLD patients compared with cancer patients. In SUPPORT, 66% of ESLD patients preferred cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when asked about resuscitation status.[9](#B9),[48](#B48) In a separate study conducted at three teaching hospitals, 16% of ESLD patients had DNR orders compared with 47% of patients with metastatic lung cancer. Housestaff were less likely to discuss these issues with ESLD patients despite awareness of their poor prognosis.[49](#B49) There is an inherent difficulty in discussing advance directives with patients pursuing curative therapies and DNR orders are often considered controversial for patients awaiting transplantation. Bramstedt,[50](#B50) a transplant ethicist, argues that in certain patients with ESLD, resuscitation may be futile and not in a seriously ill patient's best interest. It is imperative to discuss goals of care and identify health care proxy agents promptly, as encephalopathy can impact decision making.\n\nCaregiver support is crucial for transplant candidates and lack of a reliable caregiver may preclude transplant. Qualitative studies reveal that caregiver burden is high, with a significant percentage of both pretransplant and posttransplant patient caregivers reporting decreased QOL, low life satisfaction, and a high amount of caregiving strain.[51](#B51) Women caregivers in particular report higher perceived overload and higher levels of depression than men.[52](#B52) In a survey of 61 caregivers, there were higher rates of depression and overall burden scores when caring for patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with other etiologies.[53](#B53)\n\n## Opportunities for Collaboration between Palliative Care and Liver Transplant Teams\n\nBest practices for the role of palliative care in ESLD patients and transplant candidates have not been defined. The fourth edition of the *Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine* contains only three references to liver transplantation and one paragraph on palliative care in liver disease.[54](#B54) The Gold Standards Framework in the UK, a guideline for care of patients with end-stage illnesses including cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and neurologic diseases, omits liver disease.[55](#B55) In a survey of U.K. gastroenterologists, most had access to palliative care, but less than half referred a patient within the previous 3 months. The most common reasons for referral were end-of-life care and symptom management.[56](#B56) Similarly, lung transplant clinicians favor the idea of integrating palliative care after transplantation but few make referrals.[57](#B57) Palliative care interest in the liver disease population does seem to be increasing. The recently published book, *Evidence-Based Practice of Palliative Medicine,* contains two chapters on liver disease detailing clinical course, symptomatology and treatment considerations.[58](#B58),[59](#B59)\n\n### Upstream integration of palliative care into hepatology and transplant care\n\nIntroduction of palliative care for patients with ESLD and those awaiting transplant can be challenging. Many patients feel well for years after diagnosis and develop symptoms of ESLD abruptly. This allows less time to acquire coping skills needed to face progressive illness and approach the end of life. End-of-life discussions can be difficult as patients often focus their hope on obtaining a life-saving transplant.[60](#B60) Many surgical specialists, like other clinicians, may think of palliative care as synonymous with end-of-life care. In 2005, the American College of Surgeons released a statement extending the palliative care needs of surgical patients to include those at all stages of disease.[61](#B61) There has been increased support in the transplant community for integration of palliative care as evidenced by this statement in *Surgical Clinics of North America:* \u201cThe fields of transplantation and palliative care have a treasure trove of experience that is lacking in the other that could be exchanged profitably with a great sense of satisfaction for all.\u201d[62](#B62) Such a statement suggests an opening in the transplant community to start a dialogue with palliative care specialists.\n\nCurrently, palliative and hospice care are offered to patients rarely after removal from the transplant list. This event is often associated with withdrawal of specialty care, feelings of abandonment in patients, and death within a few days, without a chance for end-of-life care to be optimized.[63](#B63) A strategy of providing palliative care alongside disease-directed therapy while awaiting transplant has the potential to improve QOL, patient satisfaction and reduce hospital admissions without decreasing chances of transplantation.\n\nPalliative care involvement after transplantation is another topic gaining interest. A recent pilot study assessed early palliative care intervention for patients after liver transplant that required admission to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). This intervention involved 104 patients and 31 deaths. Goals of care discussions and DNR rates increased, and SICU lengths of stay decreased. There was improved communication and family satisfaction as well as earlier consensus around goals of care without impacting patient mortality.[64](#B64)\n\nThere are several barriers that may need to be addressed for this integration to be successful. There may be a misunderstanding that palliative care is end-of-life care and education of transplant clinicians is essential. Education of trainees in related fields would also likely increase the involvement of palliative care in the management of ESLD patients.[65](#B65),[66](#B66) Consideration could be given to development of clinical triggers for palliative care consultation such as development of refractory ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or HE that each portend a poor prognosis. Use of certain clinical factors to trigger palliative care consultation has been investigated in many disease groups such as in heart failure, and has been shown in the ICU setting to lead to improved outcomes as noted previously.[66](#B66),[67](#B67)\n\n### Hospice care\n\nFew patients with end-stage organ failure are discharged from the hospital with hospice.[68](#B68) In 2003, ESLD was the fifth ranking noncancer diagnosis for hospice enrollment, representing 1.6% of patients.[69](#B69) Possible reasons for underutilization of hospice include the belief that transplantation and hospice are mutually exclusive, and the lack of referral guidelines. Patients with ESLD are referred late, with an average survival of 29 days compared with overall mean length of hospice stay of 59 days. Late hospice referral puts patients at risk for decreased quality of care at the end of life.[70](#B70) Unfortunately, using National Hospice Organization guidelines to identify hospice-eligible ESLD patients did not accurately identify patients who died within 6 months.[68](#B68) MELD has been used to estimate 30-day mortality in a cohort of 50 ELSD patients discharged to hospice with moderate correlation between MELD and survival.[71](#B71) MELD may therefore be used to estimate 6 month mortality, and hospice eligibility as well. This has not yet been accomplished in practice.\n\nHospice eligibility for patients on the transplant list remains controversial. Those in support of this approach cite the inability to know which patients will ultimately receive a transplant, that patients at the top of the list have the greatest need for monitoring and preparation for end of life, and that hospice services can provide support to patients and families and improve QOL. Others feel that patients awaiting transplant should not benefit from hospice care since they are pursuing curative therapies, hospice services may not cover expensive treatments these patients often need, and according to Health Care Financing Administration guidelines, more than 80% of care days provided by hospice must be in the home.[72](#B72) If patients on the waiting list are to be enrolled on hospice, hospice teams would need to recognize that patients are likely to remain full code and may require hospitalizations for acute decompensation.\n\nA recent retrospective review demonstrates an example of successful comanagement of patients awaiting transplant. In 2000, hepatology and hospice services at UC Davis jointly introduced the concept of comanaging patients. One hundred fifty-seven patients with ESLD were admitted to hospice under this innovative program; of these patients, 122 died. Patients had a mean length of stay of 38 days. Six patients on hospice went on to successful liver transplant, and 4 of these had improvements in MELD scores during this time. The hospice staff was successfully trained to manage complicated symptoms at home.[73](#B73),[74](#B74) In this group, average MELD score at time of hospice admission was 21 and almost all patients with MELD over 18 died within several months. This study highlights that only 5% of the listed patients in this program actually went on to transplant.\n\n### Areas for further research\n\nPalliative care clinicians should aim to assist in better defining the needs and expectations of ESLD patients and assist in development of appropriate symptom management strategies.[73](#B73) Identification of potential triggers for palliative care consultations and hospice referrals is another opportunity to improve care of these patients. Finally, even when patients do make it to transplantation, many are left with a new set of chronic issues and will face mortality once again. Early involvement of palliative care in the management of patients pretransplant would thus provide continuity posttransplantation and may lead to improved outcomes for patients and families. Early integration of palliative care may also lead to improvement in symptoms and QOL, and potentially improve a patient's chance at transplantation.\n\n## Summary\n\nPatients with ESLD have significant palliative care needs in regards to physical symptoms and psychosocial aspects of care. These needs are often unrecognized among caregivers and subsequently unmet. High-quality data addressing many palliative care treatment aspects in ESLD are lacking. This patient population represents a unique opportunity for further research, education, and collaboration between palliative care clinicians and transplant providers. Integration of care between these groups will hopefully lead to significant benefit among patients, caregivers, and transplant teams.\n\n## Author Disclosure Statement\n\nNo competing financial interests exist.\n\n## References\n\n* 1.Shaheen NJ, Hansen RA: The burden of gastrointestinal and liver disease, 2006.

The oral cavity and its surrounding structures are essential parts of the human body, integral to its daily functioning and contributing substantially to the overall well-being of individuals. The oral cavity also is the main conduit of human interaction with society. Humans use it to verbally communicate with others, to take in nutrients and participate in communal eating, and to convey emotion. The appearance of an individual\u2019s teeth and surrounding structures greatly influences how others perceive them and how they perceive themselves. This perception has an impact on an individual\u2019s ability to work, contributes to one\u2019s social status, and can affect a person\u2019s socioeconomic position in society.\n\nAlthough there is much to celebrate about ongoing improvements in oral health, many people still suffer from chronic oral conditions and lack of access to the dental care they need. Moreover, the incidence of oral diseases, like many chronic disease conditions, is socially patterned, with the largest burden of disease occurring among children living in poverty, racial and ethnic minorities, frail elderly, and other socially marginalized groups, such as immigrant populations. Marginalized groups include groups defined by race, religion, age, financial status, politics, and culture ([Given 2008](#ch2.ref181); [Li et al. 2018](#ch2.ref301); [Hung et al. 2019](#ch2.ref231)). Others not defined by sociodemographic characteristics, but who have special health care needs (SHCNs), also can be marginalized. Not only do these groups suffer the highest burden of oral disease, they also face the greatest barriers to accessing routine preventive and other dental services ([Parish et al. 2015](#ch2.ref393); [Velez et al. 2017](#ch2.ref536); [Lebrun-Harris 2021](#ch2.ref291)). The major barriers to accessing dental treatment include high cost, lack of accessible dental services in the community, geographic isolation, fear and anxiety, and other social and economic factors ([National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services 2004](#ch2.ref363); [Nasseh and Vujicic 2014](#ch2.ref356); [Davis and Reisine 2015](#ch2.ref128); [Vujicic et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref541); [Gupta et al. 2019](#ch2.ref199)).\n\nBeyond individual benefits, maintaining good oral health brings social and economic benefits to families and communities. As [Listl and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref256) note, the effects of oral diseases are significant in economic terms. There are direct, indirect, and intangible costs, such as treatment expenditures, missed days from school and work, and lessening of the quality of life ([Listl et al. 2015](#ch2.ref306)). In 2015, dental diseases around the world (with the exclusion of oral and pharyngeal cancers) accounted for approximately $545 billion (USD) in total costs, which included $357 billion in direct costs and $188 billion in indirect costs ([Righolt et al. 2018](#ch2.ref420)). In high-income countries, such as the United States, significant numbers of days are lost every year from school, work, and daily activities, with productivity losses being similar to those associated with musculoskeletal injuries and disorders ([Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health 2012](#ch2.ref39); [Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o and Wehby 2012a](#ch2.ref197); [Hayes et al. 2013](#ch2.ref207); [Singhal et al. 2013](#ch2.ref470)). The academic performance of children, employment in adults, and productivity in the workplace are also affected ([Mobius and Rosenblat 2006](#ch2.ref349); [Seirawan et al. 2012](#ch2.ref455); [B\u00f3o et al. 2013](#ch2.ref58); [Singhal et al. 2013](#ch2.ref470)). In fact, securing employment and what one can earn is influenced by the appearance of the mouth and teeth ([Hamermesh and Biddle 1994](#ch2.ref205); [Glied and Neidell 2010](#ch2.ref186); [B\u00f3o et al. 2013](#ch2.ref58)). Oral diseases worsen the impacts of other diseases, too, such as diabetes. Importantly, research demonstrates that periodontal treatment can reduce total and diabetes-related health care costs ([Nasseh et al. 2017](#ch2.ref360)). The out-of-pocket costs that dental care can impose are also of concern, as they can put economically insecure families at risk of poverty ([Bernab\u00e9 et al. 2017](#ch2.ref52)). Finally, poor access to dental care also affects the health care system, resulting in inappropriate use of physician offices and hospital emergency departments ([Allareddy et al. 2014](#ch2.ref12); [Vujicic and Nasseh 2014](#ch2.ref542); [Singh et al. 2019](#ch2.ref467)). As can be seen from the above, the economic benefits of improved oral health and access to dental care are substantial.\n\nThere are three broad-ranging factors that contribute to oral health and oral disease as they manifest at the community or population level. The first theme explores the important concept that oral health is integral to overall health and should be embedded in the broad framework of the whole body\u2019s health ([Peres et al. 2019](#ch2.ref398)).\n\nIt has been more than 25 years since Surgeon General C. Everett Koop ([Koop 1993](#ch2.ref280)) brought this notion to national attention when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not healthy without good oral health.\u201d Having good oral health means, at a minimum, that an individual is free of oral infection and pain and has acceptable oral function and facial aesthetics. The FDI (French: F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Dentaire Internationale) World Dental Federation General Assembly recently updated its definition of oral health ([Box 1](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box1/?report=objectonly)) to emphasize that oral health must be thought of broadly and that it has numerous implications for an individual\u2019s physiological, social, and psychological well-being ([Figure 1](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig1/?report=objectonly)) (FDI World Dental Federation).\n\n#### [Figure 1](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig1/?report=objectonly)\n\nCore elements of oral health.\n\nThe second theme emphasizes that the benefits of good oral health extend beyond the individual to families and communities. When considering oral health from a population perspective, it becomes clear that the burden of oral disease falls most heavily on the most vulnerable groups in U.S. society. Oral diseases disproportionately affect population subgroups that have limited economic resources, low levels of educational attainment, poor access to dental care, and lower levels of social influence or political capital. This leads to recognizable oral health disparities and inequities.\n\nIdentifying the factors that contribute to poor oral health among vulnerable groups can provide guidance for developing and targeting oral health promotion strategies and reducing inequities. To that end, models of oral disease development have been created that bring attention to the multilevel factors now known to contribute to oral health status. Peres and colleagues\u2019 recent model ([Figure 2](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig2/?report=objectonly)) ([Peres et al. 2019](#ch2.ref398); [World Health Organization 2020](#ch2.ref571)) shows that the determinants of oral health arise from the level of the individual, the family, the community, and the nation. Factors known to influence oral health status are classified into three levels, labeled as the structural, intermediate, and proximal determinants of oral health. Proximal determinants are related to an individual\u2019s biology and behavior, and the relationship of these determinants to health status often is readily apparent. For example, an individual\u2019s choices around diet, tobacco use, and oral hygiene all have clear links to oral health.\n\n#### [Figure 2](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig2/?report=objectonly)\n\nSocial and commercial determinants of oral health (Peres model). Note: *NCD* = noncommunicable diseases.\n\n### Box 1FDI World Dental Federation definition of oral health\n\nOral health is multifaceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow, and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort, and disease of the craniofacial complex. Further attributes of oral health:\n\n* It is a fundamental component of health and physical and mental well-being. It exists along a continuum influenced by the values and attitudes of people and communities.\n* It reflects the physiological, social, and psychological attributes that are essential to the quality of life.\n* It is influenced by the person\u2019s changing experiences, perceptions, expectations, and ability to adapt to circumstances.\n\nSource: [FDI World Dental Federation, 2016](#ch2.ref185).\n\nThe broader environmental context in which individuals live comprises both structural and intermediate determinants. Determinants at these levels generally are not under an individual\u2019s direct control and their linkage to oral health can seem less clear. Nevertheless, determinants at these levels are well understood to play an important role in influencing health status. Collectively, these structural and intermediate determinants are referred to as the social determinants of health (SDoH).\n\nThe [World Health Organization (WHO) (2020)](#ch2.ref571) defines SDoH as:\n\n> [T]he conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities\u2014the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between [social groups].\n\nThis definition is now commonly expanded to include the commercial determinants of health when they have contributed in important ways to health status. The commercial determinants of health are defined as the \u201cstrategies and approaches used by the private sector to promote products and choices that are detrimental to health\u201d ([Kickbusch et al. 2016](#ch2.ref271) p. e895). Most notably, such products include cavity-promoting foods and beverages or substances such as tobacco products that are known to cause or promote oral disease. However, not all commercial determinants should be framed as negative, because commercial activity also results in continuously improving products for maintaining good oral health and can improve health education messages provided to the public about good oral hygiene habits.\n\nThe third broad-ranging theme involves the substantial ways in which dental care financing and delivery limit access to care and perpetuate disparities in oral health. The reasons that access to needed dental care remains challenging for many are complex, but they certainly are related to the historical separation of dentistry from overall health care, rendering dentistry one of the most siloed of the health professions. This partitioning of the dental profession is reflected in the educational model, in dental care financing (both public and private), and in how and where dental care services are provided. This contributes to an arbitrary disconnection between medicine and dentistry and results in dental care being viewed by some policymakers as a nonessential health service. This policy neglect is evident in the fragmented approach to dental care financing at both the federal and state levels. Public payment for dental care through Medicaid varies across states, with many offering only limited benefits, and in four states, no benefits at all for adults. Medicare, the main provider of medical insurance for older adults, contains no dental coverage. The scope of practice for some dental professionals, including, hygienists and dental therapists, also varies across states, and greater restrictions can contribute to the challenges of providing preventive dental services to reach vulnerable populations (including the institutionalized elderly, homeless people, and the rural poor).\n\nWhen viewed from a population level, dental care financing and care delivery seem wholly insufficient to meet the needs of a diverse population. This existing system is not fulfilling its purpose ([Vujicic 2018](#ch2.ref540)). Policy reform is urgently needed to resolve these structural barriers, to address social determinants that limit access to effective prevention, and to guarantee access to appropriate care for all. The benefits of these reforms can be demonstrated to fully justify the costs ([Vujicic 2018](#ch2.ref540)).\n\n### Social Determinants of Health\n\nSDoH have been a focus of public health for decades. [Sydenstricker (1935)](#ch2.ref492) said that true improvements in population health required \u201ccontrol, so far as means are known to science, of all of the environmental factors that affect physical and mental well-being.\u201d That, he explained, includes economic security, healthy housing, availability of nutrient-dense food, opportunities for exercise, and efforts to provide social security for all. [Link and Phelan (1995)](#ch2.ref303) described social factors such as low socioeconomic status and lack of social support (and arguably industry and market forces) as fundamental causes of disease. They base this assertion on evidence that the effect of SDoH persists even when intervening mechanisms such as individual health behaviors change.\n\n[Adler and colleagues (2016)](#ch2.ref5) noted that the best available evidence suggests using public funds to invest in addressing SDoH to achieve better population health, less inequality, and lower overall health care costs. Moreover, social determinants are not restricted to those issues that have proximate links to health, such as tobacco policy, which means public health policies can be viewed more broadly to include those related to education, labor, criminal justice, transportation, and social welfare, given their potential contributions to population health. Patterns of health-promoting or health-damaging behavior emerge early as one develops physiologically and socially, and then continue to be shaped by positive and negative life circumstances. Oral health disparities, therefore, are attributable in part to public priorities and spending decisions. For example, insurance coverage and the amount of public spending on social programs in a nation influence both oral health and quality of life. Nations that spend more on social programs have populations with better oral health status ([Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o et al. 2013](#ch2.ref196)). Similarly, the coverage and amount of social spending in a nation, particularly a welfare state, can influence the magnitude of income-related disparities in oral health or differences in oral health among income groups, but more research is needed to clarify different types of spending approaches ([Sanders et al. 2009](#ch2.ref441)).\n\nThese effects extend to dental care utilization, as well. In nations with more public insurance coverage, differences among the numbers of dental visits reported by population groups are smaller ([Pal\u00e8ncia et al. 2013](#ch2.ref391)). Further, this effect on dental care extends throughout the life course ([Listl 2011](#ch2.ref304); [2012](#ch2.ref305)). Because the U.S. public investment in dental insurance and direct provision of services is a mixture of programs that operate at the federal, state, and local levels, inevitable gaps are created in insurance coverage, in turn contributing to the development of oral health disparities and inequities.\n\nOral diseases are not equitably distributed within society as a result of the contributions to oral health status that arise from the social and economic environment. Viewed from a population perspective, it can readily be seen that the burden of many oral diseases disproportionately affects marginalized subgroups, giving rise to oral health inequities. However, when these disparities are the result of differences in the availability of social and economic health-promoting resources\u2014including access to affordable healthy foods, professional dental prevention and treatment services, and dental insurance\u2014they are considered avoidable, unnecessary, and amenable to policy action. As such, these disparities are viewed as unjust and are correctly described as inequities ([Whitehead 1991](#ch2.ref560); [Braveman 2003](#ch2.ref63)). [Leenan (1985)](#ch2.ref296) defined equity in health care using the following basic conditions:\n\n* Equal access to available care for equal need;\n* Equal utilization for equal need, and\n* Equal quality of care for all.\n\nEven at the local level of a neighborhood or built environment, the same effect is seen; namely, that the social, political, and economic characteristics of small residential areas are associated with oral health\u2014independent of the characteristics of the individuals who live there. For example, among Black families with incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level, the quality of housing and available social supports appear to ameliorate the effect of poverty ([Sanders et al. 2008b](#ch2.ref440)). Specifically, when low-income adults and children resided in better quality housing and had social supports, they were more likely to retain 20 or more teeth and have less tooth decay ([Sanders et al. 2008a](#ch2.ref445); [Sanders et al. 2008b](#ch2.ref440)). This suggests that, in addition to the importance of addressing poverty, improving the built and social environments can result in resilience as a response to the harmful health effects of poverty itself.\n\nThe federal Healthy People 2020 initiative addressed SDoH as one of its four overarching goals for the decade, and this was reaffirmed and expanded in the launch of Healthy People 2030 in August 2020 ([Hubbard et al. 2020](#ch2.ref230); [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2020a](#ch2.ref518)). This emphasis on SDoH also has been shared by other U.S. health initiatives, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011](#ch2.ref514)) and the National Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy ([National Prevention Council 2011](#ch2.ref371)). Healthy People 2030 is focusing on the following five key determinants: economic stability, education access and quality, social and community context, health care access and quality, and the neighborhood and built environment ([Figure 3](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig3/?report=objectonly)). These determinants are addressed by interventions related to food insecurity, housing instability, early childhood education, literacy, civic participation, social cohesion, access to primary care, and environmental conditions.\n\n#### [Figure 3](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig3/?report=objectonly)\n\nSocial determinants of health.\n\nWhen structured in favorable ways, all five determinants contribute to better oral health and facilitate favorable oral health trajectories during the life course ([Gomaa et al. 2019](#ch2.ref187)). The new FDI definition of oral health ([Box 1](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box1/?report=objectonly)) and the Peres model ([Peres et al. 2019](#ch2.ref398)) ([Figure 2](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig2/?report=objectonly)) reflect the importance of these factors in determining oral health status.\n\nAs part of the commitment by HHS to support improved health and well-being of the population, the Healthy People 2030 initiative sets 10-year measurable goals and objectives for the nation related to health promotion and disease prevention. Several of these objectives have an important role in oral health, such as reducing untreated dental disease, increasing water fluoridation, expanding access to dental insurance and improving access to care; improving population health through efforts to reduce added sugar consumption; and enhancing the dental public health infrastructure. It is noteworthy that Healthy People 2030 places strong emphasis on the importance of SDoH ([Figure 3](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig3/?report=objectonly)); all the social determinants listed in the figure are directly related to oral health. Focusing attention on their importance can foster both policy and research that leads to improved oral health for all.\n\nHealth professional education, including dentistry, also has identified SDoH as an important component of the curriculum of future professionals ([National Academies of Sciences 2016](#ch2.ref362); [Sabato et al. 2018](#ch2.ref434); [Tiwari and Palatta 2019](#ch2.ref498)). In clinical dentistry as well, there is growing emphasis on understanding and incorporating SDoH as part of patient-centered care ([L\u00e9vesque et al. 2016](#ch2.ref298); [da Fonseca and Avenetti 2017](#ch2.ref124); [Northridge et al. 2017](#ch2.ref380); [Edelstein 2018](#ch2.ref146); [Chi and Scott 2019](#ch2.ref98)).\n\n### Commercial Determinants of Health\n\nIn addition to the conventional SDoH, the Peres model ([Peres et al. 2019](#ch2.ref398)) emphasizes the broad influence that commercial determinants and corporate strategies exert across all other factors. This concept has its roots in the decades-long battles fought by the U.S. federal and state governments against the tobacco industry, but in recent decades it also has matured into an understanding of the pervasive effects on health generated by a broad segment of commodity industries. As important influencers of consumption and the cultural and societal norms around activities such as behavior and diet, markets and industry play a key role in determining the health of individuals and populations and can drive associated disparities ([Kearns et al. 2015](#ch2.ref266); [Friel and Jamieson 2019](#ch2.ref171); [Kearns and Bero 2019](#ch2.ref265); [Kearns and Watt 2019](#ch2.ref267); [Watt et al. 2019](#ch2.ref555)).\n\nThere is increasing recognition that rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer, are influenced by corporate strategies. Specifically, marketing, pricing, and subsidization of unhealthy products influence and drive consumption patterns of sugar and other sweeteners, tobacco, alcohol, and other unhealthy foods and beverages, giving rise to the concept of \u201cindustrial epidemics,\u201d a term emphasizing that a higher incidence of NCD is driven in part by the producers and marketers of commodities that are harmful to individual and societal health ([Jahiel and Babor 2007](#ch2.ref252); [Collin and Hill 2015](#ch2.ref107)).\n\nCommercial determinants shape consumer preferences, affect physical and social environments, and influence public policy development ([Collin and Hill 2015](#ch2.ref107)). When addressing the Global Conference on Health Promotion in June 2013, WHO Director General Margaret Chan described the need to counter corporate threats to health policy beyond those of tobacco, citing the need to contend with \u201cBig Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol,\u201d and arguing that the formulation of public policy for health must be protected from vigorous opposition and distortion by commercial or vested interests ([Chan 2013](#ch2.ref90)). The WHO FCTC (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control), adopted in 2003, provided the first treaty that legally binds the 181 ratifying countries to measures to ensure health through control of tobacco and could provide a model for future treaties focused on other health threats. One organization addressing the problem identified by Director General Chan is the World Economic Forum (WEF). WEF aims to be a platform upon which business, government, international organizations, civil society, and academia can interact to achieve a global impact. Through organizations such as this, corporate threats to health policy can be addressed via stakeholder engagement and cooperation aimed at developing a shared vision ([World Economic Forum 2020](#ch2.ref566)).\n\n#### The Tobacco Industry\n\nThe significant role of commercial efforts to influence personal choices that lead to health consequences should not be underestimated. For example, it is known that low-income high school students are disproportionally exposed to tobacco advertising and fast food availability near their schools ([D\u2019Angelo et al. 2016](#ch2.ref123)). Tobacco companies spent US$8.2 billion on advertising in 2019, marketing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in the United States ([Federal Trade Commission 2021a](#ch2.ref157); [2021b](#ch2.ref158)). This amount translates to about $22.5 million each day, or nearly $1 million every hour. Tobacco advertising commonly targets low-income individuals, particularly low-income women ([Brown-Johnson et al. 2014](#ch2.ref68)). The use of tobacco products is a major preventable cause of oral diseases and conditions. Cigarette smoking was established as a primary cause of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx many decades ago ([U.S. Department of Health 1979](#ch2.ref509); [International Agency for Research on Cancer 1986](#ch2.ref245)).\n\nCigarette smoking is a major cause of periodontitis ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014](#ch2.ref521)) and a likely risk factor for dental implant failure ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014](#ch2.ref521)). The use of smokeless tobacco products is a cause of oral cancer and periodontal destruction ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1986](#ch2.ref510); [International Agency for Research on Cancer 2007](#ch2.ref247)). The use of tobacco products has been implicated in a wide range of other oral diseases and conditions, such as delayed wound healing and compromised prognosis of oral surgical procedures or periodontal treatment. Although causality cannot be inferred, a relationship with dental caries also has been suggested ([Warnakulasuriya et al. 2010](#ch2.ref551)). Cigar smoking has been specifically and causally linked to oral cancer and other adverse dental effects ([Rostron et al. 2019](#ch2.ref426)). Consequently, tobacco prevention and control is an important aspect of oral disease prevention and health promotion.\n\nAdversarial positions borne of competing interests have come to characterize tobacco control, with widespread recognition in the public health community that tobacco companies should be excluded from the development of public policy for health\u2014a principle enshrined in Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ([World Health Organization 2008](#ch2.ref570); [Collin and Hill 2015](#ch2.ref107)). The 2014 U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s report, *The Health Consequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress* ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014](#ch2.ref521)), concluded that the tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately misled the public on the risks of smoking cigarettes, including the use of advertising and promotional activities that cause the onset and continuation of smoking among adolescents and young adults. The report also found that litigation against tobacco companies reduced tobacco use in the United States by increasing product prices, restricting marketing methods, and making available industry documents for scientific analysis and strategic awareness.\n\n#### The Alcohol Industry\n\nThe [International Agency for Research on Cancer (1988)](#ch2.ref246) concluded more than 30 years ago that alcohol consumption is a cause of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver. The role of alcohol as a cause of oral and pharyngeal cancer, independently and in combination with tobacco consumption, has been confirmed by more recent reviews ([Tramacere et al. 2010](#ch2.ref501); [Reidy et al. 2011](#ch2.ref418); [de Menezes et al. 2013](#ch2.ref131); [Druesne-Pecollo et al. 2014](#ch2.ref139); [Roswell and Weiderpass 2015](#ch2.ref427); [Ogden 2018](#ch2.ref385)). Emerging evidence suggests that the alcohol industry was engaged in extensive misrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk of cancer ([Petticrew et al. 2017](#ch2.ref400)). Alcohol producers have also used advertising and retail outlets to disproportionately target low-income neighborhoods ([Hackbarth et al. 1995](#ch2.ref203); [Brenner et al. 2015](#ch2.ref66)). These activities have parallels with those of the tobacco industry and are important because the industry is involved with developing alcohol policy and in disseminating health information to the public, including school children ([Petticrew et al. 2017](#ch2.ref400)).\n\n#### The Food and Beverage Industry\n\nThe commercial activity of the food and beverage industry has been identified as a potential determinant of ill health ([Capewell and Lloyd-Williams 2018](#ch2.ref75)). This industry was first compared to the tobacco industry in 2009 ([Brownell and Warner 2009](#ch2.ref70)). In 2012, *PLOS Medicine* published a series calling attention to the \u201cgulf of critical perspectives\u201d in medical journals on the food industry\u2019s role in creating the epidemic of obesity and associated diseases, including dental caries ([PLoS Medicine Editors 2012](#ch2.ref411)). Since then, a growing number of studies have documented food and beverage industry strategies and tactics to maintain an environment that encourages obesity and dental caries, including aggressive lobbying of regulators, legislators, and governments; the co-opting of domestic and international nutrition experts; deceptive and attractive marketing to children; targeting of minorities and emerging economies; undisclosed conflicts of interest; shifting of the obesity research agenda toward physical activity; and opposition to beverage taxes and warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages, among others ([Nestle 2018](#ch2.ref374)).\n\n### Vulnerable Populations and Oral Health Disparities\n\nDifferences in oral health status among individuals and within groups can arise for a variety of reasons. [Figure 2](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig2/?report=objectonly) provides a representation of these broad categories of disease determinants, including biological (genetics), behavioral (oral hygiene practices), and social or structural factors related to how society organizes, distributes, and incentivizes the use of resources such as dental insurance in ways that may either promote or harm oral health. The insidious effects of racism on health\u2014not just as individually expressed bias, but as policies and practices that have been incorporated into the structures of health care delivery systems\u2014also are now being recognized as major and complex determinants of health inequities ([Bailey et al. 2021](#ch2.ref41)). The impact of these structural factors can be seen in dentistry as well.\n\n[Warnecke and colleagues (2008)](#ch2.ref552) make an important distinction between individual-level determinants and population-level determinants of health. Population-level determinants exert health effects, independent of individual characteristics, and consequently require population-level interventions to remediate their health-harming effects. They distinguish between population-level determinants that exert a health effect because of the inequitable distribution of health-promoting resources or that result from fundamental biological differences among groups. When it is the former, differences in health status are considered to be not only health disparities, but health *inequities* that require social or population-level remedies as a matter of social justice.\n\nAs defined by WHO, the SDoH are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. The distribution of money, power and resources are influenced by any number of policy choices ([Marmot and Bell 2009](#ch2.ref318)). As a result, different forms of social and economic vulnerability or exclusion can be said to influence oral health and its related outcomes and result in disparities between groups when one is more advantaged and another less advantaged ([Marmot and Bell 2009](#ch2.ref318); [World Health Organization 2020](#ch2.ref571)).\n\nThe federal government classifies certain groups as being at higher risk of developing health problems as a result of marginalization based on sociocultural status, reduced access to economic resources, age, gender, and ability. The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000 [Public Law 106\u2013525(d)] mandates that populations with health disparities include minority groups, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, as well as rural populations, persons with low socioeconomic status, and sexual or gender minorities. The federal Healthy People 2020 initiative also identified the following groups as needing special attention and creative solutions to live a healthy life in the face of sobering health disparities and social injustices: (1) high-risk mothers, (2) chronically ill and disabled people, (3) people with HIV/AIDS, (4) mentally ill people, (5) individuals with substance use disorders, (6) homeless individuals, and (7) immigrants and refugees.\n\nSeveral definitions of disparities have been adopted by the U.S. government. HHS describes health disparities as \u201cdifferences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and environmental disadvantage\u201d ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011](#ch2.ref514), p. 2). The National Institutes of Health defines a health disparity as a \u201cdifference in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of disease and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the United States\u201d ([National Institutes of Health 2010](#ch2.ref368)). When these between-group differences are the result of unjust distribution of health-promoting resources, they are more appropriately referred to as inequities in health.\n\nHigh-quality national data are available to document oral health disparities for several different population subgroups, including those with low income, African Americans (Black), Hispanics, Asian Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), and individuals with complex health conditions. However, the lack of nationally representative data or an adequate literature base hinders understanding of how differences in oral health may exist for other groups, such as the frail elderly, those with mental illness, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other individuals.\n\n#### Low-Income Populations\n\nThe idea that \u201cthe poor oral health of poor people is explained by personal neglect\u201d ([Sanders et al. 2006](#ch2.ref444) p. 71) is not supported by research from the United States and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. Instead, oral health is determined by numerous factors that operate at the personal, social, and environmental levels. These determinants include genetics, behavior, and diet, as well as social, economic, and living conditions ([Lee and Divaris 2014](#ch2.ref293); [Peres et al. 2019](#ch2.ref398)).\n\nIt is now generally recognized that the adverse relationship between economic circumstances and oral health spans the entire income distribution, although people who are worse off financially have more dental disease, on average, than those who are more affluent. For dental caries, not only has an income gradient persisted over time among U.S. children and adolescents, it may be worsening. Using nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for three time points from 1988 to 2014, [Slade and Sanders (2017)](#ch2.ref475) examined the income gradient for children and adolescents in three age groups. For each survey period, they computed four categories of the income-to-poverty ratio to illustrate this gradient in disease ([Figure 4 A](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)\u2013[D](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)), adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, rural\u2013urban location, head-of-household education, and period since last dental visit. During 1988\u20131994, children aged 2 to 5 years living below the poverty threshold had 2.4 more decayed or filled primary tooth surfaces than their counterparts from families with income at least three times the poverty threshold. By 2011\u20132012, the disparity had increased to 4.2 affected tooth surfaces ([Figure 4A](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)). During the same interval, the disparity increased among older children in primary ([Figure 4B](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)) and permanent dentition ([Figures 4C](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly) and [4D](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)). For several groups, the magnitude of disparity in children\u2019s dental caries experience almost doubled during this period.\n\n#### [Figure 4](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)\n\nChildren\u2019s dental caries experience by primary or permanent teeth in four income categories: United States, 1988\u20131994, 1999\u20132004, and 2011\u20132012. Notes: \u0394 = absolute difference in mean caries between lowest and highest [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig4/?report=objectonly)\n\nIt is notable that this worsening of disparities in dental caries occurred during a period of increasing dental care utilization by low-income individuals aged 2 to 18 years, according to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. From 2000 to 2012, the rate of any use of dental services by children living in families below the poverty level increased from 27% to 36%, the greatest increase for any income group ([Nasseh and Vujicic 2016b](#ch2.ref358)). Meanwhile, child poverty deepened in the United States, rising from 11% in 1999 to 15% in 2014 ([Chaudry et al. 2016](#ch2.ref94)). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, at a population level, increased utilization of dental care among low-income children did not lessen disparities in children\u2019s dental caries. One explanation could be that dental office visits alone have a limited capacity to prevent development of future carious lesions in primary teeth when disease risk is being driven primarily by social and commercial determinants.\n\n#### Rural Populations\n\nMore than 60 million Americans (18%) reside in rural areas; of these, 34 million live in a dental health provider shortage area ([Barnett et al. 2018](#ch2.ref43)). Compared to their urban counterparts, rural residents face worse oral health outcomes across the lifespan, are less likely to receive preventive dental services, and are more likely to seek dental care in the ED ([Walker et al. 2014](#ch2.ref544); [Geiger et al. 2019](#ch2.ref179)). Rural adults have nearly double the prevalence of edentulism (tooth loss) than nonrural populations ([Vargas et al. 2002](#ch2.ref534)). Rates of untreated dental caries are higher among rural populations in the South but not in other parts of the United States ([Vargas et al. 2003](#ch2.ref535); [Maserejian et al. 2008](#ch2.ref321); [Dawkins et al. 2013](#ch2.ref130)).\n\nOral health disparities that persist in other subpopulations are compounded by rurality. Rural persons of color, including Black and AI/AN populations and migrant workers and their children, face disproportionately higher rates of untreated dental disease and have lower rates of dental utilization than their suburban and urban counterparts ([Quandt et al. 2009](#ch2.ref416); [Wu et al. 2012](#ch2.ref573); [Schroeder et al. 2019](#ch2.ref451)). AI/AN adults and children, many of whom reside in rural areas, have extremely high levels of dental disease, including untreated dental caries, periodontal disease, oral pain, and tooth loss ([Phipps and Ricks 2015](#ch2.ref406); [Phipps and Ricks 2016](#ch2.ref407)).\n\nThe causes of worse oral health outcomes in rural communities are multifactorial. Rural communities have fewer dentists and require longer travel time to reach dental care ([Cao et al. 2017](#ch2.ref74); [Barnett et al. 2018](#ch2.ref43)). They also have lower rates of insurance coverage and Medicaid eligibility ([Martin et al. 2012](#ch2.ref319)). Although rural dentists are more likely to accept Medicaid than their urban counterparts, rates of acceptance are still not high enough to meet the need for oral health services in the rural Medicaid population ([Cao et al. 2017](#ch2.ref74)). In general, when compared to urban areas, rural areas have lower dentist-to-population ratios, more residents who lack dental insurance, and higher unemployment and poverty rates. As a result, roughly 2 in 5 rural Americans are essentially without access to dental care ([National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health 2013](#ch2.ref370)).\n\nIn addition to these structural barriers to care, cultural norms, such as dental anxiety and pessimism about the achievability of oral health, also may contribute to rural-urban disparities in oral health outcomes ([Chen et al. 2019](#ch2.ref95)). Rural populations have lower average levels of oral health literacy, a risk factor for poor oral health-related quality of life in rural communities ([Gaber et al. 2017](#ch2.ref173); [VanWormer et al. 2018](#ch2.ref533)). Oral health literacy is defined as \u201cthe degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic oral health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\u201d ([National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research 2005](#ch2.ref367)). Adding to these risk factors, rural populations have less access to the preventive benefits of fluoridated water and use tobacco products more\u2014both combustible and noncombustible\u2014than urban residents, with the accompanying increased risk of periodontal disease and oral and pharyngeal cancers ([Roberts et al. 2016](#ch2.ref425)). Combined, these factors contribute to a rural oral disease disparity through increased disease liability and reduced access to preventive and reparative dental services.\n\n#### Black or African American Populations\n\nDespite progress in past decades, more recent data show there are persistent and significant disparities in dental caries experience and untreated caries between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations. National Health Survey data have shown that among children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, the prevalence of total dental caries experience and of untreated caries were significantly higher in non-Hispanic Black youth compared with non-Hispanic White youth ([Figure 5](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig5/?report=objectonly)) ([Fleming and Afful 2018](#ch2.ref163)). However, for working-age adults, dental caries were highly prevalent and consistent regardless of race/ethnicity, but substantial disparities do exist with the prevalence of untreated caries affecting 2 in 5 non-Hispanic Black adults ([Figure 6](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig6/?report=objectonly)). Root caries were significantly higher among non-Hispanic Blacks (40%) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (less than 20%) ([Griffin et al. 2012](#ch2.ref192)).\n\n#### [Figure 5](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig5/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of youth ages 2\u201319 with total dental caries and untreated dental caries in primary and permanent teeth by race/ethnicity: United Stales, 2015\u20132016. Note: Includes dental caries in both primary and permanent teeth.\n\n#### [Figure 6](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig6/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of adults ages 20\u201364 with dental caries and untreated dental caries by race/ethnicity; United States, 2011\u20132016. Notes: Prevalence of dental caries (DFT > 0) and untreated dental caries (DT > 0) in permanent [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig6/?report=objectonly)\n\nMost current National Health Survey data show that the prevalence of periodontal disease among adults aged 30 years or older is higher among non-Hispanic Blacks (57%) and Mexican Americans (60%) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (37%), with severe periodontitis being more than twice as prevalent among Blacks (15%) compared to Whites (6%) ([Eke et al. 2018](#ch2.ref150)). There also are clear disparities in tooth loss between Blacks and Whites, with complete tooth loss more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black adults 65 years or older (28%) compared with their non-Hispanic White adult counterparts (17%) ([Dye et al. 2019](#ch2.ref145)). About 17% of Hispanics aged 65 and older are edentulous.\n\nAn analysis of 2000\u20132010 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence data showed that non-Hispanic White men had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate of oropharyngeal cancer (14.1 per 100,000) than non-Hispanic Black men (11.9 per 100,000) ([Weatherspoon et al. 2015](#ch2.ref558)). This is contrary to the historical trend that Black men had a much higher incidence than White men ([Morse and Kerr 2006](#ch2.ref351)). This reversal of incidence rates was linked to decreased rates of smoking and heavy alcohol use among Black men, decreased incidence rates of human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative oral and oropharyngeal cancers, and an ongoing increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer linked to HPV among White men and women ([National Cancer Institute 2018](#ch2.ref366)). Non-Hispanic White women also had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate (5.3 per 100,000) than non-Hispanic Black women (4.0 per 100,000) ([Weatherspoon et al. 2015](#ch2.ref558)).\n\nAlthough the incidence trends in oral and oropharyngeal cancers have changed, disparities in survival rates persist. For example, in 2007\u20132013, the relative 5-year survival rate of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx for Black men was 47%, compared with 68.7% in White men. A similar pattern was seen for Black and White women, with 60.3% and 70.1% survival rates, respectively ([National Cancer Institute 2018](#ch2.ref366)).\n\n#### Hispanic Populations\n\nIn the 1970s, ethnicity was introduced by the U.S. Census Bureau and used for categorizing Hispanics ([Valde\u00f3n 2013](#ch2.ref529)); these were individuals who identified themselves as being of Spanish-speaking background. \u201cHispanic origin\u201d currently is defined by the Census Bureau as \u201cthe heritage, nationality, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person\u2019s parents or ancestors before arriving in the United States. Individuals who identify as Hispanic, Latinx, or Spanish may be any race\u201d ([U.S. Census Bureau 2019](#ch2.ref507)). Hispanics comprise the largest ethnic group in the United States, estimated at 18.1% in 2017 ([U.S. Department of Commerce 2018](#ch2.ref508)). Although Hispanics are of diverse heritage ([Rumbaut 2006](#ch2.ref432)), the largest subgroup is of Mexican origin ([Pew Research Center 2012](#ch2.ref402); [Brown and Lopez 2013](#ch2.ref69)). Available clinical oral health data from the NHANES has focused on the Mexican American subgroup because of an insufficient number of non-Mexican Hispanics for subgroup analysis.\n\nHispanic adults have a higher prevalence of oral disease than non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanic children appear to be worse off than their White counterparts on other indicators of oral or health status and access to care, based on national survey data. Analysis of the 2007 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH) found that Hispanic children aged 3 to 18 years had worse oral health status (based on mothers\u2019 rating as \u201cfair or poor\u201d) and were less likely to have obtained preventive dental care services in the past year than were non-Hispanic White or Black children ([Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o and Wehby 2012b](#ch2.ref198)). In 2016\u20132017 NSCH estimates, the condition of 7.2% of Hispanic children\u2019s (aged 1\u201317 years) teeth was characterized as \u201cfair or poor,\u201d compared with 4.2% among non-Hispanic Whites ([Data Resource Center for Child and Adolescent Health 2020](#ch2.ref127)).\n\nNHANES estimates are available for Mexican Americans and those who identify as Hispanic. In the 2015\u20132016 NHANES, dental caries experience was highest among Hispanic youth compared to non-Hispanic Black, Asian, and White youth with more than half (57%) of youth aged 2 to 19 years having caries ([Figure 5](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig5/?report=objectonly)) ([Fleming and Afful 2018](#ch2.ref163)). Based on the 2011\u20132016 NHANES, 37% of Mexican American adults aged 20 to 64 years experienced untreated dental caries ([Figure 6](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig6/?report=objectonly)) and, for Mexican American adults 65 years or older, 36% had untreated dental caries, the highest among race/ethnic groups for older Americans ([Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019](#ch2.ref82)). National Health Survey data show that Mexican American adults 30 years or older had the highest prevalence of periodontal disease among all racial or ethnic groups ([Eke et al. 2018](#ch2.ref150)).\n\nTooth loss is an oral health status indicator for which Hispanics appear to be doing as well as or better than other racial or ethnic groups. The prevalence of complete tooth loss among Hispanic adults 50 years or older was similar to non-Hispanic Whites (9% vs. 11%) from 2009\u20132014. However, larger differences benefiting Hispanics exist between them and non-Hispanic Whites living in poverty (12% vs. 28%) ([Dye et al. 2019](#ch2.ref145)).\n\nCurrently, about half of Hispanic Americans were not born in the United States ([Krogstad and Lopez 2014](#ch2.ref286)). Research with Hispanics often explores differences between U.S.-born and foreign-born people, and how those factors (e.g., duration of U.S. residence, level of acculturation, language preferences, ethnic identity) may influence health status and health behaviors. Acculturation plays a role in accessing adult dental services and may act to moderate differences in oral health behaviors and outcomes ([Gao and McGrath 2010](#ch2.ref175)). English speakers are more likely to report a dental visit in the past year than Spanish speakers ([Graham et al. 2005](#ch2.ref190); [Riley et al. 2008](#ch2.ref423); [Jaramillo et al. 2009](#ch2.ref254)). Spanish-speaking adults of Mexican origin in the 2009\u20132012 NHANES were 1.8 times more likely to have periodontitis than English speakers ([Garcia et al. 2017](#ch2.ref176)).\n\nA \u201cHispanic paradox\u201d or \u201cLatinx advantage\u201d has been observed for many health conditions ([McCarthy 2015](#ch2.ref326)), including some oral health status and related measures ([Sanders 2010](#ch2.ref437); [Spolsky et al. 2012](#ch2.ref483)). Although many Hispanics live in poverty in the United States and may encounter access to care barriers, Hispanic immigrants often have better health outcomes than U.S.-born Hispanics. Better clinically assessed oral health also has been documented among Mexican immigrants compared to the U.S.-born ([Spolsky et al. 2012](#ch2.ref483)) and the more acculturated immigrants ([Gao and McGrath 2010](#ch2.ref175)). Better self-rated oral health quality of life also has been documented among first-generation Latino adults than among their U.S.-born Latino counterparts or Whites ([Sanders 2010](#ch2.ref437)). However, varying elements of oral health quality of life can be influenced by the level of acculturation and Hispanic/Latino background ([Silveira et al. 2020](#ch2.ref464)). Furthermore, a systematic review of Hispanic and immigrant paradoxes concluded that these health advantages are not consistently found across studies and groups ([Teruya and Bazargan-Hejazi 2013](#ch2.ref493)).\n\n#### American Indian and Alaska Native Populations\n\nAn estimated 5.2 million people identify as AI/AN, and about 29% live below the federal poverty line ([Norris et al. 2012](#ch2.ref377); [Mauer 2017](#ch2.ref323)). For AI/AN adults, the burden of disease is greater than that of any other ethnic minority group ([Batliner 2016](#ch2.ref46)). When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children aged 3 to 5 years have more than double the number of decayed teeth and nearly twice the overall dental caries experience than the next highest ethnic group, Hispanics (Mexican Americans), and almost three times that of White children ([Figure 7](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig7/?report=objectonly)) ([Phipps et al. 2019](#ch2.ref408)). For AI/AN children aged 6 to 9 years, 80% have a history of dental caries compared with only 45% of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated dental caries compared to just 17% of the general U.S. population in this age group.\n\n#### [Figure 7](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig7/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children ages 3\u20135 with early childhood caries (ECC) during 2018\u20132019 in relation to other same-age children in the United States by race/ethnicity during 2013\u20132014.\n\nSevere periodontal disease was reported for 17% of AI/AN adults aged 35 years or older (28% for those who smoke), compared to 10% of U.S. adults ([Phipps and Ricks 2016](#ch2.ref407)). Tooth loss was common in AI/AN adults aged 40 to 64 years, where loss of at least one permanent tooth occurred in 83% of AI/AN adults ([Phipps and Ricks 2016](#ch2.ref407)), compared to 66% for adults in the U.S. population as a whole (NHANES 2011\u20132012) ([Dye et al. 2015](#ch2.ref142)).\n\n#### Oral Health and Structural Racism\n\nThe racial concerns that permeate American society unmistakably contribute to the oral health disparities that have been observed throughout the United States and, as described above, represent one of society\u2019s greatest challenges. Systemic, or institutional, racism is created by factors embedded in a social structure that reflects the perspectives and needs of a white majority and that, consequently, disadvantage people of color. Structural aspects of public organizations focused on education, housing, criminal justice, and health care incorporate these biases in a variety of ways ([Feagin and Ducey 2014](#ch2.ref156)), and dental care is no exception. Black populations, Hispanics, and some other minority racial populations have much lower family incomes and experience much higher rates of poverty than does the White population ([Semega et al. 2020](#ch2.ref458)). These financial disparities interact with the dental health care system to create major disadvantages for members of racial minority groups. Structural features of the dental care system result in high out-of-pocket costs for many, and family-level economic factors such as income, poverty status, and dental insurance play critical roles in the ability to access routine dental care ([Vujicic et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref541)). The delivery of dental care services usually requires the ability to pay personally or through individual insurance, thereby directly limiting care to those with greater financial resources. The ability to access dental insurance, which comes more readily with higher paying and more stable employment is, in turn, also linked to race. Moreover, dental services may not be readily available in areas where many people of color live, because the structure of payment for services provides lower incentives for providers who would locate in those areas. As a major contributor to the SDoH, systemic racism also indirectly impacts oral health through various structural, sociocultural, and familial mechanisms, that, like financial and educational resources, are differentially distributed across racial groups. Historical experiences with health care that can create mistrust of the system may be linked to race as well. A scoping review of the persistence of oral health disparities of African American children ([Como et al. 2019](#ch2.ref114)) found numerous factors had contributed to poorer oral health among African American families, including less access to affordable non-cariogenic food, fear and distrust of the care delivery system, lower health literacy, and social stigmatization.\n\nThese patterns can be seen in the few published studies of inequity in dental care. Treatment for existing dental disease, a measure of access to dental care, is highly correlated with race/ethnicity ([Gupta et al. 2018](#ch2.ref200)). This is reflected by the national data that show clearly that African American, AI/AN, and Hispanic populations all have higher rates of untreated dental caries and tooth loss, as well as poorer access to preventive services ([Koppelman 2016a](#ch2.ref281)). Dentists\u2019 treatment decisions, too, have been shown to be affected by unconscious racial bias; for example, in a randomized clinical study of tooth restorability, treatment recommendations were found to favor extractions over root canal treatment for Black patients ([Patel et al. 2019](#ch2.ref396)). Adding to these broad social problems, the profession of dentistry reflects substantial underrepresentation of Black dentists in the workforce ([Mertz et al. 2017](#ch2.ref341)).\n\nIncreasing the diversity of the dental workforce could contribute in important ways to oral health equity through changes in dental practice arrangements ([Mertz et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref342)) and enhanced patient trust and satisfaction with care ([Cooper et al. 2003](#ch2.ref116)).\n\n### Impact of COVID-19 on Oral Health Inequities\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has upended every aspect of life and has clear and significant implications for the inequities related to oral health and access to dental care that are the focus of this chapter. Inequities related to COVID-19 have already been theoretically and empirically identified in terms of the risk of acquiring the disease, experience with the disease, the ability to access testing and be treated for the disease, mortality associated with the disease, outcomes associated with interventions that limit transmission of the disease, and access to the personal protections provided by governments to facilitate survival during the pandemic.\n\nSadly, this is not surprising. It would make sense that, like almost all other diseases, medical conditions and/or associated preventive or curative treatments, exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the outcomes of COVID-19 would be socially patterned and influenced by the social and commercial determinants of health.\n\nIn turn, such vulnerability may worsen existing inequities in oral health and access to dental care. The economic effects of COVID-19 have resulted in loss of work, income, insurance, and opportunity for individuals and families, which as this chapter has shown, are all causally linked to poor oral health and lack of access to dental care, whether at the individual or population level. Without appropriate supports, a racially, socially, and/or economically marginalized family may not have enough income to secure a healthy diet, will experience significant psychosocial stress, and will have less access to the benefits of dental care, all of which increase the risk for acquiring oral diseases and increasing their negative outcomes. Such a damning state of affairs represents a vicious cycle that engenders poverty and the loss of personal security, prosperity, and dignity ([Armitage and Nellums 2020](#ch2.ref32); [Gausman and Langer 2020](#ch2.ref177); [Ji et al. 2020](#ch2.ref257); [Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 et al. 2020](#ch2.ref450); [van Dorn et al. 2020](#ch2.ref530); [Van Lancker and Parolin 2020](#ch2.ref531); [Wang and Tang 2020](#ch2.ref549); [Yancy 2020](#ch2.ref576); [Yao et al. 2020](#ch2.ref577)).\n\n### Oral Health for Those with Special Health Care Needs\n\nHRSA\u2019s Maternal and Child Health Bureau defines children with SHCN as \u201c\u2026those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally\u201d ([McPherson et al. 1998](#ch2.ref333); [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2013](#ch2.ref515) p. 5). Children with SHCNs become adolescents and adults with SHCNs and experience challenges throughout their lives. According to the 2017\u20132018 NSCH, about 1 in 6 children from birth to 17 years (18.51%) in the United States, or 13.6 million children, has SHCNs ([Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative 2020](#ch2.ref99)). In addition, an estimated 26% of U.S. adults, or 61 million people 18 aged years or older, have some type of disability ([Okoro et al. 2018](#ch2.ref386)).\n\nAs the population of the United States is becoming more diverse, the incidence of SHCNs increasingly applies to persons with varying ethnic, racial, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. It also includes individuals whose social living situations are restricted because of dependency needs or other factors that prohibit them from living in the community. These individuals include, but are not limited to, people residing in long-term care and institutional facilities, and prison settings. The presence of a special need, as described in this section, has a profound impact on the ability of an individual to function in society and on the organization, function, and economics of many societal structures.\n\nIndividuals with SHCNs may be at increased risk for oral diseases throughout their lives ([Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative 2020](#ch2.ref99)). Oral diseases can have a significant impact on the health and quality of life of those with certain systemic health problems or conditions. Patients with compromised immunity or cardiac conditions associated with endocarditis may be especially vulnerable to the effects of oral diseases ([Thikkurissy and Lal 2009](#ch2.ref495)). Persons with physical, mental, and developmental disabilities who do not have the ability to understand, assume responsibility for, or cooperate with preventive oral health practices are susceptible, as well ([Charles 2010](#ch2.ref91); [American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry 2016](#ch2.ref14)).\n\nSHCNs also include disorders or conditions that manifest only in the orofacial complex (such as amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis imperfecta, cleft lip/palate, or oral cancer) ([Charles 2010](#ch2.ref91)). Although these individuals may not exhibit the same physical or communicative limitations as other people with SHCNs, their needs are unique, impact their overall health, and require oral health care of a specialized nature ([Charles 2010](#ch2.ref91)).\n\nThe importance of oral health care for individuals with SHCNs also was highlighted in the 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Oral Health and in Healthy People 2020 ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2000](#ch2.ref511); [2010a](#ch2.ref513)). The Healthy People 2020 objectives included increasing the number of states (and the District of Columbia) that have an oral and craniofacial health surveillance system\u2014a system for recording and referring infants and children with cleft lips and palates\u2014and a system for referring such children to rehabilitative teams.\n\n### Oral Health in Correctional Settings\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with 2.3 million people incarcerated annually ([Sawyer and Wagner 2019](#ch2.ref447)). Incarceration disproportionately affects people of color and those of low socioeconomic status. Incarcerated individuals are the only individuals in the country with a legal right to health care, a precedent that has been ruled to include access to timely dental treatment ([Nolasco and Vaughn 2019](#ch2.ref375)). Nonetheless, incarceration is associated with higher rates of chronic illness, serious mental illness, infectious disease, and a lower life expectancy ([Wildeman and Wang 2017](#ch2.ref562)). These health conditions have shared behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors with poor oral health. Rates of dental disease are similarly elevated in incarcerated populations.\n\nCompared to the noninstitutionalized population, individuals residing in correctional facilities have higher rates of untreated decay, worse periodontal health, and a higher prevalence of urgent dental needs; the number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth in this population is 17.0\u201322.1 in adults and 3.6 in juveniles ([Mlxson et al. 1990](#ch2.ref348); [Clare 1998](#ch2.ref100); [Heng 2000](#ch2.ref217); [Bolin and Jones 2006](#ch2.ref57)). Although oral health status may improve somewhat during the period of incarceration, presumably because of increased access to dental care while incarcerated, prevalence of untreated disease remains high even after 3 years of incarceration ([Clare 2002](#ch2.ref101)). In the 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (now known as the Survey of Prison Inmates), 60% of respondents reported having a dental problem during incarceration, and only 80% of adults in prison with a dental problem reported seeing a dentist ([Nowotny 2017](#ch2.ref381); [Maruschak 2019](#ch2.ref320)).\n\n### Financing Dental Care\n\nThe dental care financing mix continues to differ significantly from that of medical care. In 2019, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) programs accounted for 37% of medical care spending, with out-of-pocket payments accounting for 11% and private medical insurance, 31% ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2019a](#ch2.ref83)). In contrast, 10% of costs for dental care were paid by a CMS source, 40% were paid out of pocket, and 46% were covered by private dental insurance in 2018 (see [Figure 3](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/figure/ch7.fig3/?report=objectonly), [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/) in this monograph) ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2020a](#ch2.ref86)). Dental care spending has grown more slowly than overall medical care spending with dental care accounting for 3.7% of total health care spending in the United States in 2017, compared to 4.5% in 2000 ([American Dental Association 2017](#ch2.ref18)).\n\nThe cost of dental care remains an obstacle for many Americans, with dental care consistently presenting the highest financial barrier of any health service in the United States ([Vujicic et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref541)). Dental insurance alleviates this concern for some, and in 2018, roughly 80% of Americans had some form of private or public dental coverage ([National Association of Dental Plans 2020](#ch2.ref364)). However, dental insurance coverage varies substantially by age group in the United States with the percentage of coverage declining with age (see [Section 2A](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch3/), [Figure 36](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch3/figure/ch3.fig36/?report=objectonly)). The majority of Americans, about two-thirds, received coverage through employment-based plans or through organizations like AARP, and a small percentage (around 10%) purchased coverage through private dental plans or as part of a medical plan ([National Association of Dental Plans 2020](#ch2.ref364)). In 2018, publicly funded dental insurance provided coverage for roughly one-fourth of Americans through a variety of programs, including Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Veterans Health Administration, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Indian Health Service, and others.\n\nThe result is that dental insurance coverage, when available, consists of a patchwork of public and private plans that vary widely in eligibility requirements, the benefits provided, and the availability of participating dentists. Moreover, many of those with dental insurance still incur high out-of-pocket costs. In 2018, about 66.7 million Americans had no dental coverage with a dentally uninsured rate of 2.5 times higher than the medically uninsured rate ([National Association of Dental Plans 2020](#ch2.ref364)). For those without coverage, routine dental care is often financially out of reach. For example, older adults are less likely to have employment-based dental insurance, yet as of this writing, Medicare, the primary provider of medical insurance for individuals aged 65 years and older, does not include routine dental care in its mandated services.\n\nHaving dental insurance, either public (Medicaid) or private, has been shown to improve access to dental care. Among older adults, having private insurance increased preventive service use by 25% and having Medicaid coverage increased major service use by 36% ([Meyerhoefer et al. 2019](#ch2.ref344)). Expansion of dental coverage in Medicare also is estimated to improve access to dental care for older adults ([Kreider et al. 2015](#ch2.ref283)). Insurance coverage alone will not be sufficient to increase access to dental services for older adults, however. Other factors, such as having an accessible and sufficient dental professional workforce, a culture of self-care and utilization of health care, and social support, particularly for older adults, must accompany improvements in dental care financing. Current federal government-sponsored dental health insurance programs include Medicaid and CHIP. Medicaid provides health coverage for millions of Americans, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by states, according to federal requirements, and jointly funded by states and the federal government. CHIP provides health coverage to eligible children through both Medicaid and separate CHIP programs. To date, nearly all state Medicaid programs have expanded dental program services and are implementing a variety of models aimed at increasing dental care access and capacity for a growing number of eligible individuals, although earlier expansion had benefited children more than adults. There are currently two states that do not provide a Medicaid dental benefit to the adult base population ([Figure 8](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig8/?report=objectonly)) ([Center for Healthcare Strategies, 2019](#ch2.ref79)).\n\n#### [Figure 8](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig8/?report=objectonly)\n\nStatus of Medicaid adult dental benefit coverage by state: United States, 2019. Notes: a North Dakota does not offer adult dental benefits to its Medicaid expansion population.\n\nHaving dental insurance has been shown to provide a substantial increase in children\u2019s use of needed dental services, resulting in less untreated disease. Importantly, children enrolled in public insurance programs such as Medicaid or CHIP have been shown to receive the greatest benefit in terms of access and disease reduction, compared to those who are not publicly insured ([Yu et al. 2017](#ch2.ref579)). Moreover, when Medicaid coverage is offered to adults there is some evidence that the benefits go beyond increased access to care and include improved oral health, improved job outcomes, and possibly decreases in oral health disparities ([Kieffer et al. 2021](#ch2.ref272)). Additional discussion on dental insurance can be found in [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/).\n\nIn addition to dental insurance, the federal government supports funding for direct patient care through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). HRSA\u2019s mission is to improve health outcomes and address health disparities through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce, and innovative, high-value programming ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2019a](#ch2.ref212)). The agency provides primary health care to the geographically isolated and to the economically or medically vulnerable, such as people with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, and mothers. HRSA supports the training of health professionals, the distribution of providers to areas where they are needed most, and improvements in health care delivery.\n\n### Dental Care Delivery Models\n\nThe delivery of dental care occurs in a wide variety of settings using different models of care that vary with respect to their financing and workforce structure. Dentists typically work in settings that include private practice, armed forces and other federal services (e.g., Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), state or local government employees, dental school faculty and staff and hospital personnel, and a variety of other health/dental organizations. Licensed dentists also are enrolled as graduate students, interns, and residents. Detailed information on the members of the dental team is provided in [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/).\n\n#### Private Practice\n\nIn the United States, private practice has been and remains the predominant setting in which most Americans receive dental care. In 2018, an estimated 93% of dentists reported that private practice was their primary care delivery setting ([American Dental Association 2020a](#ch2.ref20)). This proportion has been roughly stable since 2000, and private practice remains the career aspiration for most current dental students ([Wanchek et al. 2015](#ch2.ref547)).\n\nHowever, there have been changes to the structure of typical private practices since 2000. Namely, the proportion of dentists in solo practice has declined from 64% in 2000 to 50% in 2018, as dentists increasingly practice in larger group settings ([American Dental Association 2021](#ch2.ref19)). There also is a growing interest among dental students in salaried positions in corporate or nonprofit organizations ([Wanchek et al. 2015](#ch2.ref547)).\n\n#### Federally Qualified Health Centers\n\nThe federal Health Center Program (HCP) is authorized in Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act of 1944 (42 U.S.C. Sections 201 et seq.) and is administered by HRSA. FQHCs form a cornerstone of the health care safety net. They are required to provide health care to all individuals regardless of their ability to pay and must be located in geographic areas with relatively few health care providers ([Heisler 2015](#ch2.ref215); [Crall et al. 2016](#ch2.ref119)). HRSA funds nearly 1,400 health centers operating more than 13,000 service delivery sites. Nearly 29 million people in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin rely on HRSA-funded health centers for care. In 2020, HRSA\u2019s HCP provided primary health care to 1 in 11 individuals of all ages in the United States, 1 in 9 children, 1 in 5 rural residents, 1 in 3 people living in poverty, and more than 376,000 veterans ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2021a](#ch2.ref211)). Most of these patients were publicly insured for medical care: 46.9% were covered by Medicaid/CHIP, 10.4% by Medicare, and 21.8% were uninsured ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2021a](#ch2.ref211)). These groups generally face substantial barriers to oral health care access, thereby underscoring the importance of additional investments geared toward expanding the oral health care capacity at more FQHC sites.\n\nFQHCs have become an important dental care access point for vulnerable populations. An estimated 25% of low-income dental care patients received their care at an FQHC in 2017, compared to 7% in 2001. In 2020, HRSA\u2019s HCP facilities provided more than 11.3 million dental visits to nearly 5.2 million patients ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2021b](#ch2.ref208)). Most of these patients were publicly insured for medical care\u201446.9% were covered by Medicaid/CHIP, 10.4% by Medicare, and 21.8% were uninsured ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2021a](#ch2.ref211)). These groups generally face substantial barriers to oral health care access, thereby underscoring the importance of additional investments geared toward expanding the oral health care capacity at more FQHC sites.\n\nNearly 93% of HRSA\u2019s health center grantees provide preventive dental services either on-site or by paid referral ([Health Resources and Service Administration 2021b](#ch2.ref208)).\n\n#### School-Based Health Centers and School-Based Dental Programs\n\nSchool-based health centers (SBHC) are systems of interdisciplinary health services provided to students within pre-K\u201312 schools (school-based centers) or at offsite health facilities linked to the schools (school-linked centers). SBHCs often are established in schools that serve predominantly low-income communities. They must provide primary health care and also may include mental health care, social services, dentistry, immunizations, reproductive health services for adolescents, substance abuse counseling, complex case management\u2014including management of such chronic illnesses as asthma and obesity\u2014and nutrition and general health education. Student participation requires parental consent.\n\nThe 2013\u20132014 Census of SBHCs showed that there were 2,315 SBHCs nationwide, and 18% of SBHCs had oral health professionals on site. School-based oral health programs provide a range of services that encourage an ongoing relationship with a dentist, including oral health education and promotion, dental screenings and referrals, dental sealants, fluoride mouth rinses or tablets, fluoride varnish applications, case management, and restorative treatment. Advantages of school-based oral health programs include improvements in access to dental care, timelier oral health care for children with unmet treatment needs, positive peer modeling, the elimination of barriers (such as lack of transportation and need for parental time off from work), and fewer missed school days for dental appointments. The majority of school-based oral health programs are operated by dental organizations or state oral health programs and are funded by state and local governments (including state block grants), corporations, private foundations, and billings to Medicaid, CHIP, private insurance, and patients\u2019 families. Challenges in this setting include school leadership and staff buy-in, dependence on parental consents, care coordination for further treatment, and quality assurance tracking.\n\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF), whose members are appointed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was established in 1996 to identify evidence-supported population health interventions that can save lives, increase lifespans, and improve quality of life ([Community Preventive Services Task Force 2021](#ch2.ref113)). CPSTF recommends the implementation and maintenance of SBHCs in low-income communities, based on evidence that they improve educational and health outcomes and that their societal benefits are greater than the intervention costs ([Community Prevention Services Task Force 2016a](#ch2.ref111)). CPSTF also recommends school-based sealant delivery programs based on evidence that dental sealants resulted in a significant reduction in tooth decay among school children aged 5 to 16 years and the economic benefits of this reduction exceeded the cost of the programs ([Community Preventive Services Task Force 2016b](#ch2.ref112)).\n\n#### Veterans\u2019 Health Administration\n\nAlthough veterans usually qualify for health benefits from VA, most do not qualify for dental care. Dental services offered through VA facilities are more limited than medical services and are restricted to certain categories of veterans. Currently, less than 5% of the total U.S. veteran population is eligible to receive dental care from VA ([U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 2019](#ch2.ref527)). Because Medicare does not cover dental care and so few are eligible to access VA oral health services, many veterans\u2014most of whom are older\u2014have unmet dental needs. Overall, veterans have a higher prevalence of periodontal disease, dental caries, and missing teeth, compared to non-veterans, but this higher prevalence is strongly associated with membership in other groups at high risk for poor oral health (older adults, smokers, males, and diabetics) ([Schindler et al. 2021](#ch2.ref449)). As a group, veterans\u2019 unmet oral health care needs are primarily related to periodontitis ([Schindler et al. 2021](#ch2.ref449)).\n\nThe VA Office of Dentistry provided oral health care to more than half a million U.S. military veterans in fiscal year 2018, totaling 1.7 million visits. VA dental clinics provide care at 236 sites. These dental clinics are staffed by 3,500 dental team members made up of more than 1,000 dentists, 400 dental hygienists, and 1,500 dental assistants. VA manages the dental care of veterans through both in-house care and community provider networks. Twenty-one percent of veterans\u2019 dental care was provided by community care providers in 2018. Since 2000, the number of VA dental patients has increased 73%. In the past 8 to 10 years, the number of veterans needing dental care has risen nearly 24%. VA dentistry has responded to that challenge with a similar increase in dentists and a 33% increase in dental hygienists. Veterans seeking care through VA dental clinics often have a higher disease burden than the general adult population ([Boehmer et al. 2001](#ch2.ref56); [Jurasic et al. 2014](#ch2.ref263)).\n\n#### Teledentistry\n\nTelehealth is the delivery of health care and the exchange of health care information across distances. Teledentistry is the application of telehealth to dentistry, using health information technology and telecommunications for oral care, consultation, education, and public awareness with the broad goal of improving oral health ([Daniel and Kumar 2014](#ch2.ref125)).\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) defines telehealth as a broad variety of technologies and tactics to deliver virtual medical, health, and education services\u2014not a specific service, but a collection of means to enhance care and education delivery ([American Dental Association 2020b](#ch2.ref15)). In 2018, two teledentistry codes were added to the Current Dental Terminology code set, which will facilitate both inclusion of relevant services in dental practice and the relationship between dental care providers and relevant payer organizations. These two codes distinguish the two modalities commonly used in telehealth care. Synchronous telehealth is live videoconferencing\u2014a two-way video link between a patient and health care provider. Asynchronous telehealth refers to \u201cstore and forward\u201d transmission of health information for later review by a health care provider ([Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology 2020](#ch2.ref384)). For additional information about teledentistry, see [Sections 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/) and [6](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch9/).\n\nTeledentistry and telehealth studies and some few systematic reviews conducted in the United States and abroad agree that telehealth interventions appear generally equivalent to in-person care ([Nutalapati et al. 2011](#ch2.ref382); [Khan and Omar 2013](#ch2.ref270); [Alabdullah and Daniel 2018](#ch2.ref10); [Shigekawa et al. 2018](#ch2.ref462)). High levels of validity and reliability have been found when comparing diagnostic information and treatment planning outcomes for midlevel screeners and a dental expert panel. In addition, providers and patients reported high levels of satisfaction with telehealth encounters ([Estai et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref152); [Estai et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref153)).\n\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19, a coronavirus spread by short-range aerosol, contact, and droplet transmission, has been responsible for millions of cases of severe illness and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide since its emergence in late 2019 ([Johns Hopkins University & Medicine 2021](#ch2.ref259)). This pandemic disrupted the delivery of dental care throughout the United States, leading to the closure of most of the nation\u2019s dental care facilities or restriction of services to emergency care only ([American Dental Association 2020c](#ch2.ref22)). The sudden and widespread closure of most sources of oral health care led to a rapidly increased interest in teledentistry and its largely untapped potential ([Emami 2020](#ch2.ref151); [Maret et al. 2020](#ch2.ref316)). Although there are no definitive data regarding the extent of teledentistry efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reports in the popular press that suggest widespread use of various teledentistry models throughout the country ([Wicklund 2020](#ch2.ref561)).\n\n#### Medical Settings\n\nInterest continues to grow regarding the role of non-dental health care providers delivering dental services in non-dental settings. The value of this approach to dental service delivery is still being determined, but the rationale is clear. More Americans visit a physician than a dentist annually. Thus, integration of dental services into the primary care setting may better serve the needs of at-risk patient groups, particularly young children for whom pediatric well-child visit schedules result in 12 medical office visits before age 3. In addition, when medical personnel engage with patients over oral health issues, it can increase awareness among all parties about the importance of oral health to overall health and provide a rationale for closer coordination and integration of medical and dental care delivery ([Haber et al. 2015](#ch2.ref202); [Vujicic 2015a](#ch2.ref538)).\n\n### Impact of COVID-19 on Dental Practice\n\nThe ADA Health Policy Institute has been examining the economic impact of COVID-19 on dentists in private practice, as well as those working in public health settings. When the White House Coronavirus Task Force, CMS, and CDC were recommending delaying elective dental care in March 2020, the vast majority of dentists were seeing only emergency cases. Informal reports indicate that during this period, many dentists and dental team members were supporting other departments by providing testing and screening services related to COVID-19.\n\nThe overall economic impact to the dental care sector of delaying elective care has been devastating. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, dentistry lost more than half a million jobs in April 2020 ([U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020](#ch2.ref506)). ADA Health Policy Institute data indicate that 45% of dentists in private practice were not paying any of their staff in April ([American Dental Association 2020d](#ch2.ref23)). Dentists in public health settings were not immune either, with 29% reporting being paid partially or not at all in April ([American Dental Association 2020e](#ch2.ref24)).\n\nEarly forecasts of the medium- to long-term economic impact of COVID-19 on the dental economy suggest anywhere from a 30% to 66% reduction in U.S. dental spending in 2020 and up to a 30% reduction in 2021 ([Nasseh and Vujicic 2020](#ch2.ref359)). However, these early analyses assumed a very gradual and slow U-shaped economic recovery in the United States and a lagging dental sector recovery. Early data on reopening suggest these early estimates were pessimistic. In other words, the data on the first 3 weeks of reopening\u2014spanning May 4 through the end of the week of May 18, 2020\u2014showed that patient volumes and economic activity in dental offices were rebounding ([American Dental Association 2020b](#ch2.ref15)). Data for the week of May 18 indicated that, on average, patient volume in private practices was up to 38% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Looking only at the 27 early opener states (those that opened in late April through the first week of May 2020), patient volume had rebounded to 54% of pre-COVID-19 levels by the third week after reopening. Thus, the recovery data, at least in the first few weeks, suggests cautious optimism.\n\nBeyond the economic impact, COVID-19 is likely to have a lasting impact on dental practices, both in private and public settings. Beyond the new protocols for personal protective equipment, innovations such as teledentistry are likely to remain in place. ADA Health Policy Institute data indicated that 24% of dentists in private practice had used and billed for teledentistry during the period when elective care was postponed ([American Dental Association 2020f](#ch2.ref25)). COVID-19 also is likely to accelerate other trends in dentistry, such as practice consolidation.\n\n### The Burden of Oral Disease\n\n#### Oral Health and the Economy\n\nAt the societal level, the impact of oral disease on economic activity and work participation often is underestimated or poorly understood. The annual total costs of dental disease at the global level in 2015 were estimated to be US$545.4 billion ([Righolt et al. 2018](#ch2.ref420)). Among the 21 WHO Global Burden of Disease regions, the highest levels of per capita productivity losses were found for Western Europe, Australasia, high-income North America, high-income Asia Pacific, and Central Europe. Severe tooth loss (having fewer than nine remaining natural teeth) accounted for 67% of global productivity losses because of dental diseases, followed by severe periodontitis (a Community Periodontal Index score of 4, a clinical attachment loss more than 6 millimeters [mm], or a gingival pocket depth more than 5 mm) at 21%, and untreated caries at 12% ([Marcenes et al. 2013](#ch2.ref315)).\n\n[Listl and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref256) note that poor oral health can limit both the ability to secure employment and workplace productivity. These authors point to research suggesting that the appearance of the mouth and teeth influences hiring practices and earnings ([Hamermesh and Biddle 1994](#ch2.ref205); [Harper 2000](#ch2.ref206)). For example, one study estimated that improved oral health enhanced earnings among U.S. women by 4%, with low-income women seeing the biggest effect ([Glied and Neidell 2010](#ch2.ref186)). Another analysis found that 29% of low-income adults and 60% of low-income adults living in states that did not provide dental benefits to adults in Medicaid reported that the appearance of their mouth and teeth affected their ability to interview for a job ([American Dental Association 2015a](#ch2.ref16)). Evidence from Canada indicated that improved oral health among social assistance recipients led to better job-seeking empowerment ([Singhal et al. 2015a](#ch2.ref471)).\n\nResearch also has indicated that the appearance of a person\u2019s teeth may influence what characteristics others ascribe to them, such as intelligence, honesty, or leadership potential, and could affect employability ([Henson et al. 2011](#ch2.ref219); [Pithon et al. 2014](#ch2.ref410)). Moreover, this link is strongest among low-income individuals. As [Listl and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref256) argue, \u201cwith the resulting improvements in population oral health and overall wellbeing, such measures imply substantial economic benefits not only in terms of potentially reduced treatment costs and appropriate use of healthcare resources, but also due to fewer productivity losses in the labor market and beyond.\u201d\n\nGlobally, untreated oral disease has been considered one of the 10 leading causes of years lived with disability ([Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2016](#ch2.ref236)), contributing to missed workdays and reduction in usual activity ([Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health 2012](#ch2.ref39)). Moreover, dental pain has been demonstrated to predict productivity losses ([Hayes et al. 2013](#ch2.ref207)). Overall productivity losses in the United States associated with untreated oral disease were estimated to be $45.9 billion in 2015, with the United States ranking highest among 195 countries ([Righolt et al. 2018](#ch2.ref420)). In 2008, an estimated 67.5% of adults aged 18 years or older reported lost work or school hours because of unplanned dental visits, a total of 92.4 million lost hours for nonroutine care ([Kelekar and Naavaal 2018](#ch2.ref268)). Furthermore, limited cross-sectional studies have found that parents of children who have a history of dental pain are more likely to report having missed work or school because of their child\u2019s dental problems ([Seirawan et al. 2012](#ch2.ref455); [Ribeiro et al. 2015](#ch2.ref419)).\n\nIn addition, oral health issues have an impact on academic achievement among students, in turn, influencing the choices they make in adulthood. For many years oral health professionals have often circulated \u201c51 million\u201d as a statistic to quantify the expected number of missed school hours for children because of dental problems. Indeed, this number appears in the Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health, published in 2000. Since that time, additional research has shown that U.S. children with poor oral health were more likely to have absences from school, poor grades, and self-image issues ([Pourat and Finocchio 2010](#ch2.ref414); [Seirawan et al. 2012](#ch2.ref455); [Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o and Wehby 2012a](#ch2.ref197)). For example, the odds of children with dental problems completing all required homework were 24% less than children without dental problems ([Guarnizo-Herre\u00f1o and Wehby 2012a](#ch2.ref197)). Data based on students in the Los Angeles Unified School District indicated that students with toothaches were almost four times more likely to have a low grade-point average. About 11% of students who did not have access to needed dental care missed school, compared with 4% of those with access. For every 100 elementary and high school youth, 58 and 80 school hours, respectively, were missed each year as a result of dental problems ([Seirawan et al. 2012](#ch2.ref455)). However, these reported hours also included missing school for nonurgent dental appointments.\n\nParents averaged 2.5 days absent from work or school per year because of their children\u2019s dental problems ([Seirawan et al. 2012](#ch2.ref455)). These relationships are especially prevalent among disadvantaged children. For instance, in 2007, 59% of children in California with no dental insurance missed 2 or more days of school because of dental problems, compared with 33% of children with private dental benefits and 43% with public dental benefits ([Pourat and Nicholson 2009](#ch2.ref415)). A systematic review reported an association between measures of poor oral health and poor academic performance. The authors cautioned, however, that the current evidence is of low quality (based on inconsistent methodology) and highlight the need for further research ([Ruff et al. 2019](#ch2.ref431)). Although the actual number of hours missed from school or work because of serious dental problems or oral pain may not be known, the impact to the individuals and families affected is pronounced and consequential. As explained in an earlier commentary regarding the \u201c51 million\u201d lost hours, it\u2019s not the statistic that is important, but the real people affected by the pain and discomfort from the disease that matters ([Edelstein and Reisine 2015](#ch2.ref148)).\n\n#### Medical Costs\n\nThere is strong evidence linking oral health to overall health. Numerous studies have demonstrated associations between periodontal disease and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy outcomes, and dementia, although clear causation has been difficult to establish. Setting aside possible biological relationships, health services research has shown some beneficial effects of periodontal disease treatment on overall health care costs. However, the results are mixed. Several studies have shown that when periodontal therapy is provided to members of a health plan, overall costs for all health care decrease ([Jeffcoat et al. 2014](#ch2.ref255); [Nasseh et al. 2017](#ch2.ref360); [Pihlstrom et al. 2018](#ch2.ref409)), whereas others have suggested the interpretation of findings from these types of studies needs to consider some limitations before drawing any definitive conclusions ([Sheiham 2015](#ch2.ref461); [Pihlstrom et al. 2018](#ch2.ref409)).\n\n#### Emergency Departments\n\nThe use of EDs to receive care for dental-related problems is an important concern to the U.S. health care system. For example, among all encounters at the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System ED during 2007\u20132009, 4.3% were for dental-related problems, more than half were uninsured (52%), 40% had Medicaid or Medicare, and only 8% had private health insurance ([McCormick et al. 2013](#ch2.ref327)). During this period, national statistics estimated that ED visits for dental problems accounted for at least 1% of all ED visits, with uninsured patients accounting for nearly 41% of the encounters ([Allareddy et al. 2014](#ch2.ref12)).\n\nIn 2014, there were 2.43 million ED visits for nontraumatic dental conditions (NTDC), representing more than $1.6 billion in charges; the average charge per visit was $994 for adults and $971 for children ([Kelekar and Naavaal 2019](#ch2.ref269)). NTDC ED visit rates are highest among young adults and individuals who are uninsured or have Medicaid coverage. Medicaid was the primary payer for these visits, accounting for 67% of visits by children and 36% of visits by adults ([Kelekar and Naavaal 2019](#ch2.ref269)). Analyses of national trends found that NTDC ED visits exceeded the growth rate for ED visits overall and for nondental ambulatory care-sensitive conditions ([Lee et al. 2012](#ch2.ref292); [Okunseri et al. 2012a](#ch2.ref388)). NTDC visits represent significant costs in terms of both health outcomes and health care delivery system resources.\n\nCare provided in the ED for NTDC is rarely comprehensive or curative. For instance, an estimated 90% of patients received only pain medication or antibiotics ([Okunseri et al. 2012b](#ch2.ref387); [McCormick et al. 2013](#ch2.ref327)), and most patients were referred to dental providers for treatment of underlying disease ([Lewis et al. 2003](#ch2.ref299); [Cohen et al. 2011](#ch2.ref104); [Hocker et al. 2012](#ch2.ref222)). Moreover, the majority of patients who sought dental treatment at an ED were doing so for nonurgent conditions that could have been treated at dental offices ([Wall and Vujicic 2015](#ch2.ref546)). Because ED care is primarily palliative, it is essential to link patients to a source of dental care after the ED visit. Yet, evidence suggests this does not happen routinely. For example, fewer than half of Medicaid- and CHIP-enrolled children in Florida and Texas had a follow-up visit with a dental provider within 30 days of a dental ED visit ([Herndon et al. 2017](#ch2.ref220)), and 48% of Medicaid-enrolled adults in Iowa did not have a dental visit within 6 months of a dental ED visit ([Singhal et al. 2016](#ch2.ref469)). Although dental coverage may contribute to reducing dental-related ED visits ([Cohen et al. 1996](#ch2.ref105); [Singhal et al. 2015b](#ch2.ref468); [Laniado et al. 2017](#ch2.ref289)), reduction of other barriers to accessing dental care, such as provider availability, also needs to be addressed ([Fingar et al. 2015](#ch2.ref160)). In states opting to provide dental coverage for adults through Medicaid, adults are more likely to use routine dental service ([Decker and Lipton 2015](#ch2.ref132)), have a reduced likelihood of untreated dental decay with fewer broken or missing fillings ([Decker and Lipton 2015](#ch2.ref132)), and have less periodontal disease ([Silverstein 2015](#ch2.ref465)).\n\n### Oral Health and National Security\n\nMaintaining the health status of members of the armed services is critical for ensuring an effective military force. Each branch of the armed services maintains a dental component charged with ensuring that dental conditions do not degrade military readiness. From this perspective, providing oral health care is essential for maintaining military readiness because service members are not deployable until they meet dental readiness criteria ([Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs 2002](#ch2.ref35)). When concern arose over the large percentage of dental conditions and emergencies among service members (15% per year), DoD added dental readiness as one of the six categories of military readiness in 2002 ([Lee et al. 2019](#ch2.ref295)).\n\nThe DoD dental readiness classification (DRC) system helps assess the oral health of personnel, with the following four levels of DRC for service members: 4 \u2013 Requires an annual examination because their dental readiness is unknown; 3 \u2013 Has some type of oral condition that is likely to result in a dental emergency within 1 year (these individuals are not considered to be worldwide deployable); 2 \u2013 Requires clinical preventive dental care or treatment for some type of oral condition which is unlikely to develop into a dental emergency within the next year (these individuals are considered to be worldwide deployable); and 1 \u2013 No dental treatment needed and are worldwide deployable ([Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs 2002](#ch2.ref35); [King 2008](#ch2.ref275); [Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower & Reserve Affairs 2018](#ch2.ref36)). The predictive power of this classification system is reasonably good; for example, soldiers who were DRC 3 were up to 8 times more likely to have a dental emergency during field operations or deployment than soldiers who were DRC 1 ([Chaffin and Moss 2008](#ch2.ref89)).\n\nDealing with dental injury and disease in a combat environment presents challenging logistical issues and must be properly managed to prevent loss of combat effectiveness. A RAND Corporation study of dental readiness noted the high cost in personnel time, and hence combat effectiveness, that result from dental emergencies in a combat zone ([Brauner et al. 2012](#ch2.ref62)). The authors of the RAND study reported that, \u201ca dental emergency can require three convoy vehicles with up to nine personnel for security in-theater for the sole purpose of medical evacuation\u201d ([Brauner et al. 2012](#ch2.ref62) p. 3). Estimates of expected rates of dental emergency in deployed military members vary widely, depending on pre-deployment readiness and deployment length. [Chaffin and Moss (2008)](#ch2.ref89) reported that rates between 156 and 170 dental emergencies per 1,000 deployed Army personnel should be expected. Monetary costs of dental injuries in deployed U.S. Army troops found that direct costs of dental conditions (nonbattle injury) totaled $21.9 million from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011; 32% of these injuries required additional follow-up care during a 2-year period ([Colthirst et al. 2013](#ch2.ref109)).\n\nEven in garrison, soldiers experience significant levels of dental treatment needs. The 2016 Sample Survey of Military Personnel showed that Army troops frequently experienced oral health-related difficulties that affected their daily lives ([U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences 2016](#ch2.ref505)). Dental pain affected 23.5% of enlisted soldiers in garrison, and oral problems prevented 16.5% from eating certain foods, 26% from sleeping, and 20.6% from concentrating on work, and forced 14% to miss work because of sick call or healing time in quarters ([Simecek et al. 2014](#ch2.ref466)).\n\nThe extent to which oral health affects military readiness of active-duty members varies by service branch and activity (i.e., combat, deployment, or garrison). All service branches are required to sort out the oral health status of incoming recruits and each service branch maintains its own oral health-related criteria for accepting new recruits. Poor oral health among potential recruits leads to either their disqualification for service or the need for costly dental treatment.\n\nThe U.S. Navy Dental Corps maintains dental readiness for a population of 327,577 active-duty sailors serving in the U.S. Navy and 185,830 active-duty marines serving in the U.S. Marine Corps across the world ([Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower & Reserve Affairs 2018](#ch2.ref36)). The Navy Dental Corps comprises 1,125 active-duty dentists serving on a variety of platforms, including ships, Marine Corps bases, Navy Mobile Construction Battalions, and overseas and shore facilities ([Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower & Reserve Affairs 2018](#ch2.ref36)). According to the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Navy dental clinics provide more than 1,485,000 patient visits annually. All dental care is provided free of charge.\n\nThe U.S. Army Dental Corps workforce comprises a mixture of military, government service, and contracted civilians. This workforce consists of 1,170 dentists, 263 registered hygienists, 154 prophylaxis (tooth cleaning) technicians, and 2,801 dental assistants. Dentist-to-population ratios guide workforce determinations in the Army Dental Corps. Variations in the size of the active-duty soldier population or the proportion of non-Army treatment-eligible patients who receive treatment from Army dental facilities present challenges for developing and managing an effective dental workforce. For example, during 2018, there were nearly 417,600 active-duty soldiers, but active-duty Army soldiers composed 80% of the population treated; others eligible to receive treatment included members of the National Guard and Reserve, retirees, and family members. Thus, an estimate of the average eligible population is closer to 522,000, with the estimated dentist-to-population ratio between 1:500 and 1:600. Because poor oral habits are common in this population, about one-third of soldiers are prone to developing new dental treatment needs every year; consequently, the larger cadre of oral health providers will likely be needed for some time to come ([Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018](#ch2.ref260)).\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Dental Corps consists of more than 900 active-duty general dentists and specialists, along with nearly 2,000 enlisted dental assistants, hygienists, and laboratory technicians who serve in group practices at 76 Air Force bases around the world. They provide dental care for more than 300,000 active-duty airmen and numerous additional DoD beneficiaries, totaling nearly 1.3 million dental visits annually.\n\nThe general trend toward improved oral health of U.S. adults is not fully reflected in U.S. military recruits. On average, about 17% of potential Army recruits are found to have disqualifying medical conditions upon examination, and about 44% of those identified are granted waivers for their conditions ([Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018](#ch2.ref260)). As a result, an estimated 10% of those examined are rejected for medical conditions. In 2008, the DoD Recruit Oral Health Study ([Leiendecker et al. 2011](#ch2.ref297)) found that only 25% of new recruits did not require restorative dental treatment, which was a marginal improvement from 20% in the 1994 study. Nearly 53% of 2008 Army recruits were DRC 3 and could not deploy until their conditions had been treated, an increase from 33% in 1994 and 42% in 2000. Data from 2018 revealed that out of 94,516 new recruits examined, 21,971 (23.3%) were placed in DRC 3 ([Military Health System 2019](#ch2.ref345)). To ensure that most of the new recruits were deployable, the Army has implemented a program called First Term Dental Readiness (FTDR), which attempts to treat all incoming DRC 3 conditions. The FTDR program has succeeded in meeting the 95% readiness goal set by DoD Health Affairs, with a DRC 3 prevalence of 4.66% among graduating soldiers for 2018 ([Gourley 2018](#ch2.ref189)).\n\nFewer than 1% of potential Air Force recruits are rejected because of significant dental caries or severe malocclusion. However, of those new recruits who do enter the Air Force, nearly all have some level of unmet dental treatment needs and about a quarter (23%) suffer from severe oral conditions that prevent them from deploying ([Irwin 2019a](#ch2.ref249)). In 2001, nearly half (45%) of airmen had either DRC 2 or DRC 3 oral health conditions that required treatment.\n\nToday, all branches of the service report that roughly 90% of their personnel are DRC 1 or 2, and therefore dentally ready to deploy. Managing dental problems during field training or deployments, however, remains a major focus of military dentistry. Dental problems have accounted for between 5\u201322% of all sick-call patients presenting to U.S. Army field medical treatment facilities ([Allen and Smith 1992](#ch2.ref13); [Nasser and Storz 1994](#ch2.ref361); [Dunn 2004](#ch2.ref140); [Darakjy et al. 2006](#ch2.ref126)). The top three oral conditions that affected soldiers during deployment were dental caries (including the pulpal disease caused by it), periodontal disease, and painful or infected third molars ([Simecek et al. 2014](#ch2.ref466)). [Wojcik and colleagues (2015)](#ch2.ref565) noted that incidence figures for dental disease and non-battle injuries (DNBI) for Iraq and Afghanistan operations ([Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018](#ch2.ref260)) were much higher than the DNBI rates they had previously found among admissions for other medical conditions. In the most recent systematic review of the impact of dental conditions on military readiness, [Lee and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref295) estimated that nearly 12% of all troops deployed to hostile environments will experience a dental emergency or an oral-maxillofacial injury with dental emergency rates varying by service and duty environment ([Figure 9](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig9/?report=objectonly)).\n\n#### [Figure 9](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig9/?report=objectonly)\n\nDental emergency rates by military service and environment: United States, 1966\u20132012. Notes: Means and standard deviations of dental emergency (DE) rates by service and environment. Number of DE rates reported for each environment and service: [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig9/?report=objectonly)\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 began the process of shifting responsibility for delivering the health care benefit for military beneficiaries from individual services to a single, mostly civilian-run organization, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) ([National Defense Authorization Act 2016](#ch2.ref3)). This ongoing effort cedes the management and control of all nondeployed or afloat military treatment facilities (MTF) to DHA, with the services providing much of the clinical and administrative staffing. Consolidating three service medical enterprises into one is intended to improve business practices and reduce duplication as part of DoD\u2019s effort to reform business practices. Uniformed health care providers will be loaned to DHA-managed MTFs to maintain clinical skills and for educational purposes.\n\n### Oral Health and Quality of Life\n\nGood oral health is fundamental for overall health and well-being. It contributes to effective chewing and healthy nutrition, speech, social confidence, and\u2014in the case of older adults\u2014better cognitive and functional capacity ([World Health Organization 2002](#ch2.ref569); [Petersen and Yamamoto 2005](#ch2.ref399); [Stewart et al. 2008](#ch2.ref486); [Scannapieco and Cantos 2016](#ch2.ref448)). The WHO Active Ageing Policy Framework supports the maintenance of oral health as a key piece in the overall strategy to foster active aging ([World Health Organization 2002](#ch2.ref569)).\n\nIn moving away from a disease-based focus toward a biopsychosocial model, the broader determinants of health were recognized in an updated definition for oral health adopted by the World Dental Federation in September 2016 ([Box 1](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box1/?report=objectonly)) ([Glick et al. 2016](#ch2.ref185)). This definition has implications for clinical practice and policy.\n\nDental, periodontal, and mucosal diseases typically are chronic in nature and tend to accumulate during a lifetime. Objective measures of dental disease status, such as the Decayed Missing and Filled Index ([Klein et al. 1938](#ch2.ref277)) or the International Caries Detection and Classification System ([Ismail et al. 2007](#ch2.ref250)), and such measures as periodontal probing depths ([Holtfreter et al. 2015](#ch2.ref223)) are useful for staging disease severity and planning treatment. However, these clinically derived measures fail to capture how patients experience both disease processes and treatment. It is now widely acknowledged that disease affects individuals differently. Each person\u2019s perception of well-being, pain, physical function\u2014their quality of life\u2014varies based on personal and sociocultural factors ([Baiju et al. 2017](#ch2.ref40)).\n\nAssessing quality of life is important for guiding public health interventions and for providing a foundation for patient-centered care. Quantitative measures of health-related quality of life are now in common use in descriptive population surveys and clinical intervention studies.\n\n### Oral Health Promotion and Oral Health Literacy\n\nHealth promotion is \u201cthe process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health\u201d ([World Health Organization 1986](#ch2.ref568)). Oral health promotion activities include individual behaviors, such as eating healthy foods and brushing teeth, as well as health care provider behaviors, such as adhering to prescribing guidelines and counseling patients to quit smoking. They also include public policies and programs, such as public health insurance programs, dental sealant programs, and media campaigns to discourage smoking ([Griffin et al. 2017](#ch2.ref194)) and to encourage community water fluoridation ([Horowitz 1996](#ch2.ref229)). Health promotion programs often are developed to help individuals make healthy decisions, generally through education and communication to raise awareness about healthy behaviors.\n\nHow a health promotion message is communicated will affect a person\u2019s understanding and community actions. For example, messages that use jargon or highly technical words may lessen the patient\u2019s understanding. Nine in ten adults reported having difficulty understanding basic health information ([Institute of Medicine 2004](#ch2.ref239)). This is because individuals have different levels of health literacy, which is \u201cthe degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\u201d ([Ratzan and Parker 2000](#ch2.ref417), p. vi).\n\nLow health literacy is associated with lower use of preventive care, poorer health, and higher mortality rates compared to individuals with adequate health literacy ([Berkman et al. 2011](#ch2.ref51)). The knowledge of, and ability to, understand benefits and payments associated with medical and dental insurance, also known as health insurance literacy, influences the use of dental care ([Paez et al. 2014](#ch2.ref389)).\n\nOlder adults are more likely to have low health literacy compared to younger adults ([Macek et al. 2011](#ch2.ref312)). Social determinants also have been associated with health literacy disparities ([S\u00f8rensen et al. 2012](#ch2.ref481); [Shin et al. 2013](#ch2.ref463)). Blacks, Hispanics, and people for whom English is not their first language are more likely to have low health literacy compared with White and Asian/Pacific Islander adults and with adults who are native English speakers ([Kutner et al. 2006](#ch2.ref288); [Lee et al. 2011](#ch2.ref294); [Kobayashi et al. 2015](#ch2.ref278); [Macek et al. 2017](#ch2.ref311); [Baskaradoss 2018](#ch2.ref44)).\n\nAcross populations, individuals with lower oral health literacy are more likely to have poorer oral health status ([Jamieson et al. 2013](#ch2.ref253); [Baskaradoss 2018](#ch2.ref44)) and are less likely to follow preventive oral health care recommendations ([Parker and Jamieson 2010](#ch2.ref394); [Mejia et al. 2011](#ch2.ref340)) and to miss dental appointments ([Holtzman et al. 2013](#ch2.ref224)). Whether a direct, causal relationship exists between oral health literacy and dental visits is not known, in part because low health literacy corresponds closely with other predictors of access to dental care, such as education, dental insurance, and income.\n\n### Quality of Oral Health Care\n\n#### Transformation in the Quality Landscape\n\nOver the past 20 years, many advances have been made across the public health landscape to improve the quality of programs and services. These advances have made their way to commercial and government programs focused on the development of quality measures for dentistry. Federal and state public health and delivery system programs are using quality measures to improve program performance. Such measures now are being used to drive *quality assurance*, as well as *quality improvement* processes. These steps support achievement of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement\u2019s Triple Aim for Populations by applying integrated approaches to simultaneously improve the health of populations, enhance the experience of care for individuals, and reduce the per capita cost of health care ([Berwick et al. 2008](#ch2.ref53)).\n\nThe 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health noted the lack of performance measures for assessing the oral health care delivery system. More than a decade later, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine [IOM]) issued reports focused on oral health and highlighted persistent access barriers and disparities in care. In doing so, they also brought into sharper focus the need for quality measurement and identified the lack of quality measures as a primary barrier to improving the quality of oral health care ([Institute of Medicine 2011](#ch2.ref241); [Institute of Medicine and National Research Council 2011](#ch2.ref244)). The IOM\u2019s report, *Leadership by Example: Coordinating Government Roles in Improving Health Care Quality*, noted that in \u201cproviding leadership to effect the needed changes in health care, the federal government should take full advantage of its unique position as a regulator, purchaser, health care provider, and sponsor of research, education, and training\u201d ([Institute of Medicine 2003](#ch2.ref238), p. 6). Although Medicare, as a large public program, has the ability to drive market change, it has limited influence on dentistry because dental benefits are rarely provided through Medicare. Medicaid and CHIP, on the other hand, cover close to 40% of U.S. children and thus have the market power to effect change ([Rudowitz et al. 2019](#ch2.ref430)).\n\nIn response to growing recognition of the need for dental quality measures, in 2009, the CHIP Reauthorization Act directed CMS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to convene a representative group of stakeholders to develop health care measures for dentistry. CMS petitioned ADA to take a leadership role in this effort, which triggered the formation of the Dental Quality Alliance (DQA). DQA\u2019s mission is \u201cto advance performance measurement as a means to improve oral health, patient care, and safety through a consensus-building process\u201d ([Dental Quality Alliance 2019](#ch2.ref133)).\n\nDQA has since accepted the definition of quality set forth by IOM as \u201cthe degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge\u201d ([Institute of Medicine 2001](#ch2.ref237), p. 44). This definition addresses both individuals and populations, connects care delivery to outcomes, and is grounded in the best available knowledge. Thus, quality can be assessed at different levels within the care delivery system, including the clinician/practice level, facilities (for example, hospitals), Managed Care Organizations (MCO), and public insurance and public health programs. Currently, there are three adult and a dozen pediatric DQA quality measures related to oral health (Table). AHRQ\u2019s National Quality Measures Clearinghouse has identified five clinical quality and population health measure domains: access, structure, process, outcomes, and patient/population experience ([Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2019](#ch2.ref8)). These domains form the framework for quality measurement across both the public health and health care delivery systems, including those for dentistry.\n\nGiven that dental public health and dental delivery systems operate different types of programs and services, measures and metrics developed for one type of program may not be suitable for another. In addition, measures developed for use at the plan level may not be suitable at the provider level. Several measures developed in recent years demonstrated this challenge to state program policymakers when they were tested in various dental environments ([Dental Quality Alliance 2019](#ch2.ref133)).\n\n#### Using Quality Measures to Improve Care\n\nOver the past several years, DQA, educational institutions, and MCOs have developed dental quality measures for use by Medicaid and CHIP dental programs. Such efforts have led the way toward advancing value-based programming and value-based care. In the quest for value for the dental care dollar, both CMS and state Medicaid administrators are seeking to understand whether the Medicaid system enables the delivery of quality oral health/dental health care services to program beneficiaries and improved population health management through medical-dental integration. Measures that have been developed and used by Medicaid programs during the past decade typically assess *access* and specific *utilization of preventive services*.\n\n#### [Table](/books/NBK578297/table/ch2.tab1/?report=objectonly)\n\nDental Quality Alliance (DQA) Administrative claims-based measures.\n\nThese measures help program administrators determine the degree to which program beneficiaries are receiving essential preventive dental services, whether health plans are promoting such quality services, and whether providers across their networks are centering care around primary prevention.\n\nIn 2020, CMS updated one of two oral health care measures within the Core Set of Children\u2019s Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (CMS Child Core Set): receipt of sealants on first permanent molars replaced the former measure\u2014dental sealants for children aged 6 to 9 years who are at elevated dental caries risk (SEAL-CH) ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2021a](#ch2.ref84)). The second measure\u2014percentage of eligible children who received preventive dental services (PDENT-CH)\u2014remained. While reporting of the Child Core Set measures currently is voluntary, it will become mandatory in 2024 ([Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services 2020](#ch2.ref80)).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that dental program quality measurement continues to be hampered by limited infrastructure and capacity to effectively assess oral health status and the oral health care outcomes of beneficiaries. The current dental coding system, which does not account for patient-level oral health status and dental diagnostic information, is a primary contributor to this problem. Although other more advanced dental coding systems with diagnostic codes currently exist, the shift to such data systems has not yet been implemented at the dental care delivery level.\n\nThe move to Medicaid managed care and accountable care by state Medicaid dental programs has supported quality improvement across state Medicaid programs. In 2016, 68% of Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in comprehensive care programs, including some that provided dental benefits, and 9.7% of the total Medicaid population were enrolled in limited-benefit dental prepaid ambulatory health plans, including dental-only benefit plans ([Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2021b](#ch2.ref337)). Within Medicaid managed care, a key lever for quality improvement is the requirement that states incorporate performance improvement projects (PIP) in their contracts with MCOs. A PIP is a quality improvement effort designed to address identified gaps in clinical or nonclinical aspects of care delivery, with the goal of achieving significant and sustained improvement through targeted interventions. To achieve this, MCOs must propose interventions and submit measurable objectives with metrics and adhere to strict timelines used by states to monitor performance and success. Such measures often are tied to financial incentives and disincentives. As such, the need for relevant, valid, and reliable oral health performance measures cannot be overstated.\n\nAs the current health care environment evolves, performance measures will be necessary to support plan and provider performance incentives, pay-for-performance programs, and population-based payments. The existing DQA measures provide a start. Monitoring their utility will be essential to ensure validity across all aspects of program measurement. From 2017 to 2019, CMS assisted three states under its Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program to develop models to align payment with oral health care improvement goals. Such models will align payment with oral health care improvement goals ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2019b](#ch2.ref85)).\n\nMore recently, a move has emerged to identify and work with high-risk individuals with chronic conditions to measure the value of dental care based on the degree to which dental services may advance overall health and support medical care. These patients may seek dental care while still experiencing other critical health care gaps. Integrating medical screenings into dental visits provides the opportunity to identify high-risk medical patients and link them to care or programs that support and address SDoH. Measures for these types of programs are under development in some states. They do not yet exist at the national consensus level.\n\n## Chapter 2. Advances and Challenges\n\nThe oral health status of Americans, in general, has been improving since the 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health ([Rozier et al. 2017](#ch2.ref429)). Dental caries severity in the permanent teeth of children has declined to historically low levels, and long-standing inequalities in untreated caries appear to be narrowing. Declines in caries prevalence affecting children\u2019s permanent teeth have stabilized at a low level and likely will contribute to future reductions in caries experience in adults. Although the prevalence of periodontal disease is high in adults, only a small percentage have severe forms of the disease. Tooth loss as a consequence of dental disease has declined markedly during the last half century and has been all but eliminated in high income groups.\n\nAlthough oral health is improving nationally, significant concerns persist. Dental caries, periodontal disease, and tooth loss remain significant public health concerns. As a nation, at least 4 out of 5 Americans aged 6 years and older have experienced tooth decay, irrespective of poverty or race/ethnicity status ([Figure 10](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig10/?report=objectonly)). The prevalence of dental caries increases as Americans age, and this has remained unchanged for the past 2 decades. But the overall prevalence of dental caries is starting to show a downward trend, especially among people younger than 45 years ([Figure 10](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig10/?report=objectonly)). However, most of this progress has only been realized for those living in households at 200% or higher of Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n\n#### [Figure 10](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig10/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of individuals ages 6 and older with dental caries in permanent teeth by age group, poverty status, and race/ethnicity: United States, 1988\u20131994, 1999\u20132004, 2011\u20132014. Notes: Prevalence of dental caries (DMFT > [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig10/?report=objectonly)\n\nOverall, the prevalence of untreated dental caries in permanent teeth has not changed since the release of the 2000 report, with nearly 25% of all Americans aged 6 and older affected by untreated caries ([Figure 11](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig11/?report=objectonly)). Although untreated caries has declined for children, it has increased for working-age adults during this period. The prevalence of untreated caries is higher among working-age adults compared to children, adolescents, and older adults. Untreated caries among those living in poverty remains about twice that for those not living in poverty and disparities continue to persist by race/ethnicity status. These collective experiences clearly suggest that challenges persist in preventing dental caries in permanent teeth from occurring at the population level in the United States. Advances in reducing the loss of permanent teeth because of dental disease have been substantial. In general, tooth loss has been on the decline for all Americans in recent decades ([Slade and Sanders 2017](#ch2.ref475)). When the Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health was published, people aged 6 years and older had on average six teeth missing attributable to dental disease, whereas now that has been reduced by half (from nearly six, to about three mean teeth lost) ([Figure 12](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig12/?report=objectonly)). Among all age groups, improvements in tooth loss have affected older adults the most, decreasing from about 16 missing teeth to less than 11 missing teeth. Although the decreases in mean tooth loss are also occurring across all income levels, significant differences between those living in poverty and those who do not still exist. The complete loss of teeth (edentulism) still affects 18% of adults aged 65 years or older in 2009\u20132014, with those living in poverty twice as likely to be edentulous, compared to those not living in poverty ([Dye et al. 2019](#ch2.ref145)). Additional information on advances and challenges influencing oral health status across the lifespan is provided in [Sections 2](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch3/) and [3](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch5/) of this monograph.\n\n#### [Figure 11](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig11/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of individuals ages 6 and older with untreated dental caries in permanent teeth by age group, poverty status, and race/ethnicity: United States, 1988\u20131994, 1999\u20132004, 2011\u20132014.

Notes: Mex Am = Mexican American, [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig12/?report=objectonly)\n\nImprovements in access to oral health care services have been observed steadily for the last 2 decades and have primarily helped children increase access to preventive and restorative care. State Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) have substantially facilitated the use of dental services among poor and near-poor children and adolescents ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2020b](#ch2.ref87)). A near-doubling of the percentage of children with public dental insurance from 1996 to 2015 resulted in a 15-point increase to 88% in any dental coverage among all children ([Ku et al. 2013](#ch2.ref287); [Steinmetz et al. 2014](#ch2.ref484)). For older adults aged 65 and older, modest increases in both public and private dental insurance coverage decreased the proportion uninsured from 68% to 62%, whereas the percentage of working-age adults aged 19 to 64 years with no dental insurance increased slightly from an estimated 33% to 35% ([Nasseh and Vujicic 2016a](#ch2.ref357)).\n\nProgress in expanding public coverage for youth, which has contributed to the decrease in the numbers of uninsured children, has also paralleled a considerable reduction in out-of-pocket dental expenditures for children (from mean of $155 to $100) and for adolescents (from mean of $444 to $418) between these two periods ([Figure 13](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig13/?report=objectonly)). However, with no change in dental insurance coverage for older adults, mean out-of-pocket expenses have continued to climb even after adjusting for inflation (2015 dollars) from $539 to $568. This mean out-of-pocket expenditure relationship observed for children and older adults persists for overall mean dental expenses as well. The mean reduction in total dental expenses for children was nearly $62 between these two periods ($438 to $376) whereas for older adults there was a mean increase in overall dental expenses to nearly $851 from $731, after adjusting for inflation ([Figure 14](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig14/?report=objectonly)). The ongoing lack of dental benefit/insurance coverage remains a persistent challenge and is a growing dental public health problem. Because older adults are much more dependent on a fixed income, continual increases in outof-pocket dental expenditures, along with increasing overall costs for dental care, will result in increasing deferred dental care when substantial improvements in tooth retention are occurring for an aging population that is increasing in numbers in the United States.\n\n#### [Figure 13](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig13/?report=objectonly)\n\nMean out-of-pocket dental expenditures per person in dollars (adjusted): United States, 1999\u20132004 and 2011\u20132014.

Traditionally, risk factor identification for oral diseases, such as caries or periodontal disease, focused heavily on individual-level choices and behaviors such as oral hygiene behaviors, diet, and tobacco use. It is now widely accepted that SDoH need to be considered true risk factors with causal links to oral health outcomes. Risk factors generally are considered to be exposures that are statistically and causally related to a health outcome ([Burt 2001](#ch2.ref72)). The result has been a growth in the epidemiological conceptualization of where health risk factors arise and an associated improvement in research methodology that supports the study of multilevel social determinants alongside lifestyle and biological risk factors.\n\nHow does the world around us become part of our biology? [Krieger (2001)](#ch2.ref284) provided insight into this by introducing a hierarchical, or multilevel, theory of causation. Her Ecosocial Theory provides a framework for analyzing how social factors across many levels (individual, family, community, and culture) can potentially influence health. A core concept of that theory is embodiment, \u201ca concept referring to how we literally incorporate, biologically, the material and social world in which we live, from in utero to death; a corollary is that no aspect of human biology can be understood in the absence of knowledge of history and individual and societal ways of living\u201d ([Krieger, 2005](#ch2.ref285) p. 352). Krieger described the pathways to embodiment as being structured by \u201c(a) societal arrangements of power, property, and contingent patterns of production, consumption, and reproduction, and (b) constraints and possibilities of our biology, as shaped by human evolutionary history, its ecological context, and individual histories\u2014that is, trajectories of biological and social development\u201d ([Krieger 2005](#ch2.ref285) p. 352). The implication is that each individual\u2019s pathway to embodiment will result from dynamics related to the interactions of exposure, susceptibility, and resistance.\n\nSeveral important developments emerged from this growing emphasis on social epidemiological methodologies for the study of oral health.\n\nFirst, a large empirical literature emerged documenting the extent of the role of social factors in determining the oral health of populations. It became clear that ethnic minorities, lower income and education groups, and other vulnerable communities had greater oral disease liability ([Evans and Kleinman 2000](#ch2.ref154); [Dye et al. 2007](#ch2.ref144)). These findings were consistently robust and demonstrated substantial effects on oral health. Consequently, additional efforts were made to understand the underlying mechanisms that could account for these effects. As a result, a wide variety of theoretical models and analytic frameworks have been developed for studying SDoH and the embodiment of the environment. Several of these approaches seem to have particular relevance to oral health.\n\n#### The Life Course Approach\n\nAn earlier onset and faster progression of oral diseases, including tooth decay, tooth loss, and root caries, have been seen in ethnic minorities and among those with low education ([Crimmins et al. 2009](#ch2.ref120); [Kim et al. 2012](#ch2.ref274)). Vulnerable groups tend to have poor access to routine preventive and reparative dental services and less access to fluoridated water, which can have lifelong effects on oral health and result in larger inequities among ethnic minority adults. In addition, chronic exposure to stress (for example, living in poverty) has been associated with altered physiological functioning, which may increase risk factors for oral diseases or faster progression of disease ([Crimmins et al. 2009](#ch2.ref120)). Persons of disadvantaged social status report elevated levels of stress and may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of stressors, including increased disease vulnerability for many diseases ([Williams and Jackson 2005](#ch2.ref563)).\n\n#### The Access Effect\n\nThe largest disparities in access to dental care are related to income, race, and ethnicity ([Vujicic and Nasseh 2014](#ch2.ref542); [Henshaw et al. 2018](#ch2.ref218); [Northridge et al. 2020](#ch2.ref379)). For example, low-income adults are less likely to have seen a dental provider within the past year compared to higher-income adults ([Licata and Paradise 2012](#ch2.ref302)). One in five low-income adults reported that they had not had a dental visit in 5 years or more or had never had a visit ([Licata and Paradise 2012](#ch2.ref302)). Not having regular access to dental services or an ongoing relationship with a dentist has long-term and cumulative effects on the oral health of low-income and racially diverse adults ([Wu et al. 2011](#ch2.ref574); [Zhang et al. 2019](#ch2.ref581)). Deferral of care increases the need for advanced dental services, which require payments for services that are even less affordable to these already vulnerable populations, thereby leading to even greater disparities ([Licata and Paradise 2012](#ch2.ref302)).\n\n#### Diminished Returns Theory\n\nGiven the current social structure and socioeconomic stratification, as well as existing biases in the labor market and education system, the same economic resources may generate larger health gains for White Americans than for individuals belonging to ethnic minorities ([Assari 2018](#ch2.ref34)). This means that the protective effects of higher socioeconomic status are less for racial and ethnic minority groups than for Whites ([Assari 2018](#ch2.ref34)). This could be the result of a reduced effect of education on employment and income. Conscious and unconscious bias also plays a role in employment, even among employees with the same education level, and leads to an increased chance of discrepancy in salary. Such structural and institutional-level barriers can result in health disparities ([Assari 2018](#ch2.ref34)).\n\n#### Culture/Acculturation Effect\n\nCultural factors play a significant role in oral health inequalities and lead to disparities. Living in a multicultural environment can affect the attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge of persons who are different from the mainstream population ([Tiwari and Albino 2017](#ch2.ref497)).\n\nThe challenges of acculturating to the mainstream population can lead to distance from former sources of social support and cause emotional distress, which are linked to lower use of health services and poor oral health outcomes ([Tiwari and Albino 2017](#ch2.ref497)). However, high acculturation is associated with higher education, preference for the English language, and social networks that potentially lead to greater utilization of dental services ([Maupome et al. 2016](#ch2.ref324); [Macy et al. 2018](#ch2.ref313)).\n\n#### Commercial Determinants Affecting Oral Health\n\nAnother important change in the past 2 decades is improved understanding of the conditions that lead to poor oral health, including the need that much greater attention should be paid to social and economic organization and the role of markets and industry as risk factors. Some commercial influences contribute to the persistent prevalence of oral disease. Population-level interventions are needed to address commercial determinants of oral health, income inequalities, health literacy, unhealthy eating habits, and more. For example, excise taxes on sugary beverages and other policy approaches to reduce sugar consumption have been associated with a reduction in new dental caries and lower dental treatment costs ([Schwendicke et al. 2016](#ch2.ref454)), but these approaches remain underutilized as methods for shaping consumption and improving health and social outcomes ([von Philipsborn et al. 2019](#ch2.ref537)).\n\nReducing two of the major risk factors for oral health\u2014tobacco and excess alcohol consumption\u2014remains a challenge for policymakers. In 2019, nearly 50.6 million U.S. adults used a tobacco product (34.1 million currently smoke) ([Cornelius et al. 2020](#ch2.ref117)), and about 4.47 million middle and high school students used at least one tobacco product, including e-cigarettes ([Cornelius et al. 2020](#ch2.ref117); [Gentzke et al. 2020](#ch2.ref180)). Every day in the United States, about 1,600 young people under the age of 18 years smoke their first cigarette ([Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2019](#ch2.ref488)). Moreover, e-cigarette use by adolescents and young adults increased at an alarming rate between 2018 and 2019 ([Cullen et al. 2019](#ch2.ref121); [Wang et al. 2019](#ch2.ref548)), although it declined in 2020 ([Gentzke et al. 2020](#ch2.ref180)). Alcohol use remains a challenge; in 2015, 66.7 million people in the United States reported binge drinking in the past month ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2016a](#ch2.ref522)). Additional information on tobacco and alcohol use is discussed in [Section 5](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch8/).\n\n### Vulnerable Populations and Oral Health Disparities/Inequities\n\n#### Rural Populations\n\nAlthough the 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health noted the gravity of rural oral health disparities, its conclusion was limited by lack of sufficient data. Since then, the health outcomes of rural populations have been prioritized. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) released reports on oral health in rural communities in 2004 and 2018 ([Barnett et al. 2018](#ch2.ref43)). These reports identified agency priorities for improving rural oral health, most notably provider recruitment and training, oral health literacy and education, and medical-dental integration. In 2013, the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy funded the development of a publicly available Rural Oral Health Toolkit to disseminate successful rural oral health care delivery models ([NORC Walsh Center for Rural Health Analysis et al. 2013](#ch2.ref376)).\n\nGeographic and socioeconomic factors continue to create rural oral health disparities. More than half of all uninsured rural adults live in states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, thus restricting their access to insurance coverage ([Foutz et al. 2017](#ch2.ref166)). Variations in Medicaid coverage for dental procedures also affect rural providers and patients more dramatically than those in urban settings ([Fish-Parcham et al. 2019](#ch2.ref162)). Recruitment of dentists to rural areas is an ongoing challenge, with the vast majority of dental school graduates\u2014even those originally from rural areas\u2014choosing to practice in more urban locations ([Vujicic et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref543)). Because rural dentists are, in general, older than the average practicing dentist, the sustainability of the rural dental workforce may be increasingly under threat in the coming decades ([Doescher et al. 2009](#ch2.ref137)).\n\nOne of the largest innovations since 2000 with the potential to have an impact on rural residents has been the adoption of dental therapy in the United States to address ongoing rural dental workforce challenges. Dental therapists are members of a dental team who provide preventive and restorative dental care. Although dental therapists have practiced globally in rural areas since the early 20th century, it was only in 2003 that the first cohort of dental therapists began to treat Alaska Natives as part of the Indian Health Service\u2019s (IHS) Community Health Aide Program. In 2009, Minnesota became the first state to pass legislation permitting dental therapists to practice statewide, with subsequent adoption by the predominantly rural states of Vermont and Maine ([Koppelman et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref282)). As of 2019, eight states had passed dental therapy legislation that allows these professionals to practice independently ([Grant 2019](#ch2.ref191)) and 12 states allowed dental therapy in some capacity. Research indicates that dental outcomes were equivalent or superior when dental teams included therapists ([Wright et al. 2013](#ch2.ref572)). In spite of these advances, there are only about 100 dental therapists practicing across the country ([Koppelman et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref282)). See [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/) for more information on dental therapists.\n\nScalability of effective oral health prevention interventions in rural areas is a special challenge. Water fluoridation in small, rural communities is costlier than in cities; however, the estimated return on investment for community water fluoridation in communities of fewer than 5,000 people still approaches $30 per person ([Griffin et al. 2001](#ch2.ref193); [O\u2019Connell et al. 2016](#ch2.ref383)). Higher use of well water rather than community water sources further complicates efforts to provide this important preventive measure. Yet, prevention is especially important in rural areas because many patients face long travel times to reach a dentist in rural dental health professional shortage areas. Limited transportation options, especially for older rural dwellers, may further restrict access ([Arcury et al. 2005](#ch2.ref31)).\n\n#### Low-Income Populations\n\nThe 2000 report on oral health highlighted the disproportionate burden of dental caries borne by people living in poverty. Overall, income and economic status disparities in oral health persist. Cost continues to be the greatest barrier to accessing dental care. Dental cost as a percentage of total income is a metric that highlights how low-income families often are unable to access professional dental services. [Halasa-Rappel and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref204) analyzed 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data and reported two associated and troubling findings. Among individuals living in poverty, 93% had unmet dental care needs, compared to 58% of those in the high-income group. They also reported that as a percentage of income, individuals living in poverty spend nearly 10 times more of their income for dental care, compared to high-income families ([Halasa-Rappel et al. 2019](#ch2.ref204)).\n\nPublic health interventions intended to reduce disparities can inadvertently worsen them; however, working with community partners can improve implementation practices that can increase the likelihood of success and improved health outcomes of community participants. For example, population level interventions that depend on voluntary behavior change typically are adopted by the most advantaged. As health technologies advance, such as in the field of precision dentistry, economically advantaged groups are likely to benefit most from these potentially costly services, resulting in a widening of income disparities in oral health. For example, as technologies have improved treatment outcomes over the past 2 decades, increases in tooth retention have led to more affluent adults having more natural teeth retained compared to those living in poverty, but observed disparities in tooth retention by income status increased ([Dye et al. 2019](#ch2.ref145)).\n\nDecreasing health disparities depends in large part on programs and policies aimed at providing more equitable distribution of evidence-based, health-promoting interventions. Generally, this means programs that are not dependent on individual behavior change or compliance, such as community water fluoridation programs. Increasing the proportion of the population served by community water fluoridation not only benefits the entire population but disproportionally benefits economically vulnerable groups, producing a flatter socioeconomic gradient in dental caries among children ([Slade et al. 1995](#ch2.ref473); [Riley et al. 1999](#ch2.ref422); [McLaren and Emery 2012](#ch2.ref330); [McLaren et al. 2016](#ch2.ref331)) and reducing the need for expensive dental treatment.\n\nTo redress such inequities, the federal Healthy People 2000 initiative introduced an overarching goal to reduce health disparities. Healthy People 2010 expanded this goal based on characteristics of race and ethnicity, geographic location, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, educational attainment, and family income. Healthy People 2020 retained elimination of health disparities as an overarching goal and added achieving health equity and improving the health of al groups. This has been further expanded for Healthy People 2030, where an overarching goal is to eliminate health disparities, achieve health equity, and attain health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2020b](#ch2.ref519)).\n\n#### Black or African American Populations\n\nThe gaps between the status of non-Hispanic Black populations relative to other racial groups remain similar to those reported in the 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health. A comparison of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999\u20132004 and 2011\u20132014 revealed that the racial disparities between non-Hispanic Black and White school-age children for untreated dental caries have broadly not improved but when race and poverty are both considered, the disparities for low-income non-Hispanic Blacks aged 6\u201311 become more pronounced but are nearly eliminated among more affluent youth ([Dye et al. 2017](#ch2.ref143)). Non-Hispanic Black populations in the United States continue to experience greater morbidity from oral diseases than their counterparts of other racial groups ([Henshaw et al. 2018](#ch2.ref218)). For low-income Blacks in the United States, the challenges of having adequate dental benefits and access to a workforce that is willing and available to meet their oral health needs is an ongoing challenge. That only 3.3% of U.S. dentists are Black is an important aspect to this challenge ([Mertz et al. 2017](#ch2.ref341)).\n\nAs the number of older adults in the United States increases, it is important to note that there are persistent disparities between Black and White older adults, especially with regard to untreated dental caries ([Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019](#ch2.ref82)). Continuing barriers to receiving needed dental care services for older adults include lack of dental coverage in Medicare and limited access to adult dental benefits through Medicaid ([Friedman et al. 2014a](#ch2.ref170)). Because many individuals lose their employment-based dental insurance upon retirement, [Manski and colleagues (2011)](#ch2.ref314) estimated that non-Hispanic Black retirees were three times more likely to stop using dental services than were their White counterparts, even after controlling for other factors, such as income and education.\n\nEffective promotion of oral health among non-Hispanic Blacks also requires an improved understanding of how social determinants function to influence oral health and access to care across cultures. Although living in poverty and disadvantaged neighborhoods, and having more exposure to chronic stressors ([Sanders and Spencer 2004](#ch2.ref443); [Turrell et al. 2007](#ch2.ref504); [Finlayson et al. 2010](#ch2.ref161); [Braveman et al. 2011](#ch2.ref64)), can affect anyone living with those hardships, the interaction of these factors with race remains unclear. For example, among child populations where Medicaid and CHIP are available, the percentage of those who were uninsured varied in important ways across racial and ethnic groups. Among the insured, moreover, substantial differences exist between public and private insurance coverage. Among Black children, 49.1% had public insurance and 42.8% had private insurance, whereas for White children, 17.5% had public insurance and 76.2% had private insurance. Children with public insurance receive less dental care than those with private dental coverage. This often is attributed to lower reimbursement rates by Medicaid in most states, leading to a smaller number of dentists willing to provide services to Medicaid patients ([Flores and Tomany-Korman 2008](#ch2.ref164)). These factors limit access to and utilization of regular dental services, especially preventive services ([Edelstein and Chinn 2009](#ch2.ref147); [Pourat and Finocchio 2010](#ch2.ref414)). As a result, there are continuing disparities in access to important preventive services, such as dental sealants, between Black and White children ([Figure 15](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig15/?report=objectonly)) ([Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019](#ch2.ref82)).\n\n#### [Figure 15](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig15/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of youth ages 6\u201319 with dental sealants by age group, poverty status, and race/ethnicity; United States, 2011\u20132016. Note: *FPG* = Federal Poverty Guideline: < 100% FPG = poor; 100\u2013199% FPG = near poor; and \u2265 [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig15/?report=objectonly)\n\n#### Hispanic Populations\n\nHispanic Americans, especially those of lower socioeconomic status, continue to experience a high burden of oral disease and challenges with low dental utilization and access to culturally competent dental care. Based on National Health Interview Survey data, the proportion of Hispanic children without dental visits in the past year declined between 2000 and 2014 ([Larson et al. 2016](#ch2.ref290)). However, dental coverage is more variable for adults than for children and dental care continues to pose a significant cost for many adults who report more financial barriers to obtaining dental services than other types of health services ([Vujicic et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref541)).\n\nStatistics from more current NHANES cycles revealed that young Hispanic children (aged 2\u20138 years) had higher prevalence of untreated decay in primary teeth and greater dental caries experience compared to other racial and ethnic groups ([Satcher and Nottingham 2017](#ch2.ref446)). An important advancement since 2000 has been the development of more recent national data available for Hispanic adults aged 18 to 74 years for 2008\u20132011 ([Beck et al. 2014](#ch2.ref47)). These data allow reporting on oral health status for different Hispanic subgroups, unavailable since the 1982\u20131984 Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included Mexican Americans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans ([Ismail and Szpunar 1990](#ch2.ref251)). Baseline data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) provide a new national dataset that can support exploring diversity across Hispanic population groups in an attempt to better understand the connection between oral health and other diseases. For example, among all ethnic Hispanic subgroups, half have some form of periodontitis (mild, moderate, or severe), but more than a third of Cubans and Central Americans have the highest prevalence of moderate periodontitis among all subgroups ([Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2014](#ch2.ref258)). The HCHS/SOL enables accounting for traditional oral health risk factors, as well as other important cultural factors.\n\nAcculturation, education, language barriers, transportation deficiencies, ethnic identity, and lack of dental insurance remain significant factors affecting dental utilization among Hispanic adults ([Stewart et al. 2002](#ch2.ref485); [Eke et al. 2011](#ch2.ref149); [Strouse et al. 2013](#ch2.ref487); [Velez et al. 2017](#ch2.ref536); [Silveira et al. 2020](#ch2.ref464)). In addition, the lack of an ongoing relationship with a dentist, lack of available transportation, and difficulty getting time off from work for dental visits are more common barriers among Hispanic communities ([Kim et al. 2012](#ch2.ref274); [Vujicic and Nasseh 2014](#ch2.ref542)). Hispanic dentists remain largely underrepresented among dentists nationwide and, like other minority dentists, Hispanic dentists tend to practice in communities with a large proportion of minorities ([Mertz et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref343)).\n\n#### American Indian and Alaska Native Populations\n\nIn 2010, IHS implemented an ongoing oral health surveillance system designed to monitor trends in oral health among the American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population served by IHS and tribal programs. Since the implementation of the surveillance program, oral health data have been obtained from four different age groups: preschool children (2010, 2014, and 2018\u20132019), elementary school children (2011\u20132012 and 2016\u20132017), adolescents (2012\u20132013), and adults (2015). The IHS Oral Health Surveillance Plan provides detailed information regarding past, present, and future-planned oral health surveys of the AI/AN communities ([Indian Health Service 2015](#ch2.ref232)).\n\nThe IHS Division of Oral Health has conducted seven surveys since the launch of the original oral health surveillance plan in 2010 ([Indian Health Service 2021a](#ch2.ref233)). Each survey used the Basic Screening Survey instrument ([Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors 2021](#ch2.ref37)) as the tool to conduct community-based, clinic-based, and school-based surveys. Survey results are available as IHS Data Briefs on the IHS Division of Oral Health website ([Indian Health Service 2021b](#ch2.ref234)). However, despite the fact that more recent data from the IHS surveillance system appear to be showing improvements in the oral health of some AI/AN preschool children ([Figures 16](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig16/?report=objectonly) and [17](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig17/?report=objectonly)), these children continue to suffer disproportionately from common oral diseases ([Phipps et al. 2019](#ch2.ref408)).\n\n#### [Figure 16](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig16/?report=objectonly)\n\nChange in percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children ages 1\u20135 with early childhood caries (ECC) by select Indian Health Service areas between 2010 and 2018\u20132019.\n\n#### [Figure 17](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig17/?report=objectonly)\n\nPercentage of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN] children ages 1\u20135 with early childhood caries (ECC] and untreated dental caries in 2010, 2014, and 2018\u20132019. Note: Information surveyed from 53 IHS service units.\n\nThe relative geographic isolation of many tribal populations may limit access to dental care. AI/AN patients also face difficulties in receiving routine and preventive dental care as a result of other reasons, such as the chronic shortage of dentists within IHS ([Batliner 2016](#ch2.ref46)). The IHS struggles to attract physicians and dentists to rural and geographically isolated locations. The dentist-to-population ratio exceeds 1:5,000 in AI/AN communities ([Mertz et al. 2017](#ch2.ref341)), compared to an average of 1:1,600 for the entire U.S. population ([Munson and Vujicic 2018](#ch2.ref353)). In addition, dental services provided through IHS often are underfunded, resulting in a need to concentrate on providing basic emergency care services, with restorative and preventive care provided primarily to children. As a result, availability of adult restorative care may be compromised ([Soeng and Chinitz 2010](#ch2.ref478)).\n\n#### Sexual and Gender Minorities\n\nSexual and gender minority populations (SGM) likely constitute groups at higher risk for oral diseases and oral health inequities by virtue of their lower access to care and lower levels of social influence ([Schwartz et al. 2019](#ch2.ref452)). The National Institutes of Health established an SGM Research Office to expand the knowledge base related to SGM health and well-being and to advance SGM-related research ([National Institutes of Health 2020](#ch2.ref369)). However, to date, research related to the oral health of this group is extremely limited. In the 2000 Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health, attention was drawn to the lack of information on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other populations. Little has changed in the intervening 2 decades. The only current report is from [Schwartz and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref452), which noted that \u201csubjective measures of oral health were worse among gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults versus heterosexual adults\u201d ([Schwartz et al. 2019](#ch2.ref452), p. 18).\n\n### Oral Health for those with Special Health Care Needs\n\nAlthough access to dental care services and achieving and maintaining good oral health is a challenge for many people, this is especially the case for individuals with disabilities and complex medical conditions ([Institute of Medicine and National Research Council 2011](#ch2.ref244)). In the past 20 years, the population of individuals with special health care needs (SHCN) has increased at the same time that many more are residing in community living arrangements. One in five children have SHCNs ([Chi 2018a](#ch2.ref97)). [Lewis (2009)](#ch2.ref300) responding to the 2000 report on oral health, reported that dental care was the most frequently cited health care need among children with SHCNs. As a result, dentists are increasingly called upon to provide dental care services in their offices for people with complex conditions. This often requires close consultation and collaboration with others on the patient\u2019s health care team. It also may present challenges for dental professionals without the in-depth training required to care for the wide variety of physical, medical, and cognitive conditions that these patients present. Currently, the population with the highest per-visit expenditures in dental offices is the elderly population. This also is the group most likely to have disabilities and complex health care conditions ([Wall et al. 2013](#ch2.ref545)). See [Sections 2A](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch3/) and [3B](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch6/) for more information on these special needs populations.\n\nTraining of oral health providers in providing clinical dental services for patients with complex health conditions remains distressingly inadequate ([Furlini et al. 2018](#ch2.ref172)) and accreditation requirements for predoctoral dental education programs require that graduates only be competent to assess the needs of individuals with special needs ([Commission on Dental Accreditation 2018](#ch2.ref110)). Unfortunately, the number of people with special needs or complex health conditions continues to grow in absolute terms and as a percentage of the population ([Institute of Medicine 2007](#ch2.ref240); [Okoro et al. 2018](#ch2.ref386); [Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative 2020](#ch2.ref99)). Moreover, those with the most complex conditions are more likely to be isolated in facilities providing specialized health care. Finally, payment systems typically do not recognize complexity and as a result, dental care is still paid through one-size-fits-all reimbursement mechanisms (set procedure or visit fees with no modifiers). Understandably, all these factors disincentivize dentists and worsen the disparities experienced by many individuals living with complex health conditions.\n\n### Social Determinants and Health Policy\n\nMany oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease, share common risk factors with other chronic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. These risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use and an unhealthy diet. Increasing awareness of the presence of common risk factors across multiple chronic diseases could help to coalesce powerful health advocacy groups. Combining the voices speaking for both oral diseases and related chronic diseases would provide a stronger lever for advancing health promotion messages and for advocating for health policy change ([Watt and Sheiham 2012](#ch2.ref556)).\n\nThe realization that oral health fits into a broader health agenda already has enabled changes in health promotion and service delivery. It now is seen as appropriate for oral health advocates to focus on high-level policy changes, such as those aimed at reducing consumption of foods and beverages with added sugars ([Navia 1994](#ch2.ref372)). Moving oral health promotion and service delivery to new venues, such as medical offices, schools, and community services sites, also has been stimulated by these changes.\n\nHealth-related policy and social marketing aimed at social and commercial determinants have had an impact on population-level health behaviors. In terms of dietary risk factors, added sugar intake decreased for both men and women across all age groups between 2001\u20132004 and 2007\u20132010 ([Millen et al. 2016](#ch2.ref346)). Nonetheless, most Americans continue to exceed the U.S. Dietary Guidelines\u2019 recommendation to limit added sugar intake to less than 10% of calories per day ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2016b](#ch2.ref523)).\n\nUse of conventional, or combustible cigarettes has declined during the past several decades among all age groups including youth and young adults in the United States ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2014](#ch2.ref521)). Although federal restrictions on where smoking can occur have not been enacted, many state and community laws prohibit smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and bars. Nevertheless, 39% of the U.S. population remains uncovered by comprehensive smokefree indoor air policies ([American Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights Foundation 2021](#ch2.ref28)). Rising state excise taxes on cigarette sales also have reduced per capita consumption of cigarettes.\n\nSince the first Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking and health in 1964, there have been 34 different reports related to tobacco use, including the most recent report in 2020 on smoking cessation. A 2012 Cochrane Collaboration systematic review on interventions for tobacco cessation in the dental setting suggested that behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation conducted by oral health professionals and incorporating an oral examination component in the dental office or community setting may increase tobacco abstinence rates both among people who smoke cigarettes and those who use smokeless tobacco ([Carr and Ebbert 2012](#ch2.ref77)).\n\nUnderstanding of policy approaches for reducing tobacco use, alcohol misuse, and added sugar consumption has greatly improved. Excise taxes, which raise the price of taxed products, are highly effective in reducing consumption of tobacco products, alcohol, and sugary beverages ([Bloomberg et al. 2019](#ch2.ref55)). Their impact tends to be stronger among the less affluent and youth, suggesting that these groups would receive the greatest health benefits. Increasing taxes on these three products should not only improve health and reduce costs but also improve market efficiency. Such taxes are justified by the large and growing health and economic costs they impose on users, such as smoking-related illnesses or alcohol-related automobile accidents, as well as economic arguments regarding fiscal efficiency.\n\nThe introduction of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine also is critical because it will provide some protection against oropharyngeal and other cancers ([Chaturvedi et al. 2008](#ch2.ref92); [Chaturvedi et al. 2011](#ch2.ref93)). Although the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers has decreased, this has not been the case for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Thus, the HPV vaccine has the potential to be a key public health intervention and may have an equity effect among men and women if HPV vaccination programs can be provided in a broad-based manner similar to other mandatory vaccines. According to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, rates of HPV vaccine initiation are higher among adolescents living in poverty than among higher-income groups ([Bednarczyk et al. 2013](#ch2.ref48)). More information on HPV and oral health is found in [Sections 2B](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch4/) and [3A](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch5/).\n\nThe federal Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are broader policy developments that redistribute income to low-income families with children. Along with rises in the minimum wage, these policies may alleviate the magnitude of income-related inequalities in oral health. In this way, contemporary understanding of what determines health\u2014namely that structural factors play a stronger role than individual factors\u2014is a fundamental change in the current policy and health research environment that should not be ignored. It also is an area where evidence of the effects of interventions is developing ([Waters et al. 2008](#ch2.ref554); [Bambra et al. 2009](#ch2.ref42); [Cochrane Public Health 2015](#ch2.ref103)).\n\n#### The Food and Beverage Industry\n\nPolicy and population-level initiatives are being employed to begin to address commercial determinants of poor oral health. Cost is a powerful tool to modify behavior. For example, states impose different levels of excise tax on the sale of cigarettes and their impact on consumption is well established. Whether these efforts affect smoking-related diseases is less clear. [Sanders and Slade (2013)](#ch2.ref436) examined state cigarette excise tax and its associations with per capita consumption, exposure to secondhand smoke, and chronic periodontitis in U.S. nonsmokers. They found that for each additional 10 cents in excise tax, cigarette sales would decrease by 0.74 packs per person per month and the adjusted odds of moderate or severe periodontitis by 22%. These authors found that the odds of periodontitis for those exposed to secondhand smoke were elevated, suggesting that a cigarette excise tax also could protect nonsmokers against periodontitis.\n\nMore recently, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages have been implemented in a number of countries and localities, yet no analysis has been published about their effect on dental caries ([Schwendicke et al. 2016](#ch2.ref454)). Nevertheless, simulation studies suggest that such a tax could reduce tooth decay and its associated economic burdens and that improvements would be most concentrated in younger age groups ([Sowa et al. 2018](#ch2.ref482); [Jevdjevic et al. 2019](#ch2.ref256))\n\n### Financing Dental Care\n\nDental spending has increased substantially in the past 2 decades. Much of this increase comes from increased access to public programs, in particular Medicaid, with smaller shares coming from private dental insurance and out-of-pocket spending. For example, in 2018, 10% of national dental spending was financed by public programs, and 40% was paid out of pocket by patients. Another 46% was financed by private dental insurance (See [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/), [Figure 3](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/figure/ch7.fig3/?report=objectonly)). In 2000, only 4% was financed by public programs, 44% through out-of-pocket payments, and 50% from private dental insurance. The shifts in the mix of dental care financing have been occurring gradually, driven largely by changes in dental care utilization patterns ([Vujicic 2015b](#ch2.ref539); [American Dental Association 2020g](#ch2.ref26)).\n\nAmong adults 65 years and older, retirement often brings a loss of employment-based medical and dental insurance. After reaching age 65, older adults typically transition from employment-based medical insurance to Medicare. Because Medicare includes only limited coverage for dental care, an estimated 1 in 3 older adults have any dental insurance with the majority having some private dental insurance and a few enrolled in Medicaid ([Nasseh and Vujicic 2016a](#ch2.ref357); [Yarbrough and Vujicic 2019](#ch2.ref578)). Consequently, older adults relying on Medicare for health insurance incur substantial out-of-pocket expenses for dental services. More than 40% of dental expenses are paid out of pocket, compared to only 9% of medical expenses for Medicare-enrolled older adults ([Kreider et al. 2015](#ch2.ref283)). As a result, many adults fail to receive needed dental care. Fewer than half of Medicare beneficiaries (49%) had a dental visit within the past 12 months. For some ethnic groups, utilization rates for Medicare beneficiaries were even lower. Only 29% of Blacks and 35% of Hispanics aged 65 years and older had a dental visit in the past 12 months. Other older adult groups also had low utilization rates\u2014only 30% of low-income and 41% of rural residents sought dental care in the previous 12 months. This is particularly concerning because older adults are at higher risk for periodontal disease and oral cancer, both of which have a worse prognosis if diagnosis and treatment are delayed ([Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2020](#ch2.ref335)).\n\nCurrent public insurance programs are struggling to provide coverage for many. This is primarily attributable to the expanding number of Americans eligible for public assistance. These numbers are growing, and states are challenged to keep up with the demand. Although federal law restricts routine dental care for Medicare beneficiaries, many Medicare enrollees more recently have begun to access preventive dental services under Medicare Advantage (MA) programs. These programs offer seniors dental services as incentives to plan selection ([Freed 2021](#ch2.ref167)). In most MA plans, dental care is limited to preventive and simple restorative services.\n\n#### Public Dental Insurance\n\nUse of dental care services across population groups has steadily increased since 2000. Among Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, children enrolled in the Early and Periodic, Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment program under Medicaid or CHIP were reported to have increased utilization of any dental service from 6.3 million in fiscal year (FY) 2000 to 19.6 million in FY 2019 ([Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2021b](#ch2.ref88)). Population growth and changing demographics across the United States have driven changes in Medicaid program policy, administration, and eligibility across states and have accounted for much of this increase. Medicaid expansion implemented in many states as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to steady increases in both pediatric and adult Medicaid enrollment since 2010. Similar enrollment increases have been observed across states with CHIP. Between 2013 and 2018, nonexpansion states observed only a 10.2% increase in Medicaid enrollment, compared to a 35.9% increase in expansion states during the same period ([Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2020](#ch2.ref335)).\n\nSince 2010, many states have combined their CHIP and Medicaid programs. This shift in program administration provides greater access to a wider range of dental benefits because Medicaid policy is less restrictive than CHIP. In 2017, only 13 states operated a separate CHIP program, compared to nearly all states in 2000 ([Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2017](#ch2.ref334)). Increased enrollment of children in Medicaid can improve access to care and reduce untreated disease. However, the structure of dental coverage for children in the ACA has presented new challenges for implementation. These structural barriers include complex benefit designs, lack of affordability protections in some plans, and no mandate to purchase dental coverage ([Snyder et al. 2014](#ch2.ref476)). The ACA does not require dental insurance for adults and the result has been negligible improvement in dental coverage among working-age adults. Nearly 2.5 times as many adults have medical insurance, compared to dental insurance ([Kreider et al. 2015](#ch2.ref283)).\n\nFor adults, dental benefits are not mandated under federal law, although many state Medicaid agencies have expanded dental policies and benefits during the past 2 decades. This increase in access to dental care came about because of increases in enrollment through Medicaid expansion and the advancement of Medicaid dental policy for adults ([Medicaid/Medicare/CHIP Services Dental Association 2019a](#ch2.ref338); [2019b](#ch2.ref339)). Current status of dental Medicaid benefit expansion is shown in [Figure 18](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig18/?report=objectonly). In 2017, more than half of state Medicaid dental programs reported including preventive and restorative oral health care services for adults: comprehensive oral examination (33 states), dental cleaning (33 states), and amalgam and composite fillings (32 and 31 states, respectively). Thirty states covered upper and lower dentures, 24 states covered root canal treatment for adults, and 31 states covered scaling and root planing and scaling services for pregnant women 21 years and older ([Medicaid/Medicare/CHIP Services Dental Association 2019a](#ch2.ref338)).\n\n#### [Figure 18](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig18/?report=objectonly)\n\nStatus of Medicaid expansion decisions by state: United States, 2020. Notes: Current status for each state is based on Kaiser Family Foundation tracking and analysis of state activity. \u25ca Expansion is adopted but not yet implemented in MO and OK. [(more...)](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig18/?report=objectonly)\n\nAlthough the national average is 38% of dentists participating in Medicaid or CHIP to provide services for children, there is considerable variation across states. For example, the participation rate in Iowa is 85.5%, with greater than 70% participation in Alabama, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, and Vermont. On the low end, with participation rates below 16%, were California, Maine, and New Hampshire. Factors that are associated with participation include dental provider gender and age, with participating providers more likely to be younger or female ([American Dental Association 2020h](#ch2.ref26)). However, other factors, such as state poverty level, the number of health professional shortage areas within a state, and a state\u2019s decision to not participate in the Medicaid expansion of the ACA, are associated with lower rates of dentist participation in Medicaid and CHIP ([American Dental Association 2020g](#ch2.ref26)).\n\nStill, there has been much improvement with regard to dental providers enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP since the early 2000s. According to the most recent data, 38% of general and pediatric dentists participate as Medicaid or CHIP providers. It is important to note that simple participation rates do not fully measure the availability of dental services for the Medicaid beneficiaries because they do not include billing rates or patients treated ([Warder and Edelstein 2017](#ch2.ref550)).\n\n### Other Governmental Activities Supporting the Dental Health Care System\n\nOver the past 2 decades, HRSA, in collaboration with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has continued to support and expand dental care access for low-income Americans. The HRSA Health Center Program (HCP) has supported health centers with Section 330 grant funding, whereas CMS and state Medicaid agencies cover fees associated with the delivery of health care services ([110th United States Congress 2008](#ch2.ref1)). In 2011, CMS established a federal regulation allowing Federally Qualified Health Centers to contract with private dental offices for the delivery of dental care services. In so doing, a new pathway was cleared in which health center dental program infrastructure and capacity could expand so that patients could more easily access dental care services in their communities. As a result of this regulation, many health centers across the United States have been able to significantly increase their capacity to meet the dental needs of their patients.\n\nNearly 93% of HRSA\u2019s Health Center Program grantees provide preventive dental services either onsite or by paid referral. Between 2001 and 2020, HRSA-funded health centers increased the number of dental visits from 3.2 million to more than 11.3 million and the number of dental patients from 1.4 million to nearly 5.2 million ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2021b](#ch2.ref208)). In FY 2016, 420 health center program grantees received nearly $156 million to expand oral health services as part of the FY 2016 Oral Health Service Expansion awards ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2016](#ch2.ref209)).\n\nMore recently, in 2019 HRSA awarded more than $85 million to 298 health centers to expand their oral health service capacity through new infrastructure enhancements ([Health Resources and Services Administration 2019b](#ch2.ref213)). These investments are the first by HRSA to focus solely on oral health infrastructure and will enable HRSA-funded health centers to provide new, or enhance existing, oral health services.\n\n### Provision of Oral Health Care in Nontraditional Settings\n\nFragmented care delivery continues to characterize much of the U.S. health care system. The resulting lack of access to care for many, as well as poor coordination among health care providers, exacerbates poor health outcomes and contributes to health disparities ([Wasserman et al. 2019](#ch2.ref553)). Moreover, dental delivery systems and regulatory environments still emphasize and provide disproportional support for surgical interventions provided in high-cost surgical suites ([Suga et al. 2014](#ch2.ref490)). One result is that the understanding and adoption of evidence-based prevention and conservative management approaches to dental caries management have been slow over the last 2 decades. This lag in adopting or advocating for effective but minimally invasive prevention interventions, such as silver diamine fluoride or fluoride varnish, limits the provision of dental services in nontraditional settings (care provided outside a traditional dental office) by public health dental hygienists, dental therapists, or others who may be more available than dentists.\n\nCare delivery outside of traditional dental care facilities continues to be problematic. The need for adequate equipment, such as a dental operatory and patient safeguards such as infection control and privacy, often creates financial and logistical barriers to providing care for some patients. The most important population in this regard is the institutionalized elderly or disabled, who often have limited or no mobility and may have significant oral health treatment needs. Although regular dental care delivered onsite would be possible for many, few long-term care facilities currently provide such care. In states where dental practice regulations permit care delivery by dental hygienists or other expanded-function professionals, some opportunity exists for onsite care.\n\n#### Supply of Dental Services\n\nIn the past 20 years, several successful initiatives have been established to bridge the artificial separation between oral health and overall health by addressing the oral health knowledge gap in medical education, training medical personnel to look for oral disease and provide oral hygiene and dietary counseling, and engaging them in interprofessional practice. The Smiles for Life National Oral Health Curriculum, launched in 2005, covers oral health across the lifespan and is a free, open-access resource that provides continuing education credit for both medical and dental professionals ([Society of Teachers of Family Medicine 2021](#ch2.ref477)). The curriculum, which is endorsed by 20 professional organizations, has more than 100,000 registered users. As of April 2021, more than 400,000 courses had been accessed for continuing education credit ([Society of Teachers of Family Medicine 2021](#ch2.ref477)).\n\nMedicaid pays medical providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia for child oral health services, including fluoride varnish application ([Pew Charitable Trusts 2011](#ch2.ref401); [Clark et al. 2014](#ch2.ref102)). The MORE Care program (DentaQuest) specifically trains rural primary care practices in primary and secondary oral health preventive services and provides technical assistance to integrate the work of medical teams and their oral health counterparts. Some of these programs also train general dentists who have not previously treated young children to start offering early childhood examinations and preventive services, particularly in rural areas where pediatric dentists are scarce ([Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment 2020](#ch2.ref108)). Integration of oral hygiene counseling, dietary advice, and fluoride varnish application fits nicely into the well-child primary care conducted by rural family physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, provided the necessary additional time is built into their schedules or other clinical staff are trained to help.\n\n#### Medical Settings\n\nBetter integration of dental and medical care could lead to more people receiving preventive dental services. Efforts to improve integration of medicine and dentistry have been slow to develop since 2000. Although interest has grown in the role that nondental health care providers and settings could play in improving oral health, dental care delivery within medical settings requires providers to have knowledge beyond what traditionally has been provided in their training. In response to this need, oral health curricular content in medical, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant programs has increased, and some family medicine residency programs have begun requiring rotations in dental clinics for resident physicians. However, the impact of increased curricular exposure on practice and patient outcomes remains unclear, especially in the absence of interoperable electronic health records, common referral processes, and insurance coverage ([Dwiel et al. 2019](#ch2.ref141)).\n\nThe specific role of frontline medical providers in delivering dental care is still not well defined. However, it has become common for pediatric medical providers to apply fluoride varnish to children\u2019s teeth, a service that is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and universally reimbursed by Medicaid, as well as by most private insurers. Dental hygienist-led screening and preventive treatments, such as dental prophylaxis, have been successfully integrated into the pediatric primary care setting, including in the Colorado Medical-Dental Integration Project ([Braun and Cusick 2016](#ch2.ref61)). Similar care models have been proposed for adult populations, although lack of insurance coverage for adults is a barrier to expanding equivalent services. Additional information on medical-dental integration is provided in [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/).\n\n#### Community Settings\n\nEfforts to improve population health and reduce inequities, particularly for chronic diseases such as those often experienced by low-income and other vulnerable populations, can be enhanced through integration of community-based preventive service with professionally delivered clinical services as well as efforts aimed at increasing family-level engagement and empowerment ([Dietz et al. 2015](#ch2.ref136)). Delivery of clinical preventive services, long a focus of U.S. dental care, can be highly effective in addressing the chronic oral diseases of caries and periodontal disease. However, delivery of these services is largely dependent on access to routine dental care. Furthermore, financing for dental prevention is weighted toward the clinical interventions that focus on individual patient encounters with dental professionals. Community-based prevention programs, a foundation of public health, occur outside of the clinical care delivery system (e.g., water fluoridation, school-based programs, health-promoting policies). As such they do not rely on access to dental offices and generally reach a broader population and fill in gaps in access to prevention services, particularly for those individuals who do not regularly seek care in dental offices.\n\nSometimes overlooked is the important role of individual behaviors as contributors to oral disease prevention. As [Dietz and others (2015)](#ch2.ref136) note, motivation and a supportive family environment are critical for developing and maintaining healthy behaviors and should be considered part of an integrated health care system. For example, community-level programs that reinforce the importance of appropriate self-care, such as toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste and reduction of risky behaviors such as smoking, can provide broad benefits for population oral health.\n\nFull integration across all levels of the health system will likely lead to optimal benefit for population health and reduction in oral health inequities. This requires that public and private policymakers at all levels (local, state, and national) create the environment that allows for maximum access to prevention services as well as access to health-promoting food and other conditions. Assuring that prevention efforts will benefit the broadest number of individuals and have maximum impact on population health generally depends on the degree to which prevention services are delivered at all levels. Coordination and integration can be especially important to ensure that low-income and other vulnerable populations receive the benefit of prevention interventions. As dental care delivery continues to evolve into more complex multi-provider systems of care and these systems integrate with primary medical care, new opportunities will arise for integration of clinical services with community programs.\n\n### Quality of Oral Health Care\n\nThe Triple Aim of health care articulated by [Berwick and colleagues (2008)](#ch2.ref53)\u2014improving the health of populations, improving patient experience with care, and reducing costs\u2014laid the foundation for the value proposition in health care. A value-based system drives improvement based on outcomes relative to resource use and focuses particularly on those outcomes that are most important to patients ([Porter 2010](#ch2.ref413)). Access, structure, and process measures that are associated with improved outcomes are useful tools for assessing and improving quality of care. Current oral health care performance measures fall largely in the process of care domain ([Righolt et al. 2019](#ch2.ref421)). Ultimately, however, the true markers of success are whether patient and population outcomes have improved. Although several endeavors are beginning to identify tools to assess outcomes ([Liu et al. 2016](#ch2.ref308); [FDI World Dental Federation 2018](#ch2.ref155); [Mittal et al. 2019](#ch2.ref347)), there are continued challenges in implementing data collection systems and infrastructure to aggregate clinical data from each patient encounter to ultimately achieve a population-level learning health system ([Institute of Medicine 2013a](#ch2.ref242)).\n\nSeveral areas offer promise for improving the quality of care, including the development of new dental diagnostic codes and clinical practice guidelines. Yet the adoption is slow in the majority of clinical practice settings. National metrics on oral health status, such as those within the federal Healthy People initiative and the CMS Child Core Set, offer promise for informing better oral health policy. However, at present, new policy initiatives aimed at improving access and prevention are not evident.\n\n### Oral Health Literacy\n\nInterest in oral health literacy has increased substantially during the past 2 decades. Research on the relationship between health literacy and oral health shows that low levels of health literacy are correlated with poor oral health knowledge ([Hom et al. 2012](#ch2.ref225); [Horowitz et al. 2013](#ch2.ref226); [Macek et al. 2017](#ch2.ref311)), suboptimal oral health behaviors such as limited use of preventive care ([White et al. 2008](#ch2.ref559); [Bennett et al. 2009](#ch2.ref50); [Henderson et al. 2018](#ch2.ref216)), and negative oral health outcomes ([Vann et al. 2010](#ch2.ref532); [Batista et al. 2017](#ch2.ref45)).\n\nEnsuring that individuals understand what their medical and dental plans cover is important because out-of-pocket costs can discourage the use of dental services ([Vujicic et al. 2016a](#ch2.ref541)). Many coverage options are now available. For example, some dental benefits are embedded in medical plans ([Cousart et al. 2015](#ch2.ref118)). Dental services covered by commercial insurers and state Medicaid programs vary greatly ([Willink et al. 2016](#ch2.ref564)), and their explanations of benefits can be confusing.\n\nInformed consent is another essential aspect of patient care that requires participation among patients and providers. A patient\u2019s signature on a consent form, however, does not guarantee complete understanding of the risks, benefits, and alternatives associated with the proposed treatment ([Kinnersley et al. 2013](#ch2.ref276)). A study of consent forms used for dental care indicated that the average American adult would have difficulty understanding most of them ([Glick et al. 2010](#ch2.ref184)), suggesting that considerably more work is needed to ensure that all patients fully understand their options for dental treatment. Patients with low health literacy are less likely to understand to what they are consenting, although understanding of the consent process is poor regardless of literacy skills and may lead to unnecessary refusal of treatment ([Aldoory et al. 2014](#ch2.ref11)). One study demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple teach-back technique to ensure comprehension of informed consent procedures for low health-literate populations ([Sudore et al. 2006](#ch2.ref489)).\n\nEffective communication is a patient safety issue. The medical community has long recognized the importance of health literacy in developing providers\u2019 skills for communicating effectively with patients to ensure safety. An Institute of Medicine (IOM) white paper describes 10 desirable attributes of a health-literate health care organization ([Brach et al. 2012](#ch2.ref60)). These include preparing the workforce to be health literate, using health literacy strategies in interpersonal communications, and confirming understanding of health information at all points of contact. The Joint Commission initiated a public policy initiative in 2001 to address issues that could affect health care providers\u2019 delivery of safe, high-quality health care. In 2007, it launched a new perspective on the initiative, with a framework that highlighted health literacy as a way to protect patient safety. The framework has three components: (1) making effective communication an organizational priority to protect the safety of patients, (2) incorporating strategies to address patients\u2019 communication needs across the care continuum, and (3) pursuing policy changes that promote improved practitioner\u2013patient communications ([The Joint Commission 2007](#ch2.ref494)).\n\nA culture of patient safety in dentistry involves not only making oral health information clear and accessible but also contextualizing that information in patients\u2019 lives. Dental providers who use effective communication techniques contribute to greater oral health literacy\u2014the patients\u2019 ability to understand and act upon the information provided to improve their oral health ([Horowitz et al. 2012](#ch2.ref228); [Maybury et al. 2013](#ch2.ref325)). Yet some studies show that dental providers continue to need support in using evidence-based communication practices with their patients ([Rozier et al. 2011](#ch2.ref428); [Tseng et al. 2020](#ch2.ref503)). Furthermore, evidence suggests that dental and dental hygiene students graduate without the skills necessary to meet the literacy needs of their patients ([Bress 2013](#ch2.ref67); [McKenzie 2014](#ch2.ref329)). Consequently, the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) recently suggested a revision to its standards to include health literacy to help ensure that dental students are able to effectively communicate with their patients. Although CODA Accreditation Standards for Dental Hygiene Education include a standard that requires oral and written communication be included in the general education content, and another standard that requires graduates to have an understanding of how cultural influences can affect delivery of care, there are none specific to health literacy ([Commission on Dental Accreditation 2018](#ch2.ref110)).\n\nEducating the professional dental community about health literacy remains a major challenge. Environmental scans of health center dental clinics in Maryland showed that current practices related to oral health literacy lacked consistency ([Horowitz et al. 2014](#ch2.ref227)). Prioritizing health literacy as a means to protect patient safety in dentistry starts with the dental education system and training future providers how to effectively communicate interpersonally with patients. Continued learning opportunities after graduation also may improve patient safety, as well as patient and population oral health status, and contribute to decreased disparities. Recent calls for required continuing education on health literacy and cultural competency for all dental providers is one approach that may help to improve the use of effective communication techniques ([Rozier et al. 2011](#ch2.ref428); [Bress 2013](#ch2.ref67); [McKenzie 2014](#ch2.ref329)).\n\nIn the only reported population-based study linking oral health literacy and attitudes toward population-level oral health promotion strategies, [Curiel and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref122) showed that an increase of one standard deviation in health literacy scores predicted a 12% increase for support of community water fluoridation. There is evidence that health literacy may contribute to sociodemographic differences in oral health behavior. For example, [Bennett and colleagues (2009)](#ch2.ref50) found that health literacy significantly mediated education disparities related to utilization of dental care among older adults.\n\nIn reviewing oral health literacy measurement, [Dickson-Swift and colleagues (2014)](#ch2.ref135) identified 14 different measures used in 32 studies. However, the majority of investigators relied on one of two measures\u2014the Rapid Estimation of Adult Health Literacy in Dentistry or the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Dentistry. There is a need for development and assessment of improved methods to measure oral health literacy across diverse populations. In addition, the mechanisms through which health literacy influences oral health in general and how health literacy might differ across social subgroups need to be clarified ([Jones et al. 2016](#ch2.ref262)), because such understanding is required to appropriately target literacy interventions.\n\nIn 2010, health literacy became the focus of both national legislative efforts and federal agency research after the ACA was signed into law. The ACA emphasized the need to increase health literacy among the general public, especially for those with lower income and/or education levels ([HealthCare.gov 2021](#ch2.ref214)). In addition, the Plain Writing Act of 2010 mandated that federal documents designed for public audiences (e.g., Medicaid applications) be written in plain language. The law specified that each federal agency should train employees in the use of plain language, create and maintain a plain writing section on the agency\u2019s website, and establish a process to oversee agency compliance ([111th United States Congress 2010](#ch2.ref2)).\n\nTwo federal agencies also contributed to the national focus on health literacy. In 2010, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality published the first edition of the Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit. A second edition was released in 2015 ([Brega et al. 2015](#ch2.ref65)). The aim of the toolkit is to guide primary care providers in implementing system-wide changes to improve communication with, and support for, patients of all health literacy levels. In an earlier effort, in 2004, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research convened a workshop aimed at promoting the national oral health literacy research agenda. The workshop\u2014which targeted researchers in oral health, cognition, adult education, and communications\u2014served to educate the research community about the need to expand understanding of oral health literacy ([National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research 2005](#ch2.ref367)).\n\nMore recently, the Healthy People 2030 national initiative increased attention to health literacy by making \u201cincrease the health literacy of the population\u201d one of its overarching goals. The initiative also includes new definitions of health literacy that address both personal and organizational health literacy. Personal health literacy is defined as \u201cthe degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.\u201d The definition of organizational health literacy, which aligns with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010b](#ch2.ref517)), is \u201cthe degree to which organizations equitably enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others\u201d ([U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2020c](#ch2.ref520)).\n\nProfessional organizations also took a greater interest in health literacy as a public health concern. In 2010, the Oral Health Section of the American Public Health Association developed the policy \u201cHealth Literacy: Confronting a National Public Health Problem\u201d ([American Public Health Association 2010](#ch2.ref29)). The policy statement was broad; it urged Congress to require government documents to be written in plain language and urged federal and state agencies to increase health literacy among children in grades K\u201312 and train health providers in the use of recommended communication techniques. The American Dental Association (ADA) established a National Advisory Committee on Health Literacy in Dentistry, part of the ADA\u2019s Council on Advocacy for Access and Prevention (formerly called the Council on Access, Prevention, and Interprofessional Relations). The committee developed a long-range plan that included providing education on health literacy at the ADA annual session, analyzing ADA\u2019s written patient materials to ensure they are written in plain language, and conducting surveys of their members\u2019 and dental students\u2019 use of recommended communication techniques ([Rozier et al. 2011](#ch2.ref428); [Podschun 2012](#ch2.ref412)).\n\nIn 2013, the IOM Roundtable on Health Literacy published the proceedings of a workshop on oral health literacy ([Institute of Medicine 2013b](#ch2.ref243)). Interestingly, when the roundtable was established in 2006, its membership included no dentists. In 2019, however, two dentists were active members and most of the roundtable\u2019s workshops now include a focus on oral health.\n\nIn 2000, oral health literacy was barely on the radar screen. Since that time, numerous instruments for measuring oral health literacy have been developed and investigators have pursued research aimed at understanding the link between health literacy and oral health. Health literacy has become a national priority, receiving attention from federal agencies, foundations, and professional organizations.\n\n### Oral Health and Quality of Life\n\nMeasures of oral health-related quality of life have been used in national surveys and as an outcome measure in clinical trials. In the case of population-based oral health surveys, the most widely used instrument has been the shortened version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) ([Slade 1997](#ch2.ref472)). The data from these studies have shed useful insights into the varying impacts of oral diseases and their treatment at the population level ([Locker and Quinonez 2009](#ch2.ref309); [Benn et al. 2015](#ch2.ref49); [Parker et al. 2016](#ch2.ref395); [Zusman et al. 2016](#ch2.ref583); [Tsakos et al. 2017](#ch2.ref502); [Torppa-Saarinen et al. 2018](#ch2.ref500); [Masood et al. 2019](#ch2.ref322)). Developments during the past 20 years have enabled movement toward patient- and population-centered outcomes for several oral conditions and their treatments. These advancements align with the World Health Organization\u2019s conceptualization of health as more than the absence of disease, but a state of physical, mental, and social well-being ([World Health Organization 1946](#ch2.ref567)). For example, pediatric oral health-related quality-of-life measures have been used to gauge the social impact of such conditions as early childhood dental caries ([Tinanoff et al. 2019](#ch2.ref496)). Oral health-related quality-of-life measures have been used to assess the impact of dental care at the individual level, such as endodontic treatment ([Neelakantan et al. 2019](#ch2.ref373)), implant-supported overdentures ([Sharka et al. 2019](#ch2.ref460)), or orthodontic treatment ([Ferrando-Magraner et al. 2019](#ch2.ref159)), as well as the impact of policies and programs at the population or community levels ([Ha et al. 2012](#ch2.ref201); [Burgette et al. 2017](#ch2.ref71); [Ho et al. 2019](#ch2.ref221); [Seo and Kim 2019](#ch2.ref459); [Tomazoni et al. 2019](#ch2.ref499)).\n\n### Oral Health Surveillance for Population Health Planning\n\nPublic health surveillance provides data and information on the burden and distribution of disease and other health-related conditions. This information helps to monitor interventions and disease control measures that have been implemented to improve health, set public health goals, and assess for emerging conditions that might pose a threat to public health. In the past 2 decades, rapid advances in information technology have transformed our ability to use data for decision making, ushering in new fields of interest in health informatics, particularly in public health informatics ([Groseclose and Buckeridge 2017](#ch2.ref195)).\n\nPublic health practitioners utilizing these informatics tools can have an important impact on the health and well-being of populations at local, state, and national levels ([Friede et al. 1995](#ch2.ref168); [McNabb et al. 2006](#ch2.ref332)). Although the application of health informatics is substantially advanced in medicine and health care, it remains in an early stage of development in dentistry and oral health care. This presents several challenges. Many oral health surveillance activities in the United States are dependent on active surveillance measures, which are resource intense and are often periodic. Active surveillance also requires a substantial commitment to maintain the infrastructure. On the other hand, an ongoing passive surveillance system using informatics concepts can potentially provide more consistent and timely oral health data about population health for many important planning purposes. Such systems require greater functionality within dental electronic health records than exist today. Nevertheless, enhanced investments in oral health monitoring and surveillance activities, including in dental public health informatics, could facilitate the evaluation of interventions and disease control measures and could lead to evidence-based approaches that improve oral health and reduce health disparities.\n\nThe goal of surveillance programs is to provide essential data for program planning and support efforts that lead to improved population health and decreased oral health inequities. The Association of State and Territorial Directors cautions that, to meet those goals, data collection alone is insufficient. Features that support an effective surveillance system include collection of standardized and actionable health information, rapid analysis and dissemination of findings, and buy-in from policymakers when policy solutions are indicated ([Phipps et al. 2013](#ch2.ref405)).\n\n### Oral Health and National Security\n\nThe military continues to face challenges in meeting recruitment goals and military readiness because of oral health-related issues. Today, fewer than 1% of potential Air Force recruits are rejected because of extremely severe dental conditions. However, among new recruits entering the Air Force, nearly all have some level of unmet dental treatment needs, and about a quarter (23%) suffer from serious oral conditions that prevent them from deploying ([Irwin 2019a](#ch2.ref249)).\n\nIn the deployed environment, disease and nonbattle injuries (DNBI) accounted for the majority (75%) of all casualties ([Zouris et al. 2008](#ch2.ref582)). Of DNBIs, 15\u201322% were dental-related emergencies ([Dunn 2004](#ch2.ref140)). During Operation Iraqi Freedom, nearly 17% of deployed members required acute dental care while deployed. In FY 2018, 20% of dental visits during deployment were emergency related ([Irwin 2019b](#ch2.ref248)). These dental emergencies can risk a deployed unit\u2019s ability to complete a mission and require costly and dangerous medical evacuations by ground convoy, helicopter, and/or fixed-wing aircraft. In FY 2017, nearly one-fifth (18%) of all medevacs were the result of dental emergencies in locations where dental teams were not deployed, and each medevac cost an average of nearly $100,000.\n\nMeeting recruitment goals for dental professionals is another challenge, with recruitment of oral and maxillofacial surgeons a particular challenge. Specifically, between FY 2012 and 2016, the Navy was not able to recruit additional oral and maxillofacial surgeons ([U.S. Government Accountability Office 2018](#ch2.ref528)). Instead, the Navy maintained high levels of dental readiness by training the necessary oral and maxillofacial surgeons through in-house training programs fully accredited by CODA. Continued focus on recruiting and/or training the necessary numbers and types of oral health providers will be needed to maintain high levels of readiness.\n\nThe services, in turn, are reevaluating the number and specialty mix of uniformed providers needed to support the warfighting mission ([Philpott 2019](#ch2.ref404)). This will include some reduction in total numbers of providers as those positions are transferred to warfighter roles to meet the Secretary of Defense\u2019s priorities. The intention is to use purchased care to handle the potential reduction in access to military facilities. It is unclear how this might affect dental wellness.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the U.S. Navy has made significant progress integrating dental and medical care. The dental technician rating merged with hospital corpsman. Consequently, all active-duty enlisted personnel with assignments primarily related to dental care receive more advanced medical skills training and acquire greater understanding of how dental health relates to overall health and well-being. Additional training in oral health issues is now provided for the hospital corpsman. This allows greater flexibility and utilization of medical enlisted personnel and a broadening of individual career opportunities ([U.S. Department of the Navy 2005](#ch2.ref524)).\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has made significant progress in improving the dental readiness of airmen over the past 2 decades. In 2001, nearly half (45%) of airmen had a dental readiness classification (DRC) of either DRC 2 or DRC 3 for oral health conditions that required treatment. By 2018, just 22% of the force had any current dental treatment needs. Similarly, over the last 2 decades, the percentage of airmen classified as high risk for caries has decreased 50% (from 11% in 2001 to 5.6% in 2017) ([Schindler et al. 2021](#ch2.ref449)). Today, more than 95% of active-duty airmen are DRC 1 or 2 and dentally ready to deploy.\n\nTobacco smoking among airmen also declined substantially during this period\u2014from 22% in 2001 to just 8.9% in 2017\u2014a 60% reduction ([Schindler et al. 2021](#ch2.ref449)). Although the prevalence of smoking historically has been higher in the military than in the general U.S. population, overall the prevalence of smoking today is actually lower among airmen (8.9%) than among the civilian population (14%) (Creamer et al. 2019). A key contributing factor to the decline in smoking includes intervention efforts of Air Force dentists through free smoking cessation programs for airmen. Air Force Dental Service (AFDS) providers are being trained to provide tobacco cessation counseling and related pharmacotherapy to tobacco and e-cigarette users. E-cigarette use is highly prevalent among youth and young adults, some of whom are beginning to enter the Air Force. Data from an ongoing Air Force public health assessment revealed that among all airmen, the prevalence of e-cigarette/vaping product use had risen from 5% to nearly 8% since October 2017. Studies indicate that e-cigarette use among young populations may increase the risk of using combustible and other types of tobacco products ([Soneji et al. 2017](#ch2.ref480)). In the coming years, vaping/tobacco cessation interventions to aid cessation of tobacco use, including vaping products, by AFDS providers may be key to preventing an increase in overall tobacco use among airmen. In addition, the Air Force Dental Corps have developed certified tobacco treatment specialists who provide training to dental providers to improve access to smoking cessation treatments.\n\n## Chapter 3. Promising New Directions\n\n### Social Determinants of Health and Commercial Determinants of Health\n\n[Watt and colleagues (2014)](#ch2.ref557) argued that the social determinants of oral health disparities were the same as those associated with other health disparities, such as those related to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and that improving social and economic conditions supported improvements in health generally, including oral health. For example, by improving someone\u2019s income and education, or by providing broader income supports and access to education for a population, it is reasonable to assume that improvements in diet and reductions in stress would occur. In turn, these improvements could be expected to reduce risks related to a broad array of diseases, including dental caries, periodontal disease, prediabetes, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension.\n\nMany of the social and commercial determinants of health are structural in nature. Alleviating the inequities they create will require interventions that focus not only on individual behavior and biological determinants of oral health but also on social and commercial determinants ([Sabbah et al. 2009](#ch2.ref435)). This means that there is potential to mitigate inequities in oral health with large-scale policy changes that alter the structural determinants of health. These policy changes, including regulations supporting such issues as income security and food security, are politically challenging. However, these conversations are becoming more prevalent in societal and political discourse today.\n\n### Vulnerable Populations and Oral Health Disparities\n\nPolicy changes advanced by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) include promotion of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) ([Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2018](#ch2.ref6)). The PCMH emphasizes comprehensive and coordinated patient-centered care, accessible services, quality, and safety. However, dentistry has not yet become a significant partner in this initiative. As [Wasserman and colleagues (2019)](#ch2.ref553) note, although the impact of the PCMH has not yet been empirically demonstrated, the increased emphasis of the PCMH on primary care, prevention, and community-based service delivery holds promise. Incorporating oral health services is a logical next step in the development of this initiative.\n\n#### Rural Populations\n\nWell-documented disparities in rural oral health outcomes have led to inquiry and innovation. Integration of oral health into primary care, interprofessional practice, teledentistry, school-based oral health services, and the addition of dental therapists to the dental professional workforce provide opportunities to reduce oral health disparities among rural populations (National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services 2018).\n\nIntegrating oral health into primary care is particularly important because primary care medical providers\u2014particularly family medicine physicians and pediatricians\u2014are widely distributed across the United States, including rural areas where they offer preventive care, early diagnosis of disease, and prompt referral when subspecialty care is indicated. Primary care medical providers, therefore, are well-positioned to work with dentists to comanage diseases with known oral-systemic connections, such as diabetes and periodontitis.\n\nAs rural areas acquire increased Internet bandwidth, telemedicine and teledentistry are becoming viable methods for delivering expertise to rural areas, saving patients the time and expense of travel, and expanding available services. In response, some states are modifying health care providers\u2019 scope of practice to accommodate virtual doctor-patient interactions. The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, operating under the Health Resources and Services Administration, has more than doubled its budget since 2016 and provided substantial grant funding for teledentistry and mobile dentistry initiatives. These teledentistry models, such as California\u2019s virtual dental home, may expand access to dental care in remote and underserved areas, with the understanding that effective payment models and mechanisms for timely referral for more intensive dental needs will need to be developed ([Glassman et al. 2014](#ch2.ref182)).\n\nOpportunities to expand access and improve the rural dental safety net are being explored and developed. Because most professional practice policies are implemented at the state level, these include changes in state law related to scope of practice and the oral health workforce. An example of coalition building to advocate for change in state law to improve oral health is the Foundation for Health Leadership and Innovation, North Carolina Oral Health Collaborative. This collaboration brings together a diverse group of stakeholders focused on improving access to oral health care in rural areas and among populations with high oral health disparities ([Box 2](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box2/?report=objectonly)). Other states are amending their state practice acts to improve population health, including Pennsylvania, which now certifies public health dental hygiene practitioners to provide care in a variety of public health settings without the supervision or prior authorization of a dentist.\n\nExpansion of dental therapy is another promising model, given the evidence of improvements in dental outcomes in rural areas where dental therapists practice ([Koppelman et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref282)). Minnesota authorized a dental therapist program in 2009, and other states now have similar pending legislation regarding dental therapists. The original goal for developing this new category of oral health provider was to fill the unmet needs of rural and underserved children ([Nash and Nagel 2005](#ch2.ref355); [Friedman and Mathu-Muju 2014b](#ch2.ref169)), but there is evidence that they also are helping to meet the needs of the rural elderly ([Fish-Parcham et al. 2019](#ch2.ref162)), particularly those in extended-care facilities. Both school-based programs for children and extended-care facilities for the elderly exemplify population-based approaches to improving access to care by meeting people where they live, work, and play.\n\nProgram evaluations in Alaska and Minnesota found that the clinical care provided by therapists was clinically competent, appropriate, and provided in safe ways. An evaluation of the Alaska program by [Chi and colleagues (2018b)](#ch2.ref96) found that villages that employed therapists had increases in access to dental services and prevention services and less need for extractions and treatment under general anesthesia. The success of these programs speaks to the potential of this model to benefit vulnerable rural populations in varied geographic settings.\n\nPrograms intended to recruit and train rural dentists also have the potential to create major improvements in rural access. Several dental schools have developed programs to incentivize dentists to practice in rural communities, including the University of Washington\u2019s RIDE program, the University of Minnesota\u2019s Rural Dental Scholars program, and the University of Mississippi\u2019s Rural Dentists Scholarship program. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship and loan repayment programs support almost 500 rural dentists, although the number of dental providers in the program has not increased as substantially as that of other clinicians supported by the NHSC ([Pathman and Konrad 2012](#ch2.ref397)). National rural primary care training programs\u2014such as the HRSA-funded academic unit, Rural Primary Care Research, Education, and Practice\u2014may serve as models for future rural oral health expansion ([Rural Primary Care 2019](#ch2.ref433)).\n\n### Box 2How can diverse groups of stakeholders collaborate to improve access to oral health care in their state?\n\nThe North Carolina Oral Health Collaborative (NCOHC), a program of the Foundation for Health Leadership & Innovation, was established In 2013 to Increase access and equity In oral health care for North Carolina\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Policy advocacy is a major activity for NCOHC. By bringing together community organizations, professional societies, health providers, academics, and legislators, IsCOHC leverages civerse perspectives for the development of evidence-based policy reforms. In 2020, NCOHC influenced a regulatory rules change that allows dental hygienists to provide preventive services (cleanings, x-rays, sealants, fluoride applications, screening) in high-need settings without a prior examination by a dentist. This change increases direct access, builds a culture of community-based dentistry, and brings care to people where they are.\n\nIn 2021, NCOHC and its key stakeholders drafted and introduced legislation in the North Carolira General Assembly to codify teledentistry in the state\u2019s Dental Practice Act. To support this pending change, NCOHC provided financial support to Federally Qualified Health Centers and local health departments for implementation of teledentistry.\n\nNCOHC recently completed a 2-year community capacity building mini-grant initiative. Grants were awarded to seven organizations working with populations with high oral health disparities. Activities included NCOHC-organized events and trainings and focus group meetings to discuss local oral health needs. One of the goals was to develop the 2019\u20132024 North Carol na oral health change agenda, which was completed and published in 2019.\n\nThere now are more than 1300 partners and organizations in NCOHC. Current and former funders include the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation, The Duke Endowment, the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust, and the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health (formerly the DentaQuest Partnership for Oral Health Advancement).\n\nAs already discussed, the existing rural primary medical care workforce could provide a substantial resource for improving rural oral health. Nationally, delivery of preventive oral health services within pediatric practices occurs at lower rates in rural communities ([Geiger et al. 2019](#ch2.ref179)). Because of higher rates of primary medical\u2014rather than dental\u2014utilization, the primary medical care setting can serve as an access point for oral health screening, treatment, and referral ([Davis et al. 2010](#ch2.ref129); [Caldwell et al. 2017](#ch2.ref73)). Several states with large rural populations have implemented integrated practice models, often focused on pediatric populations. In these models, such as North Carolina\u2019s Into the Mouths of Babes program ([Pahel et al. 2011](#ch2.ref390)) and the Colorado Medical-Dental Integration Project ([Braun and Cusick 2016](#ch2.ref61)), families receive preventive oral health care services and screening within the primary care setting ([Blackburn et al. 2017](#ch2.ref54)). There are 4,500 rural health clinics widely distributed across the nation delivering primary medical care, but they currently are not required to provide preventive dental services. Adding dental services to the scope of care in these clinics would significantly expand the dental safety net ([American Dental Education Association 2018](#ch2.ref27)) while efficiently leveraging existing resources and personnel.\n\nShifting the distribution of dentists from urban areas to rural communities is a longer term solution to improve rural access to oral health care. The task of producing more rural dentists is similar to that of producing rural physicians; both depend on a complex combination of admission preferences, curriculum, mentorship, personal lifestyle choices, and incentives ([McFarland et al. 2010](#ch2.ref328); [Vujicic et al. 2016b](#ch2.ref543)). Dental schools could increase the use of a strategy that some medical schools have successfully implemented by creating rural tracks designed to attract, admit, and mentor students who are interested in rural practice and by creating residency programs targeted to the skills required for rural practice ([Downey et al. 2010](#ch2.ref138); [WWAMI Rural Health Research Center 2012](#ch2.ref575); [Deutchman 2013](#ch2.ref134); [Suphanchaimat et al. 2016](#ch2.ref491)).\n\n#### Low-Income Populations\n\nCommunity water fluoridation achieved wide success in the mid-20th century for primary prevention of dental caries ([Carstairs 2015](#ch2.ref78)). In the 21st century, community water fluoridation has again captured national public health interest, this time for its effects in reducing socioeconomic disparities in dental caries. Not only does water fluoridation confer a protective effect beyond that offered by other sources of fluoride ([Slade et al. 2018](#ch2.ref474)), it can especially benefit children in low-income families ([Sanders et al. 2019](#ch2.ref438)). A study compared levels of dental caries in two groups of children: those living in counties where at least 75% of the population received optimally fluoridated drinking water, versus those in counties with a lower percentage of the population with fluoridated drinking water ([Sanders et al. 2019](#ch2.ref438)). Findings showed that living in a predominantly fluoridated county reduced the magnitude of income disparities in dental caries. The findings are important from a health policy perspective. Efforts to expand population coverage of community water fluoridation that intentionally target counties with high concentrations of families with lower income could yield greater benefits in reducing both dental caries and income disparities in dental caries.\n\n#### Black or African American Populations\n\nIn 2017, 21.2% of non-Hispanic Blacks in the United States lived below the poverty line\u2014the highest of any racial group ([Semega et al. 2018a](#ch2.ref456)). The median household income of non-Hispanic Blacks in 2017 was $40,258, the lowest of any racial group ([Semega et al. 2018b](#ch2.ref457)). Thus, the substantial number of non-Hispanic Blacks potentially at risk for oral diseases by income and social pathways alone requires approaches that are geared more towards health equity. Health systems in the United States are starting to incorporate social determinants into health assessment protocols to learn more about which of these may be more influential to health ([Gottlieb et al. 2014](#ch2.ref188)). In addition, health systems and organizations focused on both disease prevention and care provision are beginning to prioritize oral health through integrated care models and value-based care models ([Solomon and Kanter 2018](#ch2.ref479)).\n\n#### Hispanic Populations\n\nAccess to new datasets related to Hispanic population health has enabled new research. The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) dataset has several affiliated ancillary studies that explore specific topics in greater depth and have potential to further clarify the role of cultural factors in oral health. The HCHS/SOL has a sociocultural ancillary study with a subset of participants ([Gallo et al. 2014](#ch2.ref174)) that included more validated cultural measures for a range of psychological stressors and resources than what was available in the main study. Several oral health analyses are underway that will advance the field\u2019s understanding of cultural factors among Hispanics in the United States. Advances in genomic studies related to the oral health status of adult Hispanics have been made in recent years, and HCHS/SOL data have been used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) ([Conomos et al. 2016](#ch2.ref115)). To date, published HCHS/SOL GWAS studies have focused on temporomandibular disorders ([Sanders et al. 2017a](#ch2.ref439)), dental caries ([Morrison et al. 2015](#ch2.ref350)), and chronic periodontitis ([Sanders et al. 2017b](#ch2.ref442)). This new series of studies based on HCHS/SOL data will advance identification of the biologic/genetic factors associated with oral diseases for Hispanic Americans.\n\nLevel of acculturation and the influence of other cultural factors among Hispanic Americans are now being studied in greater depth to advance understanding of their relationships to oral health status and practices. For instance, familism, or *familismo*, is a core cultural concept that describes the importance of immediate and extended family in Latino families ([Stein et al. 2014](#ch2.ref484)). Exploratory research is emerging on the role of *familismo* in an oral health context ([Maupome et al. 2016](#ch2.ref324)). In the HCHS/SOL dataset, cultural factors related to ethnic identity (measured by a sense of belongingness) and acculturation were associated with oral health-related quality of life, although overall there were inconsistent patterns of association in adjusted models ([Silveira et al. 2020](#ch2.ref464)).\n\n#### American Indian and Alaska Native Populations\n\nNew dental care delivery technologies, such as teledentistry, can especially benefit remote-living American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations ([Glassman et al. 2012](#ch2.ref183)). Legislative approaches that address social determinants of health (SDoH) also are being developed. A bipartisan bill, the Social Determinants Accelerator Act of 2019 (H.R. 4004) ([116th United States Congress 2019](#ch2.ref4)), was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives ([Luthi 2019](#ch2.ref310)) and although it was specifically related to Native Americans, it had the potential to benefit many population groups. The legislation would provide technical assistance to local, state, and tribal governments to develop innovative approaches to provide services and improve outcomes ([116th United States Congress 2019](#ch2.ref4)). A new framework encompassing SDoH in dental education emphasizes a need for reframing the current teaching structure to include health inequities, population health and diversity, and cultural competence ([Tiwari and Palatta 2019](#ch2.ref498)).\n\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) Loan Repayment Program is available to fund IHS clinicians to repay their eligible health profession education loans in exchange for an initial 2-year service commitment to practice in health facilities serving AI/AN communities. Opportunities are based on Indian health program facilities with the greatest staffing needs in specific health profession disciplines ([Indian Health Service 2021c](#ch2.ref235)).\n\nThe IHS Scholarship Program provides qualified AI/AN health profession students an opportunity to establish an educational foundation for each stage of their preprofessional careers. Since IHS began providing scholarship support to AI/AN students to pursue health profession careers in 1978, the program has grown to support, educate, and place health care professionals within medically underserved Native American health programs throughout the continental United States and Alaska. Today, nearly 7,000 AI/AN students have received scholarship awards, and many have committed to serving their professional careers at IHS.\n\n### Oral Health for Those with Special Health Care Needs\n\nThere is a growing realization that dental services delivered in the community provide better dental access for vulnerable populations than do traditional brick-and-mortar dental care delivery systems. These services include using mobile and portable equipment, telehealth-connected teams to involve outside dentists, and allied oral health personnel applying aspects of modern prevention science, including minimally invasive treatment techniques. There is growing interest in integration of oral health activities into general health, educational, and social service settings. The integration of general health and oral health care systems will drive incentives to create better oral health for individuals with special needs or complex health conditions. The movement from volume to value will have particular impact on oral health care for this population.\n\n### Financing Dental Care\n\nWith flexibility built into the current system through Medicaid waivers and the capacity for value-added programs implemented by contracted dental health plans, we may see new initiatives aimed at providing better and more comprehensive oral health through Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs. Moving toward value-based care, where providers are given incentives to improve the oral health of a population, may help to improve dental coverage gaps and increase access, especially for low-income and ethnic minority patients ([Riley et al. 2019](#ch2.ref424)). There are other policy options available to expand dental insurance for working-age and older adults. Potential options include providing dental coverage for these adults as a mandatory benefit within Medicaid and Medicare, as well as considering dental care services for adults as essential services under the ACA.\n\n### Dental Care Delivery Models\n\nAccountable Care Organizations (ACO) are promising models for furthering integrated oral health care. ACOs provide comprehensive medical services through a model that offers incentives for both cost reduction and quality, generally through a capitated mechanism with incentive bonuses for meeting baseline quality measures. ACOs have proliferated since the adoption of the pioneer Medicare ACOs in 2012 ([Pham et al. 2014](#ch2.ref403)), based on systems developed in 2009 by Blue Cross Blue Shield in Massachusetts. Ten percent of Americans currently receive their care through an ACO utilizing both public and private insurance contracts ([Muhlestein et al. 2018](#ch2.ref352)).\n\nACOs represent a seismic shift away from fee-for-service reimbursement in medicine. Given the emphasis on quality of care and the responsibility of the ACO for all member costs, ACOs may be incentivized to pursue innovative models of dental care if they result in cost savings or improved outcomes. Although promising, only about one-fourth of Medicaid ACOs and one-tenth of contract ACOs nationwide were responsible for dental costs and quality in 2015 ([Colla et al. 2016](#ch2.ref106)). Even when oral health is included in ACO coverage responsibilities, dental care is most often reimbursed with conventional fee-for-service payments to contracted dental providers external to the ACO. A notable exception to this is Oregon\u2019s Medicaid ACO, which offers dental providers a per-member per-month (PMPM) fee that is carved out of the global PMPM budget for ACO enrollees ([Atchison et al. 2018](#ch2.ref38)).\n\nClinical innovation under the ACO umbrella lags even further\u2014in 2015, only 4% of ACOs had integrated dental clinicians into their care teams. ACOs that have introduced oral health quality measures have been limited to process rather than outcome measures, and those in effect have only been applied to pediatric populations. For example, a quality measure used by the Massachusetts Medicaid ACO is the percent of beneficiaries under age 21 receiving an annual dental visit, and the Oregon Medicaid ACO provides bonuses for increased dental sealant rates among beneficiaries aged 6 to 14 years.\n\nAddressing these concerns\u2014by increasing the numbers of ACOs, fine-tuning reimbursement options, and offering incentives for clinical innovation\u2014could make ACOs a valuable addition to dental care.\n\n### Oral Health Literacy\n\nImproving the health literacy of the U.S. population holds great promise to improving utilization and choice of dental care, leading to better oral health outcomes. The foundational skills underlying health literacy, such as reading and math, are typically developed in the context of regular schooling. Consequently, it is likely that health literacy skills of any group will correspond with the overall quality of their education system. Implementing educational strategies shown to effectively enhance reading, numeracy, and verbal communication skills can help individuals better manage their oral health. Incorporating real-world, oral health-related tasks into educational efforts might be particularly valuable, increasing both underlying health literacy skills and oral health knowledge at the same time. A focus on real-world needs often is implemented in adult basic education ([Murphy et al. 1996](#ch2.ref354)) and could be extended to other levels of the educational system.\n\n### Quality of Oral Health Care\n\nQuality oral health care delivery is advancing on several fronts. There is increased emphasis on the importance of full integration of medical and dental care as integral to a vision of Berwick\u2019s Triple Aim, which deploys new patient-centered quality metrics for improved planning and evaluation, better surveillance of population health, and reduced health care costs. Support for integration came from the [Institute of Medicine report (2011)](#ch2.ref241) that recommended integration of oral health in planning, programming, policies, and research in all U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agencies and programs.\n\nA necessary condition for integration is an interoperable electronic health record (EHR) capable of rapidly updating a patient\u2019s clinical status in a way that is accessible to members of the medical and dental teams. [Jones and colleagues (2017)](#ch2.ref261) provided several examples of organizations that offer promising integration models. These include the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Kaiser Permanente (Permanente Dental Associates), HealthPartners, PACE programs, and some Federally Qualified Health Centers. A highly adaptable model that is not dependent on a unique health care delivery infrastructure is the DentaQuest Medical Oral Expanded Care program ([CareQuest Institute for Oral Health 2021](#ch2.ref76)), which is both flexible and scalable. These models provide important guidance for others with interest in creating integrated health care.\n\nAnother innovation improving EHR effectiveness was motivated by state Medicaid policy requiring use of dental diagnostic codes (ICD-10 codes), now mandated in several states ([American Dental Association 2015b](#ch2.ref17)). Requirements for diagnostic codes in private insurance are still evolving. Diagnostic codes are central to medical records and provide the foundation for assessing quality of care. As their use in dentistry increases, benefits for care integration and advancement toward the Triple Aim\u2019s goals will be supported.\n\nA focus on population health outcomes requires attention to nonclinical determinants of health, as well as clinical determinants. The relevance of SDoH, such as poverty status, is explicitly recognized in the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse framework ([Figure 19](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig19/?report=objectonly)). Section 1115 of the Social Security Act promotes experimental or demonstration projects likely to forward the objectives of the Medicaid program. Population health outcomes and value are measured separately from health care treatment outcomes. Recognizing this, some states are successfully gaining approval for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 1115 demonstration projects to address the SDoH as a pathway to realizing improved outcomes. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is piloting a comprehensive program that targets such social determinants as housing instability, transportation barriers, and food insecurity ([North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services 2018](#ch2.ref378)). Florida obtained a waiver to pilot the provision of housing support services for adult Medicaid beneficiaries with severe mental illness and substance use disorders who are homeless or at risk for homelessness ([Florida Agency for Health Care Administration 2016](#ch2.ref165)).\n\n#### [Figure 19](/books/NBK578297/figure/ch2.fig19/?report=objectonly)\n\nNational Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) domain framework.\n\nEvidence-based dental practice initiatives aimed at improving the quality of care have grown steadily in recent years. Professional organizations are leading the way in developing clinical practice guidelines aimed at bringing the best evidence into the hands of clinicians in ways that facilitate application in routine clinical practice. The American Dental Association is a leader in this area, having supported development of a number of important guidelines related to prevention, conservative dental caries management, and appropriate antibiotic use, among others. See [Section 4](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/), [Table 8](/books/n/nidcroralhealth/ch7/table/ch7.tab8/?report=objectonly) for more information.\n\n### Oral Health and Public Health Emergencies Planning\n\nPublic health emergencies can arise at any time from natural or man-made disasters and could have a serious impact on a community\u2019s oral health. Although the magnitude and severity of the impact on oral health can vary greatly, these emergencies often affect the more vulnerable, who already experience poor oral health and who are dependent, to the greatest extent, on the health care safety net. In the United States, preparing for these disasters requires substantial planning, investment, and ongoing discourse at federal, state, and local levels.\n\nPreparedness can take many forms, ranging from addressing financial loss to providing health care ([Kim-Farley 2017](#ch2.ref273)). A key barrier to health care preparedness typically is a lack of coordination across the spectrum of public health and health care communities and disciplines ([Markenson et al. 2005](#ch2.ref317)). An example of a community overcoming numerous coordination barriers to include oral health care in emergency preparedness and response is Fulton County, Georgia, where the county health department includes oral health providers in planning for and responding to public health emergencies ([Box 3](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box3/?report=objectonly)).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the necessity of having health care infrastructure and policy preparedness plans in place to successfully cope with widespread infectious illness across the country. Pandemics reveal inequities in health care access and availability that increase already existing health disparities in vulnerable communities and populations. Just as the HIV/AIDS epidemic forever changed infection control standards and guidelines in dentistry to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens ([Kohn et al. 2003](#ch2.ref279)), COVID-19 may change infection control practices to control the spread of respiratory diseases among dental health care workers and patients. Many dental procedures generate large amounts of droplets and aerosols, which have been shown to be capable of carrying the coronavirus implicated in COVID-19 ([Anderson et al. 2020](#ch2.ref30); [Ge et al. 2020](#ch2.ref178)). Most dental care facilities have not been designed to practice using airborne precautions, and few dental health care workers had prior experience with respirators before the onset of the pandemic. Clinical recommendations and guidelines are rapidly changing to address the new reality, and there is a strong possibility that long-term standards will establish administrative and engineering controls for aerosols. The increasing frequency of disease outbreaks attributable to viruses in recent years suggests that reduction and control of aerosols and droplets may become a permanent practice in the provision of oral health care.\n\n### Oral Health and National Security\n\nA promising new direction in military oral health care is being adopted by the Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). It includes the modernization and integration of EHRs, which will allow service members to maintain the same record when transitioning care from DoD to VA. This will give health care providers a full picture of a patient\u2019s history since their start of active duty and will help identify those at increased risk for other issues, such as opioid addiction ([U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 2018](#ch2.ref526)).\n\nTo facilitate global continuity of care for service members by leveraging telecommunication and information technologies and collaborating with colleagues from the other services and the Defense Health Agency, the Navy is developing and testing a dental virtual health infrastructure ([U.S. Department of the Navy 2019](#ch2.ref525)).\n\nThe Army is exploring incorporation of advanced information technology, such as voice recognition dictation, dental diagnostic coding, and electronic dental records, which could improve efficiency and quality of patient care by allowing rapid creation of a searchable dental record. Advances in nanotechnology could expand the use of salivary diagnostics beyond disease testing to real-time biometric monitoring of soldiers\u2019 physiologic function and hydration status ([National Institutes of Health 2010](#ch2.ref368)).\n\nThe greatest impact on soldier wellness and readiness, however, would be accomplished with new methods to prevent or diagnose the root cause of more than half of all dental treatment needs and dental emergencies\u2014dental caries. New technologies that allow for reliable and valid caries detection by nondental personnel would be of great value for screening, particularly in areas where dental professionals are not readily available. This would facilitate triage and referral for prevention or disease management interventions. An antiplaque peptide developed by the Army Institute for Surgical Research has demonstrated efficacy against biofilm-producing microorganisms and was recently incorporated into a chewing gum formulation to determine if it can prevent dental caries ([Al-Ghananeem et al. 2017](#ch2.ref9)). The restoration of deeply cavitated carious lesions using minimally invasive treatment techniques and bioactive materials has the potential to preserve tooth structure, extend the retention and function of soldiers\u2019 natural dentition, and possibly help to manage urgent care needs in remote environments ([Zhang et al. 2012](#ch2.ref580); [Schwendicke 2018](#ch2.ref453); [Aro et al. 2019](#ch2.ref33); [Pappa et al. 2019](#ch2.ref392)).\n\n### Box 3How does a community include oral health care in emergency preparedness and response?\n\nHurricanes and other emergency events can create serious challenges to receiving oral health care, particularly for vulnerable individuals. Including oral health professionals in planning for and responding to emergencies has created opportunities to improve access to care for residents of Fulton County, Georgia, and neighboring counties. While assessing the immediate health needs of persons moved to a temporary shelter during a hurricane, a dentist member of the local unit of the Medical Reserve Corps noticed that the health intake questionnaire did not include questions about oral pain or dental problems. Moreover, the membership of the local unit included physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and veterinarians but almost no dentists. Recognizing that dentists, with their advanced knowledge of oral health in the context of overall heath, could play an important role in emergency preparedness and response, the Fulton County Board of Health began recruiting dentists in 2019 to join their local Medical Reserve Corps. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020\u20132021, an additional group of 40 oral surgeons and dentists quickly stepped forward to join the Medical Reserve Corps to develop protocols for swab tests, administer diagnostic tests, and provide vaccinations. In another example of the county\u2019s response to an emergency that threatened access to oral health care in an adjacent county, Fulton County and Clayton County entered into a co-location of services agreement. When the Clayton County dental facility had to be closed because of mold, its staff relocated to a dental facility already operating in Fulton County. In the first 6 months of operation, 300 at-risk children from Clayton County received oral health services at the Fulton County facility. This collaboration marks the first time that two districts in Georgia have operated under a co-location of services agreement.\n\n## Chapter 4. Summary\n\nThere are several issues that influence oral health beyond the clinical realm in which dentists and their patients typically interact. By considering broad epidemiological, systemic, and policy perspectives and examining the best available data, it can be more clear where oral health is improving and where there is a continued need for concern and action ([Box 4](/books/NBK578297/box/ch2.box4/?report=objectonly)).\n\nMany improvements in oral health have occurred in the past 2 decades. The prevalence of major oral diseases is declining. Access to care for low-income children has improved remarkably as a result of Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program reform and, more recently, for low-income adults through Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Despite ongoing improvements in oral health, poor oral health continues to be highly prevalent and remains a major concern for many Americans. For example, since the release of the last Surgeon General\u2019s report on oral health in 2000, the current patchwork of dental care financing continues to create major gaps in access to affordable dental care for many vulnerable groups. These same groups tend to suffer disproportionate levels of dental disease, with little hope of obtaining needed care. Having large segments of society suffer from persistent untreated oral disease creates economic and societal costs that harm individuals, families, communities, and national security.\n\nA new understanding has emerged that the causes of poor oral health are the result of complex interactions of determinants from many levels, including socioeconomic conditions and the food and beverage industries\u2019 targeting of vulnerable populations with sugary or low-nutrition food items. The result is unacceptable disparities in oral health among population groups. Although these distal health determinants have previously been recognized in some form or another, they are now identified in the conceptually, empirically, and policy unifying language of the social and commercial determinants of health.\n\n### Box 4Key summary messages for the Effect of Oral Health on the Community, Overall Weil-Being, and the Economy\n\n* Good oral health supports overall health and well-being of individuals, families, communities, and the nation.\n* Based on economic and social factors, some groups experience more disease and more barriers to care than the general population; the result is unacceptable, but reversible, inequities in oral health.\n* Commercial interests play a dual role in affecting oral health, providing excellent products that support oral health, as well as products, such as tobacco and sugar-sweetened foods snd beverages, that are detrimental to oral health.\n* Lack of access to regular dental care can result in ineffective and expensive overuse of emergency departments.\n* Poor oral health reduces the economic productivity of society by limiting participation in the workforce, as well as by increasing health care costs.\n* Untreated oral disease can postpone entry to military service or delay deployment of troops to active duty, thus jeopardizing the nation\u2019s military readiness.\n* Natural disasters, the emergence of novel pathogens, such as COVID-19, and other large-scale emergencies underscore the need for public-private partnerships that plan and ensure the continued delivery of essential oral health care in times of crisis.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\n* Policy changes are needed to reduce inequities in oral health status and care, ensuring that all Americans can enjoy the benefits of good oral health.\n\nLack of access to dental care continues to be a barrier to good oral health, especially among poor and rural communities, and has led to the increased use of emergency departments and urgent care facilities that can only provide palliative, not comprehensive, care.\n\nAs a consequence of these developments, policy reform is urgently needed to resolve the structural barriers that allow oral disease and oral disease inequities to persist. This requires that attention be directed toward social and commercial determinants that discourage healthy behavior and nutritional choices and fail to guarantee access to care for all. The benefits of these reforms will more than justify the costs. However, these policy actions will be politically challenging because they are embedded in larger debates about social and economic organization and will require us to engage in highly sensitive conversations about the ways in which historical, and still broadly based, biases create structural racism even in social and health care systems that are intended to support the well-being of all.\n\nFortunately, compared to 20 years ago, there is better understanding of where remedies are needed. Improved models of disease etiology have identified many new targets for public health and public policy interventions. Increased understanding of the importance of social determinants of health and the common risk factor approach provides a strong rationale for more upstream solutions. There is a broadening consensus that health care practices and patient outcomes would benefit from greater dental and medical integration. The technology infrastructure also is available to support that integration. The growing emphasis on quality metrics and value-based payments is prompting more emphasis on evidence-based practices, health literacy, patient-centered care, and population health outcomes. There also is compelling evidence that was not available 20 years ago that oral health conditions in the population have an economic cost in terms of employability and lost school days.\n\nLooking forward, it is clear that a variety of stakeholders have important roles to play. Policymakers should understand the importance of oral health to individuals, families, and communities and recognize its importance in overall well-being. Significant human suffering and economic costs arise from dental policy neglect. All health care professionals should understand that oral health IS health and that they each have a vital role to play in helping individuals stay healthy. Alongside dental associations and other professional and advocacy groups, all health professions should have the opportunity to advance health promotion and oral health policy.\n\nThere is no question that high-quality dental services are routinely delivered in dental offices every day to a majority of Americans. However, significant numbers of Americans are unable to access this care. Approaches that include care outside of the dental office\u2014in places such as nursing homes, schools, and community health centers\u2014should be considered to ensure full access to everyone with oral health care needs. Further, providers and educators must communicate to members of their communities an understanding of the value of oral health and provide incentives for engaging in the healthy behaviors that will help to avoid chronic diseases or to assist in managing them. Most importantly, dentists, other oral health and health care professionals, insurers, and legislators need to understand that healthy behaviors are best achieved by improving social and living conditions and providing equal opportunity to live a good life. None of this is easy, but all of it is necessary to achieve a just and equitable system of health care that provides for everyone\u2019s needs, including the experience of good oral health.\n\n## References\n\n* 110th United States Congress.

Despite the advent of more effective multimodal chemotherapies and novel surgical techniques, outcomes remain poor. This is largely attributed to delay in diagnosis given only one in every five patients has resectable disease at the time of presentation. Social determinants of health, namely economic stability, education, race, and insurance status, also play an important role in cancer-related outcomes. Initiatives to address the disparities in pancreatic cancer care target one or more social determinants. These initiatives focus on expanding access to quality multidisciplinary care for all patients with pancreatic cancer regardless of cost, insurance status, education level, and race.\n\n**Keywords:** pancreatic cancer, social determinants\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)Abstract\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Background/Objectives**: Pancreatic cancer treatment is complex and requires involvement of multidisciplinary care teams. Despite the aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer and its poor survival rate, outcomes are often determined by whether patients can establish care and receive guideline-concordant treatment. Social determinants of health impact access to care and provide an explanation for the variability seen in treatment and outcomes across patients of different backgrounds. This review will focus on the impact of these social determinants in the United States, raise awareness, and propose actionable changes that have potential to positively impact pancreatic cancer care. **Methods**: A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to assess the impact of social determinants of health, particularly socioeconomic status, insurance status, race, and educational level, on disparities in pancreatic cancer care. **Results**: Financial insecurity, lack of insurance, low educational attainment, and minority race are associated with delays in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, lower likelihood of treatment at high-volume centers, reduced access to surgical resection and chemoradiation, and worse outcomes. Efforts to address disparities should target improving patient experiences and expanding access to treatment at the individual patient level and system-wide. Potential measures include utilizing patient navigators and community health workers, simplifying patient communication, and facilitating cancer care at high-volume multidisciplinary centers. **Conclusions**: Socioeconomic status, insurance status, race, and educational level influence the entire pancreatic cancer care continuum from diagnosis to outcomes after treatment.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)1. Introduction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith a rising annual incidence, pancreatic cancer is now the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in American men and women [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B1-cancers-17-01898)]. Despite the advent of more effective multi-agent chemotherapies and innovative surgical strategies that have increased surgical candidacy, the 5-year survival rate remains poor at approximately 13% [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B2-cancers-17-01898),[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B3-cancers-17-01898),[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B4-cancers-17-01898),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B5-cancers-17-01898)]. This poor survival rate can be explained by both the lack of available screening tests and the often-asymptomatic nature of pancreatic cancer resulting in advanced disease at diagnosis.\n\nDespite generally poor outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), significant disparities exist across patients from diverse backgrounds. Optimizing outcomes in PDAC requires complex, multidisciplinary care, making delays in treatment and barriers to accessing care particularly consequential. Several social determinants exacerbate these challenges and worsen the already dismal outcomes in patients with PDAC. The most impactful of the social determinants include socioeconomic status (SES), education, race, and insurance status [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B6-cancers-17-01898)]. These social elements are interconnected and perpetuate disparities because patients who face structural barriers will persistently be unable to access the resources needed to optimize their health, despite medical advancements. Social factors influence everything from health behaviors to healthcare utilization. While SES, education, race, and insurance status may be upstream from cancer care, they inevitably affect treatment and outcomes [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B7-cancers-17-01898),[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B8-cancers-17-01898)]. Inequalities can manifest as delays in diagnosis and treatment or the receipt of substandard treatment, which can ultimately affect outcomes. This narrative review aims to summarize and synthesize the current literature on the impact that social determinants have on pancreatic cancer care and further highlight tangible target areas for improvement that may lead to better outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)2. Materials and Methods\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA narrative review was conducted to synthesize the evidence on the impact of social determinants of health on pancreatic cancer care in the United States. The methodology was guided by principles of transparency and replicability, based on the PRISMA statement [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B9-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nArticles were identified via PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase on 9 February 2025, using the keywords \u201cpancreatic cancer\u201d and \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d and MeSH terms \u201cCarcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal\u201d and \u201cSocioeconomic Disparities in Health\u201d. Studies related to non-pancreatic gastrointestinal cancers, performed outside the United States, or including qualitative data were excluded. To ensure comprehensiveness, references from relevant studies were reviewed for additional sources.\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nStudies were included if they examined the impact of one or more SDOH on any aspect of pancreatic cancer care. Exclusion criteria included the following: studies focused on non-pancreatic cancers; those conducted outside the United States; conference abstracts, editorials, or non-peer-reviewed publications; and non-English studies.\n\nStudy Selection\n\nThe search yielded 208 records. After removal of duplicate studies, two reviewers (SNP and JRH) independently screened 10% titles and abstracts against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. One reviewer (SNP) screened the remaining studies following the rapid review methodology [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B10-cancers-17-01898),[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B11-cancers-17-01898)]. Any discrepancies were subsequently resolved through discussion. Full-text articles (n = 141) were retrieved and assessed for eligibility, resulting in 98 studies included in the final review. PRISMA flow diagram ([Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#cancers-17-01898-f001)) illustrates the selection process.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Image 9: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/16e9/12191349/4b6380d9ac9c/cancers-17-01898-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12191349_cancers-17-01898-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/figure/cancers-17-01898-f001/)\n\nPRISMA flow diagram of selection process for reviewed studies.\n\nAssessment of Study Quality\n\nThe validated Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS) instrument for observational studies was employed to assess study quality. This tool evaluates scored studies based on selection (0\u20134), comparability (0\u20132), and ascertainment of exposure/outcome (0\u20133) [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B12-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nGiven that the reviewed studies not only utilized differing methodologies but also relied on different datasets, their findings are incommensurable. Therefore, when interpreting and combining findings of the reviewed papers, a qualitative approach was required in which two reviewers (SNP and JRH) considered a host of factors including sample size, validity, generalizability, relevance, and statistical significance of reported findings.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)3. Results\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOut of the studies reviewed (n = 98), the majority of studies included were observational (82%) and the remainder were review articles (12%) or prospective trials (6%). The average year of publication was 2020 and the median and mode year was 2022. Notably, the earliest year of publication for a reviewed study was 2005, with only five studies published prior to 2015. Using the NOS instrument to assess study quality, all observational studies were scored as moderate or good.\n\n### 3.1. Socioeconomic Status\n\nSocioeconomic status (SES), a measure of one\u2019s combined social and economic status, is known to influence health outcomes [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B13-cancers-17-01898)]. With respect to cancer, financial stability not only determines what kinds of treatments patients have access to but also contributes to lived environments that make patients more or less vulnerable to developing cancer and experiencing progression. In pancreatic cancer, multiple studies have shown that socioeconomic factors, such as income, housing stability, employment, and food insecurity, can adversely impact delivery of treatment and thus outcomes [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B8-cancers-17-01898),[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B14-cancers-17-01898),[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B15-cancers-17-01898),[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B16-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nFor patients with resectable PDAC, financial insecurity is associated with lower odds of receiving neoadjuvant and multimodal therapy [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B14-cancers-17-01898)]. Patients with low SES with localized disease are less likely to undergo surgery and are more likely to be lost to follow-up after resection compared to patients of higher SES [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B15-cancers-17-01898),[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B16-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, patients of low SES experience significant delays in treatment (OR 1.22, 95% CI [1.10\u20131.34], _p_< 0.05) and are ultimately less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy after resection (OR 1.30, 95% CI [1.20\u20131.41], _p_< 0.05) [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B17-cancers-17-01898)]. Given that surgical resection is the only chance for cure, and that adjuvant chemotherapy after resection prolongs survival, these patients often do not receive standard-of-care treatment [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B18-cancers-17-01898)]. Overall survival after surgery is significantly worse in patients of lower SES compared to patients of higher SES (median OS of 20.0 months for high SES vs. median OS of 17.0 months for low SES; _p_< 0.001) [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B8-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, achievement of a textbook outcome (TO) after surgery (absence of postoperative surgical complications, prolonged length of stay, 90-day readmission, and 90-day mortality) is significantly less likely in patients of lower SES (OR of achieving TO in high SES = 0.94, 95% CI [0.87\u20131.0] vs. OR of achieving TO in low SES = 0.89, 95% CI [0.82\u20130.97]) [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B19-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nSES is also a driving factor of the kind of treatment center that patients with PDAC can access. This is important, as treatment at high-volume centers (HVCs), defined as those performing at least 20 pancreatectomies per year, is associated with fewer perioperative complications, superior lymph node yield, higher rates of chemotherapy delivery, shorter lengths of stay, and longer overall survival [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B20-cancers-17-01898),[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B21-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, patients treated at non-academic and low-volume centers (LVCs) experience treatment delays on the order of days. While delaying treatment initiation by days may seem inconsequential, ideally, pancreatic cancer treatment should be delivered expeditiously given delays may influence treatment options and thus patient prognosis [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B22-cancers-17-01898)]. When patients are initially diagnosed and treated at an LVC, subsequent referral to a HVC leads to improved outcomes (OS of LVC referred to HVC for locoregional disease = 16.6 months, 95% CI [15.3\u201317.9] vs. OS of LVC only for locoregional disease = 8.2 months, 95% CI [7.7\u20138.7], _p_< 0.001) [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B23-cancers-17-01898)]. However, patients of lower SES are ultimately even less likely to be referred to high-volume centers after initial presentation [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B23-cancers-17-01898),[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B24-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nRural patients of lower SES are at a particular disadvantage as they often live far from the nearest hospital [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B25-cancers-17-01898)]. Rural residence is thus an independent predictor of later stage of PDAC at diagnosis, which is unsurprisingly exacerbated by sparse primary care networks in these areas [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B26-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, traveling for pancreatic cancer treatment is not inconsequential as traveling >12.5 miles for resection is associated with worse overall survival. Patients experience worse outcomes when traveling to receive care at academic centers that perform fewer than 20 pancreatectomies per year compared to traveling to receive care at centers that perform these operations more frequently [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B24-cancers-17-01898),[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B27-cancers-17-01898)]. Thus, patients of lower socioeconomic status residing in rural areas are particularly susceptible to experiencing shorter overall survival after resection of pancreatic cancer (5-year rural OS 18.8%, 95% CI [17.4\u201320.2%] vs. 5-year urban OS 22.3%, 95% CI [21.6\u201322.9%], _p_< 0.0001) [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B28-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nFood insecurity is a known direct consequence of socioeconomic adversity as households with lower income are more likely to be food insecure [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B29-cancers-17-01898)]. An analysis of the impact of food insecurity on outcomes of patients with hepatobiliary cancers who underwent surgical resection found that patients who lived in counties with higher food insecurity were more likely to experience perioperative complications and be at higher risk of 90-day mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI [0.54\u20130.88], _p_ = 0.003) [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B30-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nIn culmination, median overall survival for PDAC is associated with ~6 month longer survival for patients of high SES compared to those of low SES for all stages of PDAC except metastatic disease, likely due to the universally poor outcomes observed when pancreatic cancer spreads to other organs (median OS low SES = 14.1 months, 95% CI [13.4\u201314.8] vs. median OS high SES 20.2 months, 95% CI [19.6\u201320.8]) [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B31-cancers-17-01898),[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B32-cancers-17-01898)].\n\n### 3.2. Insurance Status\n\nA lack of health insurance is a known barrier to receiving cancer care in the United States. The uninsured are disadvantaged at every stage of workup and management and are more likely to present with advanced cancer at diagnosis [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B33-cancers-17-01898)]. Insurance type also has important implications. For example, cancer patients with Medicare or Medicaid suffer worse outcomes and reduced survival compared to those who are privately insured (pancreatic cancer; Medicare and Medicaid insured vs. privately insured HR: Stage I = 2.86 95% CI [2.14\u20133.82], Stage 2 = 1.72, 95% CI [1.50\u20131.99], Stage 3 = 1.00, 95% CI [0.81\u20131.24], Stage 4 = 1.59, 95% CI [1.43\u20131.77]) [[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B34-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nIn pancreatic cancer, health insurance status correlates with disease burden at diagnosis. Accordingly, uninsured patients are more often diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at later stages, rendering them unresectable [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B6-cancers-17-01898),[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B35-cancers-17-01898),[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B36-cancers-17-01898)]. Large database studies underscore this finding, demonstrating that private health insurance significantly decreases a patient\u2019s likelihood of being diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer (private vs. no insurance = OR 0.72, 95% CI [0.67\u20130.74]) [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B37-cancers-17-01898)]. Policies that have sought to improve access to health insurance, such as Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, have resulted in earlier stage at diagnosis for Medicaid or uninsured pancreatic cancer patients (stage I/II, difference in differences = 4.71, _p_ = 0.03) [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B38-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, patients in states with Medicaid expansion have superior operative outcomes and overall survival compared to those residing in states without Medicaid expansion (HR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.73\u20130.90; _p_< 0.001) [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B39-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nUninsured or publicly insured patients do not receive the same degree of treatment for pancreatic cancer compared to their insured counterparts. Private insurance is associated with more treatment, regardless of the treatment modality (OR = 1.41; _p_< 0.001) [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B40-cancers-17-01898)]. Alternatively, patients who lack health insurance or on Medicaid are significantly less likely to receive neoadjuvant (uninsured: OR = 0.55 95% CI [0.36\u20130.85], _p_< 0.01) and multimodal therapy (uninsured: OR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.42\u20130.79], _p_< 0.01; Medicaid: OR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.44\u20130.65] _p_< 0.001) [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B14-cancers-17-01898),[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B41-cancers-17-01898)]. This is particularly alarming considering access to these treatments may not only help control systemic disease but are also critical in increasing surgical candidacy in patients with locally advanced cancer [[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B42-cancers-17-01898)]. For those with resectable PDAC, having private insurance is also a predictor of undergoing surgery [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B6-cancers-17-01898)] while uninsured patients undergo resection at significantly lower rates (OR = 0.07, 95% CI [0.01\u20130.49]) [[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B43-cancers-17-01898)]. Further, when patients that are publicly insured undergo pancreatoduodenectomy for PDAC, they have a significantly longer length of stay (LOS) (8 versus 7 days, _p_ = 0.021) and are more likely to experience postoperative complications compared to those that are privately insured [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B19-cancers-17-01898),[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B44-cancers-17-01898)]. Patients with Medicare (OR 1.660; 95% CI 1.123\u20132.454) or private insurance (OR 1.597; 95% CI 1.090\u20132.340) are more likely to undergo minimally invasive surgical resection [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B45-cancers-17-01898)]. Taken together, insurance coverage significantly increases the likelihood of undergoing surgical resection in multiple patient cohorts, a mandatory prerequisite for potential cure.\n\n### 3.3. Educational Background\n\nHigher educational attainment is associated with a healthier lifestyle and prolonged survival [[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B46-cancers-17-01898)]. Not only does educational achievement create a pathway towards employment and financial security that allows individuals to access superior healthcare, but it also encourages engagement in healthier behaviors that may decrease susceptibility to a variety of diseases [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B47-cancers-17-01898)]. For example, cigarette smoking is a known modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer that is associated with increased incidence of PDAC and worse outcomes [[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B48-cancers-17-01898),[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B49-cancers-17-01898),[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B50-cancers-17-01898)]. Individuals with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to smoke cigarettes and be less successful in attempts to quit [[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B51-cancers-17-01898)]. Though the underlying etiology of pancreatic cancer is multifactorial, the relationship between smoking and education level is pertinent, as efforts to expand access to education have the potential to reduce engagement in unhealthy behaviors that contribute to the development of this deadly cancer.\n\nIn PDAC, education level also impacts the timing of when patients receive treatment, what treatments are offered, and how patients navigate available therapeutic options. Completing higher education is associated with initiating treatment earlier than those with lower levels of educational attainment (for population quartile with the lowest percentage of patients without a high school degree compared to the quartile with the highest percentage: HR 1.09; _p_< 0.001) [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B40-cancers-17-01898)]. Furthermore, lower education level is associated with lower likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant care across all stages of pancreatic cancer (percentage of patients receiving guideline-concordant care in most educated vs. least educated quartile: 26.8% vs. 15.1%, _p_< 0.001) [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B52-cancers-17-01898)]. There is also an association between high school completion and the hospital setting in which patients seek surgical excision. Those that have graduated high school are more likely to be treated at academic medical centers when undergoing surgery, where perioperative outcomes are superior (percentage receiving surgery at academic centers in highest proportion of high school graduates vs. lowest proportion of high school graduates: 26.9% vs. 16.2%, _p_< 0.001) [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B40-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nHealth literacy parallels educational level. Achieving a higher educational level is associated with a greater ability to digest and act on health information [[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B53-cancers-17-01898)]. Patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are typically presented with multimodal treatment options that are complex and often unfamiliar. Lower health literacy is associated with communication difficulties, as patients may struggle to understand written materials and conversations with their providers. This limits patient engagement and negatively impacts shared decision-making [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B54-cancers-17-01898)]. Patients with greater degrees of health literacy want to actively participate in surgical decision-making in premalignant lesions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms that can progress to pancreatic cancer [[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B55-cancers-17-01898)]. Therefore, improving health literacy has the potential to empower pancreatic cancer patients to engage with their providers and actively participate in their cancer care. Cancer patients with more active roles are more satisfied with their care and can have better health outcomes [[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B56-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nOverall, level of educational attainment is an important mediator of how patients with pancreatic cancer establish care, receive treatment, and navigate recovery after undergoing surgical resection or receiving multimodal therapy.\n\n### 3.4. Race\n\nThe incidence of PDAC is reported to be 50\u201390% higher in Black patients than other racial groups [[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B57-cancers-17-01898)]. In terms of baseline characteristics, queries into the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database have shown Black patients are generally younger than White patients at the time of diagnosis [[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B58-cancers-17-01898),[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B59-cancers-17-01898)]. Observational data has also shown that in Black patients, stage of PDAC at diagnosis is also more advanced [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B60-cancers-17-01898)]. Poulson and colleagues looked more granularly at race distribution across neighborhoods and disparities in pancreatic cancer. Their analysis of the SEER database found that Black patients living in more segregated neighborhoods are more likely to present at an advanced stage than White patients living in the least segregated neighborhoods (RR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.08\u20131.15]). Notably, their study did not control for other social determinants of health, such as income, insurance status, educational achievement, and employment status [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B36-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nDespite being diagnosed at a later stage, a National Cancer Database analysis that adjusts for SES suggests that Black patients also tend to obtain less overall treatment (OR = 0.97, _p_ = 0.04) and experience more treatment delays (HR = 0.89, _p_< 0.001) [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B40-cancers-17-01898)]. Across all stages of pancreatic cancer, when adjusting for other social determinants, it has been observed that amongst patients who did not receive standard-of-care treatment, a significantly higher percentage were Black compared to patients who did receive standard-of-care treatment (12.6% vs. 11.4%, _p_< 0.001) [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B52-cancers-17-01898)]. This disparity is observed regardless of the type of treatment, as Black patients are receiving less chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery for pancreatic cancer [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B40-cancers-17-01898)]. Given that radical surgical resection is the only curative treatment currently available, it is worth noting that even when Black patients are diagnosed with localized disease amenable to resection, they are less likely to undergo surgery (RR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.83\u20130.94]) [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B36-cancers-17-01898)]. An SEER study provides a potential explanation for these disparities as, when compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to establish care with medical oncologists (AA 56.2% vs. white 60.2%, _p_< 0.001), radiation oncologists (AA 25.6% vs. white 32.5%, _p_< 0.05), and surgeons (AA 72.1% vs. white 78%, _p_ = 0.01) [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B6-cancers-17-01898)]. An analysis of patients with resected PDAC in New York state from 2007\u20132017 also found that Black patients were more likely to undergo surgery at low-volume centers (OR 2.21, 95% CI: [1.69\u20132.88]) [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B22-cancers-17-01898)]. Interestingly, this study also found Black (50.4%) and White (52.6%) patients received significantly less surveillance imaging after resection compared to patients of Asian (73.9%) or Hispanic (61.9%) race/ethnicity (_p_ = 0.01) [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B22-cancers-17-01898)]. When adjusting for other social determinants, surgeons appear to be less likely to recommend resection for Black patients (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: [0.82\u20130.95]) compared to comparably staged cancers in White patients (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: [0.76\u20130.91]) [[61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B61-cancers-17-01898)]. Further, as minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques become increasingly utilized by pancreatic surgeons, not all patients with pancreatic cancer are undergoing MIS resections equally. Black patients are more likely than White patients to undergo open surgical resections rather than robotic or laparoscopic resections (OR = 0.82; 95% CI: [0.70\u20130.96]) [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B45-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nOf note, Black patients are significantly more likely to decline treatments offered to them for pancreatic cancer whether it is chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Refusal of treatment amongst minority patients is seen across other malignancies and is attributable to multiple factors including mistrust of the medical establishment and suboptimal provider communication [[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B62-cancers-17-01898),[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B63-cancers-17-01898),[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B64-cancers-17-01898)]. With respect to exposure to novel treatment approaches via clinical trial participation, Black patients are more likely to be ineligible to participate when compared to White patients, and their exclusion is typically related to comorbidities such as renal or cardiac dysfunction and HIV, Hep B/C positive status rather than prior cancer treatment such as receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (percentage of Black patients ineligible 42.4% vs. percentage of White patients ineligible 33.2%, _p_ = 0.023) [[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B65-cancers-17-01898)]. Even as overall enrollment in pancreatic cancer clinical trials increases, Black patients remain underrepresented [[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B66-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nMany of the disparities observed in Black patients with pancreatic cancer can also be seen in Hispanic patients. A retrospective analysis of patients with pancreatic cancer treated at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive center in Arizona found that Hispanic patients with early-stage PDAC present at a younger age compared to non-Hispanic patients (median age at diagnosis for Hispanic patients 60.7 yrs vs. 66.7 yrs in non-Hispanic patients, _p_ = 0.03) [[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B67-cancers-17-01898)]. Another study looking at data from the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County (California) and the San Diego Imperial Organization for Cancer Control found that, when compared to all other races, Hispanic patients were the most likely to receive no treatment regardless of stage (Hispanic = 56.9%, non-Hispanic white = 52.1%, African American = 52.0%, Asian = 48.6%) [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B60-cancers-17-01898)]. Further, Hispanic patients undergoing surgical resection are less likely to travel to receive treatment at academic programs (APs) where there are lower rates of perioperative complications (69% had surgery at an AP versus 76% of non-Hispanic patients, _p_< 0.001) [[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B68-cancers-17-01898)]. Notably, patients of Hispanic origin are least likely to undergo MIS (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic, OR = 0.24, 95% CI [0.07\u20130.79], _p_ = 0.019) [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B6-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nDisparities in pancreatic cancer outcomes also exist amongst Asian American patients. Some of these differences may be attributed to cultural differences across this heterogeneous ethnic group. Forms of communication, including different dialects, healthcare-seeking behaviors, and strength of community bonds vary across the Asian diaspora [[69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B69-cancers-17-01898),[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B70-cancers-17-01898)]. These aspects have the potential to shape whether patients seek out and comply with treatment after diagnosis. Some Asian American patients also prescribe to alternative or \u201cEastern\u201d medicine practices. In cancer care, patients may only wish to receive alternative therapies and forgo conventional multimodal treatment regimens, which put patients at higher risk of poor outcomes [[71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B71-cancers-17-01898),[72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B72-cancers-17-01898),[73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B73-cancers-17-01898)]. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that Southeast Asians with pancreatic cancer are less likely to receive multimodal therapy and undergo surgical resection relative to all other Asian subgroups (chemotherapy: 28.7% vs. 32.1%, _p_< 0.001, radiation: 12.7% vs. 14.1%, _p_< 0.001, surgery: 21.4% vs. 23.8%, _p_< 0.001) [[74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B74-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nThe data remains sparse regarding outcomes and disparities in treatment for Native American patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. However, when American Indian or Alaskan Native patients reside in urban areas, their incidence rates of pancreatic cancer are significantly higher than those for non-Hispanic white patients living in the same areas (Native American: 26% vs. non-Hispanic white: 18%) [[75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B75-cancers-17-01898)].\n\nPatients of all racial backgrounds can experience language barriers when navigating healthcare in the United States. Roughly 26 million Americans have limited English proficiency (LEP), meaning English is not their primary language and they have a limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English [[76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B76-cancers-17-01898)]. Amongst those with LEP, the majority are Hispanic (62%) and over a fifth are Asian (22%) [[77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B77-cancers-17-01898)]. When patients have limited English proficiency (LEP) regardless of their racial background, their pancreatic cancer care may be impacted. A single-center retrospective study including 739 patients found that pancreatic cancer patients with LEP had significantly higher odds of death (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.03\u20132.47) in a matched analysis. Further, patients with LEP were more likely to present with advanced-stage cancer and had lower odds of receiving guideline-concordant treatment [[78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B78-cancers-17-01898)]. Another single-institution retrospective study analyzing registry data, albeit with a smaller cohort (n = 155), found that in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, LEP was not significantly associated with poorer overall survival (HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93\u20132.16, _p_ = 0.103) [[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B79-cancers-17-01898)]. The results of these studies suggest that, while efforts should be taken to adequately accommodate patients with LEP, further work is needed to sufficiently elucidate the relationship between English language proficiency and pancreatic cancer outcomes.\n\nOverall, the literature reviewed suggests that race is a pertinent factor in the treatment patients with pancreatic cancer receive and significantly affects patient outcomes. An exception to this may exist amongst patients with metastatic PDAC. A single-center study found that time to treatment after diagnosis was not significantly associated with racial disparities or differences in outcomes. However, this study included a majority White (82.9%) and high SES study population, which likely biased its conclusions [[80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B80-cancers-17-01898)]. To that end, while many of the aforementioned studies control for other social determinants, particularly income, insurance status, and education level, a key limitation of the literature in this area is the inconsistent examination of these other factors in addition to race. Thus, the studies that exclusively look at race with respect to PDAC treatment and outcomes risk overstating the role of race by ignoring confounding social determinants and limit the generalizability of their conclusions.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)4. Discussion and Future Directions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.1. Existing Theoretical Framework and Areas for Future Study\n\nDisparities in both care and outcomes exist for patients with PDAC across social determinants of health, including SES, degree of educational attainment, race, and insurance status in the United States. With the exception of race, these social determinants represent potentially modifiable risk factors with opportunities for improvement that can positively impact pancreatic cancer care. Given that our sourced articles originate from the United States, our article may not be generalized to other countries where access to healthcare and social dynamics differ.\n\nThe social determinants explored in our paper are not the only factors relevant in cancer care. Notably, gender differences, social support, caregiver involvement, community engagement, and immigration status are important determinants in cancer care worth mentioning. However, the literature significantly lacks a thorough discussion of how these factors inform pancreatic cancer care and outcomes. Gender differences have been shown to be significant in international studies looking at treatment allocation, survival by cancer stage, and outcomes in those with metastatic disease who received chemotherapy [[81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B81-cancers-17-01898),[82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B82-cancers-17-01898),[83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B83-cancers-17-01898)]. At present, there are no relevant domestic studies regarding gender differences in treatment allocation or outcomes in pancreatic cancer. In the case of social support, including both caregiver involvement and community engagement, the literature focuses primarily on caregiver burden and quality of life rather than how patients fare depending on their degree of social support [[84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B84-cancers-17-01898),[85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B85-cancers-17-01898),[86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B86-cancers-17-01898),[87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B87-cancers-17-01898),[88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B88-cancers-17-01898)]. Immigration status has been explored with respect to time to treatment in PDAC and was found to not be significantly associated with longer time to treatment after diagnosis [[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B89-cancers-17-01898)]. Future studies should seek to further explore these other patient factors with respect to pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhile we summarize the evidence on the impact of individual social determinants of health on various outcomes associated with pancreatic cancer, in reality, complex relationships between these determinants and the cancer care continuum contribute to observed disparities. A framework to understand these relationships developed by Alcaraz et al. considers how social and structural factors that are rooted in historic exclusion and discrimination inevitably produce environments that perpetuate inequality [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B7-cancers-17-01898)]. This can manifest as concentrated poverty, residential segregation, sparse public transportation systems, food deserts, failing school systems, and disproportionate exposure to pollution [[90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B90-cancers-17-01898)]. These environments then go on to not only reinforce structural and social injustice but also inform how patients ultimately navigate their cancer care [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B7-cancers-17-01898)]. Through healthcare delivery and quality, disparities in outcomes are ultimately observed as downstream consequences of social determinants of health.\n\nThe reviewed literature on social determinants in pancreatic cancer, particularly database studies, references individual factors such as educational level as proxies for social environment and social determinants. However, in doing so, the literature fails to account for the nuances that can exist between two individuals with the same degree of educational attainment. It is for this reason that an intersectional approach provides a wholistic framework through which pancreatic cancer care can be tailored to underserved populations [[91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B91-cancers-17-01898)]. Developed by critical race theorist Professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, intersectionality acknowledges that social determinants of health are not mutually exclusive and instead interact in complex ways [[91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B91-cancers-17-01898),[92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B92-cancers-17-01898)]. For patients with pancreatic cancer, considering identities such as religion, immigration status, and language proficiency during every phase of cancer care has the potential to improve health outcomes for underserved patients.\n\nIn recognizing the advantages of an intersectional approach to understanding how interlocking patient identities inform disparities, questions arise regarding how this methodology fits with modern quantitative research practices. Furthermore, as we begin to better understand how intersectional identities influence cancer care and thus outcomes, we must then ask ourselves how we can best evaluate initiatives meant to address disparate outcomes.\n\n### 4.2. Potential Interventions to Address Disparities\n\nThe following potential interventions to address disparities in cancer care include many that have only been shown to be effective in the context of malignancies other than pancreatic cancer. For these interventions, the literature lacks robust evidence for their effectiveness in reducing inequalities specifically in pancreatic cancer care. Thus, by presenting them here, we hope to encourage future work to look more closely at how their implementation can impact outcomes in pancreatic cancer.\n\nTreatment at multidisciplinary centers (MDCs) may have the power to mitigate the disparities faced by patients from disadvantaged backgrounds. A study by Hoehn and colleagues showed that treatment at an MDC can improve access to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, MIS, and outcomes after surgical resection. Accordingly, low SES patients treated at an MDC experienced improved survival [[93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B93-cancers-17-01898)]. Similarly, minority patients have better outcomes when treated at integrated health facilities such as academic centers [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B39-cancers-17-01898)]. An instructive example is the safety-net hospital, which provides patients with a means to receive multidisciplinary and integrated healthcare regardless of their ability to afford care. Sridhar et al. report that patients with PDAC treated at an urban safety-net hospital with a focus on vulnerable patient populations were able to achieve comparable outcomes to national averages [[89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B89-cancers-17-01898)]. Thus, to address disparities amongst patients with pancreatic cancer, a concerted effort to support existing safety-net hospitals and open more of these centers in lower socioeconomic areas may be beneficial. Making this long-term initiative a reality would require buy-in from local and federal government as well as existing healthcare facilities to ensure that patients are referred to multidisciplinary centers after diagnosis.\n\nTelemedicine allows patients to access care from the convenience of their homes. While treatment for PDAC necessitates either hospitalization or in-person visits, there is a role for virtual health in the post-treatment phase of the cancer continuum. Virtual visits can guide patients with exercise rehabilitation and nutritional optimization in the post-acute care setting. Telehealth programs designed for PDAC patients with a focus on rehabilitation and nutrition have demonstrated significant improvements in terms of quality of life and physical function regardless of cancer stage [[94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B94-cancers-17-01898)]. These programs may be of particular utility for patients residing in rural areas that must travel far distances to receive multidisciplinary care at academic centers. Healthcare providers are crucial stakeholders in expanding access to telemedicine. Their adoption of telemedicine in the short term can create long-term infrastructure within hospital systems for patients to access essential cancer care efficiently and conveniently.\n\nThe addition of patient navigators and community health workers to the care team is a means of addressing intersectional barriers in PDAC care. Patient navigation programs are community-based interventions aimed at providing individualized guidance for patients navigating their cancer care [[95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B95-cancers-17-01898)]. They are particularly effective at enhancing rates of initiation of and adherence to treatment in underserved patients with cancer [[96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B96-cancers-17-01898)]. When patient navigation is culturally tailored and educationally oriented, it not only improves adherence but also simultaneously improves a patient\u2019s understanding of their diagnosis [[97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B97-cancers-17-01898)]. For racial and ethnic minority groups that have experienced discrimination, medical mistrust is prevalent and contributes to undertreatment and undesirable outcomes [[98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B98-cancers-17-01898)]. Community health workers (CHWs) are entrusted individuals already integrated into the community that have been shown to improve adherence to screening for breast, cervical, and intestinal cancers amongst patients of ethnic minorities [[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B99-cancers-17-01898)]. A randomized control trial involving church-based CHWs showed Black patients who worked with CHWs were more adherent to screening protocols for colorectal cancer, suggesting that CHWs can successfully act as liaisons between patients and providers [[100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B100-cancers-17-01898)]. A similar model utilizing CHWs can be implemented for minority patients with PDAC to help engage these patients that may be hesitant to receive care. Creating programs that utilize both patient navigators and community health workers requires long-term investment from community institutions (i.e., churches, small businesses, etc.), healthcare systems, and providers who must work in tandem to ensure that patients are supported throughout their cancer care.\n\nGiven that education and health literacy are known determinants of outcomes for patients with PDAC, educational initiatives and efforts to simplify communication are worthwhile pursuits. For example, visual aids such as videos and animations can reach wide audiences and engage patients who may be alienated by purely written information. A retrospective study surveying viewers of Animated Pancreas Patient (APP) online modules found that participants reported significant knowledge gains and changes in their attitudes towards treatment after viewing the content [[101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B101-cancers-17-01898)]. In patients for whom English is not their primary language, simplified communications in the patient\u2019s native language have been shown to bridge disparities in other solid organ cancers and should thus be considered in PDAC [[102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B102-cancers-17-01898)]. Culturally sensitive smartphone applications have also been successful in providing patients with accessible at-home educational content and facilitating communication with their healthcare teams [[98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B98-cancers-17-01898),[99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B99-cancers-17-01898)]. A small trial including six patients with PDAC tested the use of a mobile application for daily symptom assessment and access to self-care advice in the first month after post-surgical resection discharge. The application also included real-time access to a nurse if alarming symptoms were experienced. Participants demonstrated ~80% adherence to daily symptom recording, suggesting similar apps are feasible for patients to use after discharge and enable patients to actively partake in their care when implemented [[103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B103-cancers-17-01898)]. However, like health literacy, digital literacy is an important consideration when utilizing smartphone-based interventions. Regardless of the format of educational initiatives or simplified communications, buy-in from healthcare providers is required to ensure that patients are made aware of these resources when navigating cancer care.\n\nExpanding access to health insurance also has the potential to improve equitable access to pancreatic cancer care. For example, a study looking at rates of resection before and after Massachusetts health insurance expansion in 2006 found that compared to control states where there was no change, Massachusetts had increased resection rates [[104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B104-cancers-17-01898)]. Improvements in disparities seen in states with Medicaid expansion compared to those without expansion is additional evidence that increasing insurance coverage is a powerful tool for improving the equity of pancreatic cancer care [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B38-cancers-17-01898)]. Improving access to health insurance requires investment from not only the state and federal government but also private insurance companies that have the power to make insurance more affordable and accessible for individuals that otherwise experience barriers to care.\n\nAs the landscape of pancreatic cancer research continues to change and increasingly novel treatment strategies become available, it is important that all patients benefit from this innovation. Many of the aforementioned strategies, such as employing patient navigators and community health workers, simplifying trial communications, and expanding Medicaid coverage of trial costs, have the potential to increase enrollment amongst patients of racial and ethnically minority backgrounds [[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#B66-cancers-17-01898)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)5. Conclusions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, pancreatic cancer care is impacted by social determinants of health including SES, insurance status, and educational attainment. Race also plays an important role; however, its effect in isolation is unclear given these social determinants are interconnected and influence every aspect of the cancer care continuum. Multiple possible interventions exist to address disparities and improve access to care for patients with PDAC ([Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/#cancers-17-01898-t001)). To address disparities driven by SES, increasing access to safety-net hospitals would allow patients to access high-quality cancer care regardless of their financial situation. Furthermore, strengthening referral networks to tertiary and quaternary safety-net hospitals, including those with academic affiliations, can expose underserved patients to a wider range of services. Incorporating telemedicine may also provide an alternative for patients who cannot afford to travel for frequent appointments. Medicaid expansion would help bridge the gaps in care experienced by uninsured patients. For patients with limited educational attainment, utilizing visual aids and smartphone apps to facilitate and simplify communication has been shown to improve health literacy. Additionally, employing patient navigators has the potential to individualize cancer care so patients can be guided based on their particular needs. These patient navigators and community health workers can even act as cultural liaisons to aid in the delivery of culturally competent care, thereby addressing difficulties faced by patients of different racial backgrounds. Finally, targeted interventions to recruit diverse study populations for clinical trials can improve access to novel treatments in pancreatic cancer for historically underrepresented minorities.\n\n### Table 1.\n\nSummary of social determinant related disparities and recommendations.\n\n| Social Determinants | Disparities | Possible Interventions |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| SES Race Education Level Insurance Status | Delayed diagnosis Delayed treatment Lack of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) Longer LOS Perioperative complications Decreased survival | Treatment at MDC Safety-net hospitals Telemedicine Patient navigators Community health workers Culturally competent care Simplified communication Expanding insurance access Broadening clinical trial eligibility |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/table/cancers-17-01898-t001/)\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)Abbreviations\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in this manuscript:\n\nPDAC Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\nSES Socioeconomic status\nMDC Multidisciplinary center\nCHW Community health worker\nLOS Length of stay\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/table/array1/)\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191349/)Author Contributions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConceptualization, S.N.P. and J.R.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.N.P., J.R.H. and G.D.S.; writing\u2014review and editing: S.N.P., J.R.H., D.B.H., M.D.K., K.M., A.A.J., C.L.W. and G.D.S.; supervision, G.D.S. and J.R.H.

Note 2: Ninety-eight percent of colon cancers are adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma subtypes. Note 3: Mixed histologies and specific variants or subtypes of adenocarcinoma other than mucinous/colloid or signet ring cell are rare. A less common combination is mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) 8244 (previously called adenocarcinoma and carcinoid). The new terminology was originally proposed for tumors arising from goblet cell carcinoid but with more aggressive adenocarcinoma histology. It was also proposed because carcinoids are a subgroup of neuroendocrine carcinoma. Pathologists may still diagnose adenocarcinoma and carcinoid, adenocarcinoid, or adenocarcinoma and a specific neuroendocrine tumor or adenocarcinoma arising from/with a NET (including specific types of NET-like goblet cell carcinoid). Over time, the histologic diagnoses will change to MANEC. Note 4: De novo (previously called frank) adenocarcinoma arises in the mucosa of the bowel, not in a polyp. Note 5: Terms Seen More Frequently: NET, NEC, GIST \u2022 NET (neuroendocrine tumor): The term NET is gradually replacing carcinoid; however, some pathologists still use the term carcinoid \u2022 NEC (neuroendocrine carcinoma): The term NEC includes small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma \u2022 GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor): o GISTs were originally thought to be smooth muscle tumors but are now thought to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal, neuro-regulatory cells in the GI tract. Prior to the implementation of an ICD-O-3 histology code for GISTs in 2001, they were reported as a GI sarcoma, usually leiomyosarcoma o GISTs are more common in the stomach (60%) and small intestine (30%), but 1-2% occur in the colon and 3% in the rectum o About a quarter of gastric GISTs are malignant o It is often difficult for the pathologist to determine the behavior of a GIST o GIST NOS becomes a reportable neoplasm beginning with cases diagnosed 1/1/2021 forward Note 6: Tables and rules refer to ICD-O rather than ICD-O-3. The version is not specified to allow for updates. Use the currently approved version of ICD-O. Note 7: 2007 MPH Rules and 2018 Solid Tumor Rules are used based on date of diagnosis. \u2022 Tumors diagnosed 01/01/2007 through 12/31/2017: Use 2007 MPH Rules Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 1 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Equivalent Terms and Definitions C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Multiple Primary Rules Jump to Histology Coding Rules \u2022 Tumors diagnosed 01/01/2018 and later: Use 2018 Solid Tumor Rules \u2022 The original tumor diagnosed before 1/1/2018 and a subsequent tumor diagnosed 1/1/2018 or later in the same primary site: Use the 2018 Solid Tumor Rules. Note 8: For those sites/histologies which have recognized biomarkers, the biomarkers are most frequently used to target treatment. Currently, there are clinical trials being conducted to determine whether these biomarkers can be used to identify multiple primaries and/or histologic type. Follow the Multiple Primary Rules; do not code multiple primaries based on biomarkers. Changes from 2007 MPH Rules These changes are effective with cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 and later. 1. 2007 Rules instruct \u201cCode the histology from the most representative specimen.\u201d For all sites except breast and CNS, 2018 Rules instruct \u201cCode the most specific histology from biopsy or resection. When there is a discrepancy between the biopsy and resection (two distinctly different histologies/different rows), code the histology from the most representative specimen (the greater amount of tumor).\u201d 2. Rectum and Rectosigmoid are now included with the Colon Rules. In the 2007 MPH Rules, they were included with Other Sites. 3. There are new multiple primary rules which address anastomotic recurrence. 4. Neuroendocrine tumors (formerly carcinoid) arising in the appendix are reportable for cases diagnosed 1/1/2015 and forward. 5. Rule clarification: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (accumulation of mucin-secreting tumor cells in the abdominal or pelvic cavity) now has a two-tiered system (WHO 2010) that classifies pseudomyxoma peritonei as either high-grade or low-grade (see below). Pseudomyxoma peritonei is usually associated with mucinous tumors of the appendix and is rarely associated with ovarian mucinous tumors. \u2022 High-grade pseudomyxoma peritonei is malignant /3 \u2022 Low-grade pseudomyxoma peritonei is not malignant /1 \u2022 See Histology Rules for coding instructions Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 2 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Equivalent Terms and Definitions C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Multiple Primary Rules Jump to Histology Coding Rules 6. There are dysplasias which have been assigned an in situ behavior code /2 in WHO and in the ICD-O Update. Despite becoming a /2, they are not reportable in the US. They are reportable in Canada. \u2022 Dysplasia was not collected in the past. If dysplasia is added to the database with the same code as in situ tumors, there will be a huge upsurge in the incidence of in situ neoplasms. The various agencies are looking for solutions to this issue. \u2022 There would be no way to separate the dysplasias from the in-situ neoplasms in the database, which would cause problems with surveillance (long-term studies) since the prognosis and probabilities of disease progression are different between an in-situ tumor and a dysplasia \u2022 Pathologists frequently use the term \u201csevere dysplasia\u201d or \u201chigh grade dysplasia\u201d in place of carcinoma in situ. Code CIS only if the pathologist expressly states \u201cCIS\u201d 7. Polyps are now disregarded when coding histology. For example, adenocarcinoma in an adenomatous polyp is coded as adenocarcinoma 8140. For the purposes of determining multiple primaries, tumors coded as adenocarcinoma in a polyp for pre-2018 cases should be treated as adenocarcinoma 8140. New codes/terms are identified by asterisks (*) in the histology table in the Terms and Definitions. New for 2022 1. Timing changes to rules M7 and M8: The timing for subsequent tumors at the anastomosis has changed from 24 months to 36 months. The change is effective for cases diagnosed beginning 1/1/2022 forward. For cases diagnosed 1/1/2018 through 12/31/2021, the timing rule remains at 24 months. 2. Low grade appendiceal neoplasm (LAMN) will become reportable effective for cases diagnosed 1/1/2022 forward. LAMN may be either in situ 8480/2 or malignant 8480/3 based on physician statement of behavior. LAMN diagnosed prior to 1/1/2022 are not reportable.

Polyps with adenocarcinoma and benign polyps will be present. Because there are many polyps, the pathologist does not examine every polyp. Note 2: In situ /2 and malignant /3 adenocarcinoma in polyps, malignancies with remnants of a polyp, as well as de novo (previously called frank) malignancies may be present in multiple segments of the colon or in both the colon and rectum. Polyposis may be present in other GI sites such as stomach (a de novo does not have to be present; all adenocarcinoma may be in polyps). Note 3: FAP is a genetic disease. The characteristics of FAP are numerous precancerous polyps in the colon and rectum when the patient reaches puberty. If not treated, the polyps typically become malignant. Patients often have total colectomies. Note 4: Multiple polyps in the colorectum is not equivalent to FAP. Note 5: Code primary site as follows: \u2022 Present in more than one segment of colon: C189 colon, NOS \u2022 Present in colon and rectosigmoid OR colon and rectum: C199 rectosigmoid junction \u2022 Present in colon and small intestine: C260 intestinal tract, NOS (there is no code for large and small bowel) Note: In addition to the colon and small intestine, FAP may also be present in the: \u2022 Stomach AND/OR \u2022 Rectosigmoid AND/OR \u2022 Rectum Example: The patient has a diagnosis of FAP.

Abstract multiple primaries. \u2022 Different NOS: Goblet cell carcinoid 8243/3 is a subtype of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma 8244/3; somatostatin-producing NET 8156/3 is a subtype of neuroendocrine tumor Grade 1 (G1) 8240/3. They are distinctly different histologies. Abstract multiple primaries. Rule M6 Abstract multiple primariesii when separate/non-contiguous tumors are on different rows in Table 1 in the Equivalent Terms and Definitions. Timing is irrelevant. Note: Each row in the table is a distinctly different histology. Rule M7 Abstract multiple primariesii when a subsequent tumor arises at the anastomotic site AND: \u2022 One tumor is a NOS and the other is a subtype/variant of that NOS OR \u2022 The subsequent tumor occurs greater than 36 months after original tumor resection OR Note: For cases diagnosed prior to 1/1/2022, the time interval is greater than 24 months. \u2022 The subsequent tumor arises in the mucosa (see illustration) Note: Bullet three does not apply to GIST. GISTs only start in the wall; never in the mucosa. Example: (For bullet 1: NOS and subtype/variant) The original tumor was adenocarcinoma NOS 8140. The patient had a hemicolectomy. There was a recurrence at the anastomotic site diagnosed exactly as mucinous adenocarcinoma 8480. Mucinous adenocarcinoma is a subtype/variant of the NOS adenocarcinoma, but they are two different histologies. Code two primaries, one for the original adenocarcinoma NOS and another for the subsequent anastomotic site mucinous adenocarcinoma. Note 1: There may or may not be physician documentation of anastomotic recurrence. Follow the rules.

ICD-O codes differ because of changes in histology coding rules. Note 3: The tumor may or may not invade into the colon wall or adjacent tissue. Note 4: A \u201crectal stump\u201d is an anastomotic site. Note 5: These rules are hierarchical. Only use this rule when previous rules do not apply. Rule M8 Abstract a single primaryi when a subsequent tumor arises at the anastomotic site AND: \u2022 The subsequent tumor occurs less than or equal to 36 months after original tumor resection OR Note: For cases diagnosed prior to 1/1/2022, timing is less than or equal to 24 months \u2022 The tumor arises in colon/rectal wall and/or surrounding tissue; there is no involvement of the mucosa (see illustration) OR \u2022 The pathologist or clinician documents an anastomotic recurrence Note 1: Bullet two does not apply to GIST. GISTs only start in the wall; never in the mucosa. Note 2: The physician may stage the subsequent tumor because the depth of invasion determines the second course of treatment. Note 3: These tumors are a single primary/recurrence. Registrars that collect recurrence information should record the information in the recurrence fields. Note 4: A \u201crectal stump\u201d is an anastomotic site. Rule M9 Abstract multiple primariesii when there are separate, non-contiguous tumors in sites with ICD-O site codes that differ at the fourth characters C18X. Note: Differences at the fourth character include different segments of the colon. Abstract a primary for each separate non-contiguous tumor in a different segment of the colon. This rule is not used for colon NOS C189. C189 is rarely used other than DCO. Example: The patient has adenocarcinoma in situ in a sigmoid polyp and mucinous adenocarcinoma in a polyp in the descending colon, the site code differs at the fourth character (sigmoid C187 and descending C186). Code two primaries, one for the sigmoid and another for the descending colon. Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 24 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Multiple Primary Rules C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Equivalent Terms and Definitions Jump to Histology Coding Rules Rule M10 Abstract multiple primariesii when the patient has a subsequent tumor after being clinically disease-free for greater than one year after the original diagnosis or last recurrence. Note 1: Clinically disease-free means that there was no evidence of recurrence on follow-up. \u2022 Colonoscopies are NED \u2022 Scans are NED Note 2: When there is a recurrence less than or equal to one year of diagnosis, the \u201cclock\u201d starts over. The time interval is calculated from the date of last recurrence. In other words, the patient must have been disease-free for greater than one year from the date of the last recurrence. Note 3: When the first course of treatment was a polypectomy only, this rule means there were no recurrences for greater than one year. Note 4: When the first course of treatment was a colectomy or A&P resection, there were no anastomotic recurrences for greater than one year. Note 5: When it is unknown/not documented whether the patient had a recurrence, default to date of diagnosis to compute the time interval. Note 6: The physician may state this is a recurrence, meaning the patient had a previous colon tumor and now has another colon tumor. Follow the rules; do not attempt to interpret the physician\u2019s statement. Rule M11 Abstract a single primaryi when synchronous, separate/non-contiguous tumors are on the same row in Table 1 in the Equivalent Terms and Definitions. Note: The same row means the tumors are: \u2022 The same histology (same four-digit ICD-O code) OR \u2022 One is the preferred term (column 1) and the other is a synonym for the preferred term (column 2) OR \u2022 A NOS (column 1/column 2) and the other is a subtype/variant of that NOS (column 3) Rule M12 Abstract a single primaryi (the invasive) when an in situ tumor is diagnosed after an invasive tumor. Note 1: The rules are hierarchical. Only use this rule when none of the previous rules apply. Note 2: The tumors may be a NOS and a subtype/variant of that NOS. See Table 1 in the Equivalent Terms and Definitions for listings of NOS and subtype/variants. Note 3: The in situ is recorded as a recurrence for those registrars who collect recurrence data. Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 25 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Multiple Primary Rules C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Equivalent Terms and Definitions Jump to Histology Coding Rules Rule M13 Abstract a single primaryi (the invasive) when an invasive tumor is diagnosed less than or equal to 60 days after an in situ tumor. Note 1: The rules are hierarchical. Only use this rule when previous rules do not apply. Note 2: Change behavior code on original abstract from /2 to /3. Do not change date of diagnosis. Note 3: If the case has already been submitted to the central registry, report all changes. Note 4: The physician may stage both tumors because staging and determining multiple primaries are done for different reasons. Staging determines which treatment would be most effective. Determining multiple primaries is done to stabilize the data for the study of epidemiology (long-term studies done on incidence, mortality, and causation of a disease with the goal of reducing or eliminating that disease). Note 5: See the COC and SEER manuals for instructions on coding data items such as Date of Diagnosis, Accession Year and Sequence Number. Rule M14 Abstract multiple primariesii when an invasive tumor occurs more than 60 days after an in situ tumor. Note 1: Abstract both the invasive and in situ tumors. Note 2: Abstract as multiple primaries even if physician states the invasive tumor is disease recurrence or progression. This rule is based on long-term epidemiologic studies of recurrence intervals. The specialty medical experts (SMEs) reviewed and approved these rules. Many of the SMEs were authors, co-authors, or editors of the AJCC Staging Manual. Rule M15 Abstract a single primaryi when tumors do not meet any of the above criteria. Note: Use caution when applying this default rule. Please confirm that you have not overlooked an applicable rule. Example: The pathology states adenocarcinoma in situ 8140/2 and a second non-contiguous invasive adenocarcinoma 8140/3 in the sigmoid colon C187. Multiple tumors that are the same histology in the same primary site (same four characters of ICD-O topography code) are a single primary. This is the end of instructions for Multiple Tumors. i Prepare one abstract. Use the histology rules to assign the appropriate histology code. For registries collecting recurrence data: When a subsequent tumor is \u201csingle primary,\u201d record that subsequent tumor as a recurrence. ii Prepare two or more abstracts. Use the histology rules to assign the appropriate histology code to each case abstracted.

Code the histology diagnosed prior to neoadjuvant treatment. Note 1: Histology changes may occur following immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy. Note 2: Neoadjuvant treatment is any tumor-related treatment given prior to surgical removal of the malignancy. Exception: If the initial diagnosis is based on histology from FNA, smears, cytology, or from a regional or metastatic site, and neoadjuvant treatment is given and followed by resection of primary site which identifies a different or specific histology, code the histology from the primary site. 2. Code the histology using the following priority list and the Histology Rules. Do not change histology in order to make the case applicable to staging. The priority list is used for single primaries (including multiple tumors abstracted as a single primary). This is a hierarchical list of source documentation. Code the most specific pathology/tissue from either resection or biopsy. Note 1: The term \u201cmost specific\u201d usually refers to a subtype/variant. Note 2: The histology rules instruct to code the invasive histology when there are in situ and invasive components in a single tumor. Note 3: When there is a discrepancy between the biopsy and resection (two distinctly different histologies/different rows), code the histology from the most representative specimen (the greater amount of tumor). 1. Tissue or pathology report from primary site (in priority order) A. Addendum(s) and/or comment(s) B. Final diagnosis / synoptic report as required by CAP C. CAP protocol Note 1: Addendums and comments on the pathology report are given a high priority because they often contain information about molecular testing, genetic testing, and/or special stains which give a more specific diagnosis. Note 2: The pathologist\u2019s diagnosis from the pathology report is always reliable, so the final diagnosis is the second priority. Note 3: The CAP protocol is a checklist which: Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 27 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Histology Rules C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Equivalent Terms and Definitions Jump to Multiple Primary Rules \u2022 Provides guidelines for collecting the essential data elements for complete reporting of malignant tumors and optimal patient care \u2022 Allows physicians to check multiple histologies 2. Tissue/pathology from a metastatic site Note 1: Code the behavior /3. Note 2: The tissue from a metastatic site often shows variations from the primary tumor. When it is the only tissue available, it is more accurate than a scan. 3. Scan: The following list is in priority order. A. CT B. PET C. MRI 4. Code the histology documented by the physician when none of the above are available. Use the documentation in the following priority order: A. Treatment plan B. Documentation from Tumor Board C. Documentation in the medical record that refers to original pathology, cytology, or scan(s) D. Physician\u2019s reference to type of cancer (histology) in the medical record Note 1: Code the specific histology when documented. Note 2: Code the histology to 8000 (cancer/malignant neoplasm, NOS) or as stated by the physician when nothing more specific is documented. 5.

DO NOT USE BREAST HISTOLOGY CODING RULES FOR THIS SITE. Note 2: Only use this section for one or more histologies within a single tumor. Note 3: Do not use this section in place of the Histology Rules. 1. Code the most specific histology or subtype/type/variant, regardless of whether it is described as: A. The majority or predominant part of tumor B. The minority of tumor C. A component Note 1: Mucinous and signet ring cell carcinoma must meet a percentage requirement in order to be coded. Refer to the Histology Rules if mucinous and/or signet ring cell carcinoma is present. Note 2: The terms above (A, B, C) must describe a carcinoma or sarcoma in order to code a histology described by those terms. Example: When the diagnosis is adenocarcinoma with a component of medullary carcinoma, code medullary carcinoma 8510. Negative Example: When the diagnosis is simply adenocarcinoma with a medullary component, code adenocarcinoma NOS 8140. Do not assume this is a medullary carcinoma. This could be medullary differentiation or features. Note 3: When the most specific histology is described as differentiation or features, see #2. Example 1: Diagnosis for a single tumor is adenocarcinoma 8140 with the majority or predominant part of tumor being medullary adenocarcinoma 8510. Code the subtype/variant: medullary adenocarcinoma 8510. Example 2: Diagnosis for a single tumor is mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma 8244 with minority of tumor being goblet cell carcinoid 8243. Code the subtype/variant: goblet cell carcinoid 8243. Example 3: Diagnosis for a single tumor is sarcoma NOS 8800/3 with a component of leiomyosarcoma 8890/3. Code the subtype/variant: leiomyosarcoma 8890/3. 2. Code the histology described as differentiation or features/features of ONLY when there is a specific ICD-O code for the \u201cNOS with ____ features\u201d or \u201cNOS with ____ differentiation\u201d. Note: Do not code differentiation or features when there is no specific ICD-O code. 3. Code the specific histology described by ambiguous terminology (list follows) ONLY when A or B is true: A.

The case is accessioned (entered into the database) as required by both SEER and COC. No further information is available. Code the histology malignant GIST. The case meets the criteria in #3A. B. There is a NOS histology and a more specific (subtype/variant) described by ambiguous terminology \u2022 Specific histology is clinically confirmed by a physician (attending, pathologist, oncologist, etc.) OR \u2022 Patient is receiving treatment based on the specific histology described by ambiguous term Example 1: The pathology diagnosis is adenocarcinoma consistent with micropapillary carcinoma. The oncology consult says the patient has micropapillary carcinoma of the cecum. This is clinical confirmation of the diagnosis, code micropapillary carcinoma. The case meets the criteria in bullet 1. Example 2: The pathology diagnosis is mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma consistent with goblet cell carcinoid. The treatment plan says the patient will receive the following treatment for goblet cell carcinoid. Treatment plan confirms goblet cell carcinoid; code goblet cell carcinoid. The case meets the criteria in bullet 2. If the specific histology does not meet the criteria in #3B, then code the NOS histology.

For mucinous adenocarcinoma mixed with another histology OR signet ring cell carcinoma mixed with another histology, proceed through the rules. Rule H5 Code low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) and high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (HAMN) 8480/2 when: \u2022 Diagnosis date is 1/1/2022 forward AND \u2022 Behavior is stated to be in situ/non-invasive OR \u2022 Behavior is not indicated Note 1: ICD-O-3.2 lists LAMN with behavior of /1. WHO 5th Ed Digestive Systems Tumors indicates this neoplasm is considered in situ. After consulting with WHO Digestive System editors, College of American pathologists, and AJCC GI chapter experts, the standard setting organizations have agreed LAMN should be collected and should be assigned a behavior code of /2 beginning with cases diagnosed 1/1/2022 forward. Note 2: A diagnosis of LAMN or HAMN does not require the tumor be comprised of greater than 50% mucinous in order to be coded 8480. Note 3: If the pathologist indicates LAMN or HAMN is invasive or has a malignant behavior, continue through the rules. Rule H6 Code invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma 8480 when the diagnosis is any of the following: \u2022 Exactly \u201cmucinous adenocarcinoma\u201d (no modifiers) \u2022 High grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (HAMN) stated to be invasive (DX 1/1/2022 forward) \u2022 High-grade pseudomyxoma peritonei \u2022 Invasive pseudomyxoma peritonei \u2022 Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) stated to be invasive (DX 1/1/2022 forward) \u2022 Malignant pseudomyxoma peritonei Colon Solid Tumor Rules September 2021 Update 33 Colon, Rectosigmoid, and Rectum Histology Rules C180-C189, C199, C209 (Excludes lymphoma and leukemia M9590 \u2013 M9992 and Kaposi sarcoma M9140) Jump to Equivalent Terms and Definitions Jump to Multiple Primary Rules \u2022 Two histologies and mucinous is documented to be greater than 50% of the tumor \u03bf Mucinous carcinoma must meet a percentage requirement in order to be coded. Do not use majority of tumor, predominantly, or predominant part of the tumor to code mucinous 8480. Note 1: Be very careful when determining primary site; almost all pseudomyxoma peritonei originate in the appendix C181. However, it can be metastatic disease from sites such as bowel, ovary, or bladder. Code the primary site as designated by a physician. When the primary site is not designated, code unknown primary C809 and the histology as mucinous carcinoma 8480. Note 2: Report the appendiceal mucinous neoplasm as malignant /3 using the ICD-O matrix principle and the SEER and COC Manuals when the pathology from the appendix is low-grade mucinous neoplasm (not reportable prior to 1/1/2022) AND \u2022 The pseudomyxoma peritonei are high-grade/invasive/malignant OR \u2022 Patient is treated for malignant pseudomyxoma peritonei OR \u2022 The diagnosis is low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) and the physician states it is malignant OR \u2022 The diagnosis is high grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (HAMN) and the physician states it is malignant Note 3: The following are non-reportable for cases diagnosed prior to 1/1/2022: \u2022 Appendiceal neoplasm with low-grade pseudomyxoma peritonei AND no treatment \u2022 No designation of high- or low-grade for the appendiceal neoplasm AND no treatment for the pseudomyxoma peritonei Rule H7 Code invasive signet ring cell adenocarcinoma 8490 when the diagnosis is any of the following: \u2022 Exactly signet ring cell carcinoma (no modifiers) \u2022 Adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma, where signet ring cell is documented to be greater than 50% of the tumor \u03bf Signet ring cell adenocarcinoma must meet a percentage requirement in order to be coded. Do not use majority of tumor, predominantly, or predominant part of tumor to code signet ring cell 8490.

Note 1: Code 8140 adenocarcinoma NOS even if pathology says intestinal type adenocarcinoma. Note 2: Do not use code 8144 adenocarcinoma intestinal type for colorectal primaries. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma 8144 is used for tumors which occur in the stomach, head and neck, and specific GYN sites. It is called intestinal because it resembles carcinoma which occurs in the colon, rectosigmoid or rectum. Note 3: When a diagnosis of intestinal type adenocarcinoma is further described by a specific term (such as mucinous intestinal type adenocarcinoma or signet ring cell intestinal type adenocarcinoma), it would be treated as an adenocarcinoma with a subtype/variant. Rule H9 Code the histology when only one histology is present. Note 1: Use Table 1 to code histology. New codes, terms, and synonyms are included in Table 1 and coding errors may occur if the table is not used. Note 2: Use the ICD-O and all updates when the histology is not listed in Table 1. Note 3: Submit a question to Ask a SEER Registrar when the histology code is not found in Table 1, ICD-O or all updates.

Often the cancer directly invades the portal vein, the adjacent liver, along the common bile duct, and the adjacent lymph nodes. Portal hypertension may result from invasion of the portal vein. Spread to distant parts of the body is uncommon, but intra-abdominal metastases, particularly peritoneal metastases, do occur. Transperitoneal and hematogenous hepatic metastases also [...] ## Treatment of Resectable (Localized) Bile Duct Cancer\n\n### Treatment Options for Resectable (Localized) Bile Duct Cancer\n\nTreatment options for resectable (localized) bile duct cancer include:\n\n1.

Interventions were most frequently designed for older patients or patients with heart failure and were often associated with inconsistent outcomes in LOS, readmissions, and mortality across populations.\n\n**Meaning**This systematic review found that across all high-risk populations, there are inconsistent results on the effectiveness associated with interventions to reduce LOS, such as discharge planning, which are often widely used by health systems.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Abstract \n\n**Importance**Many strategies to reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) have been implemented, but few studies have evaluated hospital-led interventions focused on high-risk populations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Learning Health System panel commissioned this study to further evaluate system-level interventions for LOS reduction.\n\n**Objective**To identify and synthesize evidence regarding potential systems-level strategies to reduce LOS for patients at high risk for prolonged LOS.\n\n**Evidence Review**Multiple databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for English-language systematic reviews from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2020, with updated searches through January 19, 2021. The scope of the protocol was determined with input from AHRQ Key Informants. Systematic reviews were included if they reported on hospital-led interventions intended to decrease LOS for high-risk populations, defined as those with high-risk medical conditions or socioeconomically vulnerable populations (eg, patients with high levels of socioeconomic risk, who are medically uninsured or underinsured, with limited English proficiency, or who are hospitalized at a safety-net, tertiary, or quaternary care institution). Exclusion criteria included interventions that were conducted outside of the hospital setting, including community health programs. Data extraction was conducted independently, with extraction of strength of evidence (SOE) ratings provided by systematic reviews; if unavailable, SOE was assessed using the AHRQ Evidence-Based Practice Center methods guide.\n\n**Findings**Our searches yielded 4432 potential studies. We included 19 systematic reviews reported in 20 articles. The reviews described 8 strategies for reducing LOS in high-risk populations: discharge planning, geriatric assessment, medication management, clinical pathways, interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary care, case management, hospitalist services, and telehealth. Interventions were most frequently designed for older patients, often those who were frail (9 studies), or patients with heart failure. There were notable evidence gaps, as there were no systematic reviews studying interventions for patients with socioeconomic risk. For patients with medically complex conditions, discharge planning, medication management, and interdisciplinary care teams were associated with inconsistent outcomes (LOS, readmissions, mortality) across populations. For patients with heart failure, clinical pathways and case management were associated with reduced length of stay (clinical pathways: mean difference reduction, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.44] days; case management: mean difference reduction, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.04] days).\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance**This systematic review found inconsistent results across all high-risk populations on the effectiveness associated with interventions, such as discharge planning, that are often widely used by health systems. This systematic review highlights important evidence gaps, such as the lack of existing systematic reviews focused on patients with socioeconomic risk factors, and the need for further research.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Introduction \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nHospital length of stay (LOS) is a quality metric health systems use as a proxy of efficient hospital management. Reduction in LOS improves bed turnover, allowing hospitals to match demand with capacity for elective and emergent admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and interhospital transfers.[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r1),[2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r2) When demand exceeds capacity, emergency department crowding, ICU strain, and ward strain occur, all of which are associated with worse outcomes, including mortality.[3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r3)-[9](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r3) Classifying patient hospital stays into diagnosis-related groups with fixed reimbursements further incentivizes hospitals to improve LOS to maintain operating margins.[10](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r10) However, important potential trade-offs between LOS reduction and postdischarge adverse outcomes (eg, readmissions, mortality) exist. Furthermore, prolonged LOS may be associated with negative patient and staff experience, as well as increased inpatient complications (eg, hospital acquired infections, falls), many of which may be preventable.[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r11) Therefore, many hospitals aim to implement systems-level approaches to provide optimal care and a safe discharge while avoiding prolonged hospital stays.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nMany strategies to reduce hospital LOS have been developed, including some targeting different aspects of patient management, such as clinical care (eg, enhanced recovery programs and early mobility programs[12](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r12)-[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r12)), and others focusing on staffing models[16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r16),[17](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r17) and logistics of care coordination.[18](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r18)-[22](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r18) Although evidence is limited, some interventions, such as enhanced recovery after surgery programs, have focused on elective admissions and have been reported as consistently associated with improved LOS for planned, scheduled surgeries.[23](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r23) In contrast to elective admissions, much less is known about the effectiveness of interventions in unplanned hospitalizations, especially among populations at-risk for poor outcomes. This includes patients who are medically complex, such as older adults, patients with heart failure, or patients with other chronic comorbidities who are at increased risk for prolonged LOS. Similarly, such interventions may be less generalizable to patients with socioeconomic risk factors more likely to be affected by health care disparities and at increased risk for adverse events related to hospitalization[24](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r24) and unnecessary delays in discharge.[25](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r25)-[27](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r25) Furthermore, many hospitals within Learning Health Systems, including safety-net hospitals, serve populations at disproportionately high risk for prolonged LOS and often struggle to maintain operating margins as a result. Long-term financial viability of these hospitals is crucial to ensuring access to care for underserved populations.[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r5) Therefore, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Learning Health System Panel identified a need to identify broad system-level interventions to reduce LOS among patients with high risk of prolonged LOS.[28](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r28) To address this need, we performed an overview of systematic reviews to identify interventions intended to reduce LOS for high-risk populations and identify evidence gaps. In this systematic review, we summarize existing evidence, with a specific focus on hospitalized older adults and patients with heart failure.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Methods \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nThis systematic review is based on a technical brief performed by the ECRI-Penn Medicine Evidence-based Practice Center for the AHRQ. The protocol and final report are available elsewhere.[29](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r29) We interviewed 7 key informants with expertise in health systems, health care delivery processes, high-risk populations, care model transformation, and hospital quality and safety and incorporated input to refine scope and aims. This report follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses ([PRISMA](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/)) reporting guideline for systematic reviews.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Data Sources and Search Strategy \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nMedical librarians searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature sources, including from government agencies and relevant stakeholder organizations, from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2020, with updated searches through January 19, 2021. Search terms are provided in eTable 1 in the [Supplement](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#note-ZOI210761-1). The full search strategy is available in the full report, published elsewhere.[29](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r29)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Study Selection \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nAbstracts and full-text articles were screened in duplicate by a methodologist and a clinician using DistillerSR (Evidence Partners) using predetermined criteria ([Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761t1)). Based on input from key informants, we focused on 2 populations at high-risk for prolonged LOS: patients with socioeconomic risk factors (eg, underinsured or uninsured) and patients who are medically complex (eg, with frailty or multimorbidity) ([Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761t1)). Systematic reviews were included if they examined acute unplanned hospitalizations in the United States, evaluated hospital-initiated interventions (such as case management or multidisciplinary team models), aimed to reduce hospital LOS, reported on LOS as a primary outcome, and were published in English. We also required systematic reviews to provide explicit search criteria and inclusion and exclusion criteria and assess risk of bias (ROB) for included studies. We excluded systematic reviews focused on admission for nonemergent elective procedures, utilizing interventions not initiated within hospital settings (eg, community-based programs or ambulatory care visits after discharge), or including more than 50% of studies from outside of the United States.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\nTable 1.

Assessment \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nA standardized data extraction form was used to collect patient population, hospital and intervention characteristics, comparators, and outcomes assessed. Included systematic reviews were required to meet several thresholds for quality, including explicit search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ROB assessment; therefore, independent quality assessment of included reviews was not performed. LOS was extracted as the primary outcome, with associated balancing measures as secondary outcomes, including readmission and mortality rates. For each outcome, when available, we extracted strength of evidence (SOE) ratings provided by systematic reviews. If not provided, we assessed SOE using AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Center guidance.[30](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r30)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Data Synthesis \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nWe narratively summarized evidence for heart failure and older populations and developed an evidence map to summarize the direction of association, volume, and quality of existing data for interventions across key outcomes (ie, LOS, readmission, and mortality). We also highlighted important knowledge gaps in the evidence base.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Results \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nOf 4432 potentially relevant studies, we included 19 systematic reviews in 20 publications, 1 of which was identified in our gray literature search.[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r20),[31](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r31)-[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r31) The most common reason for exclusion was that the systematic review did not describe a hospital-led intervention.

No systematic reviews focused on patients with socioeconomic risk factors (eg, housing instability, social isolation, no medical insurance or underinsuance, social mobility, lack of social network, lack of social support, limited access to health care services or social services, rural settings), limited English proficiency, or hospitalization at a safety-net or tertiary or quaternary care hospital. Furthermore, although systematic reviews did address certain populations of patients who were medically complex (including patients with chronic diseases, infants with high risk, and pregnant women with high risk), no systematic reviews assessed interventions for other key medically complex populations, such as patients with substance use disorder, comorbid psychiatric or behavioral health problems, or common chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Older Patients \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nThere were 9 systematic reviews (in 10 publications) that included older patients,[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r33),[37](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r37)-[39](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r37),[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43),[44](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r44),[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r46)-[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r46) with 4 systematic reviews focused on elderly patients who were frail. Of these, 5 systematic reviews performed quantitative synthesis of LOS and assessed discharge planning interventions (3 systematic reviews) and geriatric assessment or consultation (2 systematic reviews).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nDischarge planning interventions (eg, early assessment of discharge suitability, establishing discharge plan and follow-up) had mixed results among older patients ([Table 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761t2)). One systematic review by Mabire et al[37](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r37),[38](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r38) included 4 RCTs, 1 pre-post study, and 1 cohort study (including 2370 patients) assessing nursing-led discharge planning interventions, and found the intervention was associated with increased hospital LOS (weighted mean difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.35] days; low SOE). Although LOS increased, discharge planning was associated with improved readmission rates (odds ratio [OR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.81]; _P_ = .01), although a subanalysis specific to transitional care did not find an association with improvement (OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.38 to 1.27]). Another review by Goncalves-Bradley et al[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r46) examined transitional care programs run by clinical nurse specialists across 12 RCTs (including 2193 patients) and found a decrease in LOS (mean difference, \u22120.73 [95% CI, \u22121.33 to \u22120.12] days; moderate SOE). A subgroup analysis focused on older surgical patients, including 2 RCTs (including 184 patients), found no change in LOS (mean difference, \u22120.06 [95% CI, \u22121.23 to 1.11] days). The third review by Bryant-Lukosius et al[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43) also evaluated a nurse-led intervention in 3 RCTs (including 396 patients) and found no difference in LOS (mean difference, \u22120.69 [95% CI, \u22121.95 to 0.56] days; low SOE).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nThere were 2 systematic reviews that quantitatively assessed outcomes associated with geriatric assessment or consultation interventions and also found mixed LOS outcomes. Eagles et al[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r49) evaluated geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician for reducing LOS for patients aged 65 years or older admitted to a trauma center. Based on 2 retrospective cohort studies (including 5414 patients), Eagles et al[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r49) found that compared with standard care, geriatric assessment was associated with reduced LOS (mean difference, \u22121.11 [95% CI, \u22121.43 to \u22120.79] days; moderate SOE).[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r49) Pre-post studies (including 7408 patients) from the systematic review by Eagles et al[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r49) did not show improvement in mortality (unadjusted OR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.18]), but cohort data comparing geriatric trauma consultation with standard of care (including 482 patients) did show improvement associated with consultation in inpatient mortality (unadjusted OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.52]; _I_ 2 = 0%; moderate SOE). In contrast, another review by Van Craen et al[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r47) included 7 RCTs (including 4759 patients) and found no difference in LOS (mean reduction, 0.07 [95% CI, \u22120.11 to 0.26] days) or mortality at 12 months (relative risk [RR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.08]; high SOE). Notably, the review by Van Craen et al[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r47) focused on elderly patients who were frail, which may have represented a higher-risk population than other studies. Van Craen et al[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r47) noted that the components and implementation of the intervention (geriatric evaluation and treatment unit) across included studies was heterogeneous.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Heart Failure \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nWe found 4 systematic reviews assessing 3 interventions (ie, discharge planning, clinical pathways, and case management) in patients with heart failure. However, only 2 of 4 systematic reviews meta-analyzed outcomes for LOS. One systematic review did not provide quantitative synthesis for LOS but found no difference in readmission (defined as unplanned readmission at 90 days) or mortality, although the intervention was associated with improved patient satisfaction.[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nOne systematic review performed a quantitative assessment of LOS for clinical pathway interventions. Kul et al[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r36) included 1 RCT and 4 observational studies (including 2095 patients) and found that clinical pathway utilization was associated with reduced LOS (mean difference reduction, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.44] days; _I_ 2 = 42%; low SOE). There was also a reduction in readmission rate (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99]; _I_ 2 = 16%; moderate SOE) and inpatient mortality (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.94]; _I_ 2 = 73%; low SOE).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nA single systematic review by Huntley et al[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r35) examined case management interventions. Huntley et al[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r35) included 8 RCTs and 1 observational study (including 1765 patients) and found an association with decreased LOS (mean difference reduction, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.52 to 2.04] days; _I_ 2 = 63%; moderate SOE). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high ROB found a mean reduction of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.23-2.29) days (_I_ 2 = 14%). Regarding readmission, Huntley et al[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r35) found that case management interventions studied in 12 RCTs and 1 observational study (including 3346 patients) were associated with reduced readmission rates (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92]; moderate SOE) with increased heterogeneity (_I_ 2 = 69%), with similar results when high ROB studies were excluded (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.96]; _I_ 2 = 68%).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nA review by Bryant-Lukosius et al[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43) evaluated discharge planning interventions across multiple patient populations aged in their early to mid-70s, including patients with heart failure (2 RCTs with 495 patients). Although the systematic review did not perform quantitative synthesis of LOS for patients with heart failure, Bryant-Lukosius et al[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43) found no difference in readmission rates, defined as unplanned readmission at 90 days (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.13]), and no difference in mortality (including 345 patients; RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.42]). However, the intervention was associated with improved patient satisfaction (including 403 patients; mean difference, 6.09 [95% CI, 3.55 to 8.63]; _P_< .001; moderate SOE).\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Discussion \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nThis systematic review identified evidence for 8 hospital-based interventions targeting high-risk patient populations: discharge planning,[20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r20),[37](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r37),[38](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r38),[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43),[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r46) geriatric assessment or consultation,[33](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r33),[39](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r39),[44](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r44),[47](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r47),[49](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r49) medication management,[31](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r31),[34](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r34),[45](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r45) clinical pathways,[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r36),[42](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r42) interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary care,[40](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r40),[48](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r48) case management,[35](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r35) hospitalist services,[41](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r41) and telehealth.[32](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r32) As shown [Table 3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761t3), aside from interventions for patients with heart failure, interventions were not consistently associated with reduced hospital LOS for medically complex populations. It is important to note that patients who are medically complex do not exist in silos, as older patients may also have chronic conditions, such as heart failure; therefore, identifying interventions that could reduce LOS across populations is important.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nFor patients with heart failure, clinical pathways and case management interventions were both associated with reduced LOS, readmission rates, and mortality.[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r36) These findings are notable, since prior research has shown that interventions may improve LOS but worsen readmission rates or mortality.[50](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r50) However, it is important to recognize the significant heterogeneity across studies in the systematic review by Kul et al[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r36); similarly, another included narrative review on clinical pathways did not perform meta-analysis owing to increased heterogeneity.[42](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r42) This suggests local context and resources (eg, team dynamics, hospital priorities, processes and staffing resources, and administrative support) are likely important factors in how successful interventions, such as clinical pathways or case management, are in streamlining care.[36](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r36),[51](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r51),[52](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r52)\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nHospitalized older patients often have increased costs, complications, worse outcomes,[53](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r53),[54](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r54) and longer LOS compared with younger patients. For example, a study by Freeman et al[53](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r53) estimated that compared with younger patients (aged 18-44 years), older adults (aged 65-84 years) had hospital stays that were a mean of 1.4 days longer. However, no intervention was consistently associated with reduced LOS for older patients. While 1 review found discharge planning was associated with a 0.73-day reduction in LOS in older patients,[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r46) others found no association with reduced LOS, or even found an association with increased LOS.[37](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r37),[38](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r38),[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r43) Inpatient geriatric assessment interventions also yielded inconsistent results. The largest review on this topic was unable to meta-analyze results owing to heterogeneity in study designs and settings across 11 RCTs.[44](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r44) Studies\u2019 settings included academic medical centers as well as community hospitals, and intervention components varied across studies. Thus, the variable associations with LOS across studies may reflect organizational differences, as LOS may vary depending on hospital factors, such as patient transfers, bed capacity, and demand. Future studies are needed to identify if interventions would provide more consistent benefits for particular types of hospitals or wards.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Limitations \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nThis systematic review has several important limitations. First, we used systematic reviews instead of primary studies to characterize interventions. Using systematic reviews facilitated searching for evidence across a broad range of populations and interventions and supported identification of evidence gaps. However, systematic reviews rarely reported key aspects of local environments (eg, demographic data on patient volume, bed size, payer mix, or other organizational capacity), which individual studies may have reported and would provide valuable context for health systems gauging feasibility and likelihood of success. Future systematic reviews assessing hospital LOS should certainly highlight these factors. Second, as systematic reviews inherently lag behind primary research, our evidence base may have missed interventions not yet captured in a published review. However, a targeted search of RCTs through January 19, 2021, identified no additional relevant studies pertinent to older or heart failure populations. Third, we did not formally assess systematic review quality; however, because systematic reviews were required to meet certain methodological standards for inclusion (ie, explicit search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ROB assessment), all included systematic reviews met this threshold for quality.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n Conclusions \n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\nIn this systematic review, we found 19 systematic reviews that identified 8 strategies for reducing LOS in high-risk populations: discharge planning, geriatric assessment; medication management; clinical pathways; inter- or multidisciplinary care; case management; hospitalist services; and telehealth. Identifying hospital-initiated interventions to reduce LOS without increasing readmissions or mortality is of interest to most hospitals and health systems. While many hospitals are searching for a one-size-fits-all solution to streamline care, our systematic review found that no single intervention was consistently associated with reduced LOS across all high-risk populations. A 2011 study by Hansen et al[55](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r55) found that no single intervention was associated with reduced readmissions across broad populations. Since then, national initiatives have resulted in development of multifaceted approaches that include a range or combination of interventions that can be adapted for local context.[56](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#zoi210761r56) Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce LOS, particularly for high-risk populations, could benefit from a similar approach. Future research assessing interventions for LOS reduction in high-risk populations or subpopulations should also consider implementation science measures to inform local adaption.\n\n[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338)\n\n[Back to top](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338#top)\n\n Article Information \n\n**Accepted for Publication:** July 18, 2021.\n\n**Published:** September 20, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25846\n\n**Open Access:** This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the [CC-BY License](https://jamanetwork.com/pages/cc-by-license-permissions). \u00a9 2021 Siddique SM et al. _JAMA Network Open_.\n\n**Corresponding Author:** Shazia Mehmood Siddique, MD, MSHP, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd, 7th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104 ([shazia.siddique@pennmedicine.upenn.edu](mailto:shazia.siddique@pennmedicine.upenn.edu)).\n\n**Author Contributions:** Dr Siddique and Ms Tipton had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

The true incidence of bile duct cancer is unknown because establishing an accurate diagnosis is difficult.\n\nTraditionally, bile duct tumors located within the liver were classified with hepatocellular carcinoma as primary liver tumors.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] In contrast, bile duct tumors located outside of the liver were classified with gallbladder cancer as extrahepatic biliary tract tumors.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] The classification of bile duct tumors has changed to include intrahepatic tumors of the bile ducts and extrahepatic tumors (perihilar and distal) of the bile ducts.\n\nApproximately 50% of cholangiocarcinomas arise in the bile ducts of the perihilar region, 40% in the distal region, and 10% in the intrahepatic region.\n\nMany bile duct cancers are multifocal. In most patients, the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery and is incurable. Palliative measures such as resection, radiation therapy (e.g., brachytherapy or external-beam radiation therapy), or stenting procedures may maintain adequate biliary drainage and allow for improved quality of life.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nThe biliary system consists of a network of ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small bowel and is classified by its anatomical location (Figure [1](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_253)). Bile is produced by the liver and is important for fat digestion.\n\n#### Intrahepatic bile duct\n\nThe bile ducts located within the liver are called intrahepatic bile ducts. Tumors of the intrahepatic bile ducts originate in small intrahepatic ductules or large intrahepatic ducts that are proximal to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts. These tumors are also known as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.\n\n#### Extrahepatic bile duct\n\nThe bile ducts located outside of the liver are called extrahepatic bile ducts. They include part of the right and left hepatic ducts that are outside of the liver, the common hepatic duct, and the common bile duct. The extrahepatic bile ducts can be further divided into the perihilar (hilum) region and distal region.\n\n* **Perihilar (hilum) region.** The hilum is the region where the right and left hepatic ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct that is proximal to the origin of the cystic duct. Tumors of this region are also known as perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or Klatskin tumors.\n* **Distal region.** This region includes the common bile duct and inserts into the small intestine. Tumors of this region are also known as extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (Figure [2](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_254)).\n\n### Risk Factors\n\nBile duct cancer may occur more frequently in patients with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic ulcerative colitis, choledochal cysts, or infections with the liver fluke *Clonorchis sinensis*.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]\n\n### Clinical Features\n\nDistal and perihilar bile duct cancers frequently cause biliary tract obstruction, leading to the following symptoms:\n\n* Jaundice.\n* Weight loss.\n* Abdominal pain.\n* Fever.\n* Pruritus.\n\nIntrahepatic bile duct cancer may be relatively indolent and difficult to differentiate clinically from metastatic adenocarcinoma deposits in the liver.\n\n### Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation\n\nClinical evaluation is dependent on laboratory and radiographic imaging tests that include:\n\n* Liver function tests and other laboratory studies.\n* Abdominal ultrasonography.\n* Computed tomography.\n* Magnetic resonance imaging.\n* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.\n\nThese tests demonstrate the extent of the primary tumor and help determine the presence or absence of distant metastases.\n\nIf a patient is medically fit for surgery and the tumor is amenable to surgical resection, surgical exploration is performed. Pathological examination of the resected specimen is done to establish definitive pathological staging.\n\n### Prognosis\n\nPrognosis depends in part on the tumor\u2019s anatomical location, which affects resectability. Because of proximity to major blood vessels and diffuse extension within the liver, a bile duct tumor can be difficult to resect. Total resection is possible in 25% to 30% of lesions that originate in the distal bile duct; the resectability rate is lower for lesions that occur in more proximal sites.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]\n\nComplete resection with negative surgical margins offers the only chance of cure for bile duct cancer. For localized, resectable extrahepatic and intrahepatic tumors, the presence of involved lymph nodes and perineural invasion are significant adverse prognostic factors.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)-[6](#cit/section_1.6)]\n\nAdditionally, among patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, the following prognostic factors have been associated with worse outcomes:[[7](#cit/section_1.7)-[9](#cit/section_1.9)]\n\n* A personal history of primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n* Elevated cancer antigen 19-9 level.\n* Periductal infiltrating tumor growth pattern.\n* Presence of hepatic venous invasion.\n\n###### References\n\n1.

The TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is used for staging bile duct cancer, commonly after surgery and pathological examination of the resected specimen. Evaluation of the extent of disease at laparotomy is an important component of staging.\n\n### AJCC Staging System for Bile Duct Cancer\n\n#### AJCC staging system for intrahepatic bile duct cancer\n\nThe AJCC has designated staging by TNM classification to define intrahepatic bile duct cancer.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]\n\nTables [1](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_353), [2](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_381), [3](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_356), [4](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_379), and [5](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_359) pertain to the intrahepatic bile duct cancer stages.\n\nTable 1.

These tumors represent a very small number of cases and are usually in the distal common bile duct. Among patients treated with surgical resection, long-term prognosis varies depending on primary tumor extent, margin status, lymph node involvement, and additional pathological features.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)]\n\nExtended resections of hepatic duct bifurcation tumors (Klatskin tumors, also known as hilar tumors) to include adjacent liver, either by lobectomy or removal of portions of segments 4 and 5 of the liver, may be performed. If major hepatic resection is necessary to achieve a complete resection, postoperative hepatic reserve should be evaluated. For patients with underlying cirrhosis, the Child-Pugh class and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score are determined.\n\n### Unresectable (Including Metastatic and Recurrent) Bile Duct Cancer\n\nMost cases of intrahepatic, distal, and perihilar bile duct cancer are unresectable and cannot be completely removed. Often the cancer directly invades the portal vein, the adjacent liver, along the common bile duct, and the adjacent lymph nodes. Portal hypertension may result from invasion of the portal vein. Spread to distant parts of the body is uncommon, but intra-abdominal metastases, particularly peritoneal metastases, do occur. Transperitoneal and hematogenous hepatic metastases also occur with bile duct cancer of all sites. Moreover, most patients who undergo resection will develop recurrent disease within the hepatobiliary system or, less frequently, at distant sites.\n\nIn locally advanced disease, phase II trials have evaluated chemoradiotherapy with the goal of improved local control and potential downstaging for surgical resection.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[4](#cit/section_4.4)] These approaches have not been compared with standard therapy, and the curative potential is unknown.\n\nFor patients with unresectable bile duct cancer, management is directed at palliation.\n\nTreatment options for bile duct cancer are described in [Table 16](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_499).\n\nTable 16. Treatment Options for Bile Duct Cancer\n\n| Staging Criteria | Treatment Options |\n| Resectable (Localized) Bile Duct Cancer | [Surgery](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_440) |\n| [Adjuvant therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_476) |\n| Unresectable (Including Metastatic and Recurrent) Bile Duct Cancer | [Palliative therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_542) |\n| [Chemotherapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_546) |\n| [Immunotherapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_558) |\n| [Targeted therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_564) |\n\n### Capecitabine and Fluorouracil Dosing\n\nThe *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[6](#cit/section_4.6)] Patients with the *DPYD\\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)-[7](#cit/section_4.7)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)-[10](#cit/section_4.10)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)]\n\n###### References\n\n1.

[Surgery](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_440).\n2. [Adjuvant therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_476).\n\n#### Surgery\n\n##### Intrahepatic bile duct cancer\n\nFor intrahepatic bile duct cancers, hepatic resection to achieve negative margins is potentially curative. If a major liver resection is necessary to achieve negative surgical margins, preoperative portal vein embolization may be considered to optimize the volume of the remnant liver.\n\nPartial liver resection or partial hepatectomy to achieve negative margins is a procedure with curative intent for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] The extent of liver resection necessary depends on the extent of hepatic parenchymal involvement and the proximity of the tumor to major blood vessels in this region.\n\nThe role of routine portal lymphadenectomy has not been well established because of the risk of common bile duct devascularization.\n\n##### Perihilar bile duct cancer\n\nFor perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (Klatskin tumors), bile duct resection alone leads to high local recurrence rates resulting from the early confluence of the hepatic ducts and the caudate lobe. The addition of partial hepatectomy that includes the caudate lobe has improved long-term outcomes, but it may be associated with increased postoperative complications.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] With this aggressive surgical approach, 5-year survival rates of 20% to 50% have been reported.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] An understanding of both the normal and varied vascular and ductal anatomy of the porta hepatis has increased the number of hepatic duct bifurcation tumors that can be resected.\n\nThe primary site of relapse after surgical resection is local, but distant recurrence is also frequently reported.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]\n\nThe optimal surgical procedure for carcinoma of the perihilar bile duct varies according to the location of the tumor along the biliary tree, the extent of hepatic parenchymal involvement, and the proximity of the tumor to major blood vessels in this region. The state of the regional lymph nodes is assessed at the time of surgery because of their prognostic significance. Operations for bile duct cancer are usually extensive. A historical cohort reported an operative mortality rate of approximately 10%, along with a roughly 40% risk of disease recurrence.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)]\n\nIn jaundiced patients, the role of percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage or endoscopic placement of a stent for relief of biliary obstruction is controversial because of inconsistent findings of significant clinical benefit and concerns of increased risk of postoperative complications.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] However, percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage or endoscopic placement of a stent for relief of biliary obstruction may be considered before surgery, particularly if jaundice is severe or an element of azotemia is present.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[8](#cit/section_5.8)]\n\n##### Distal bile duct cancer\n\nComplete surgical resection with negative surgical margins offers the only chance of cure for distal bile duct cancers. Bile duct tumors can be difficult to resect because of their proximity to major blood vessels and diffuse infiltration of adjacent bile ducts. Total resection is possible in 25% to 30% of lesions that originate in the distal bile duct. The resectability rate is lower for lesions that occur in more proximal sites.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]\n\nThe optimum surgical procedure for carcinoma of the distal bile duct will vary according to the location of the tumor along the biliary tree, the extent of hepatic parenchymal involvement, and the proximity of the tumor to major blood vessels in this region. The regional lymph nodes are assessed at the time of surgery because they have prognostic significance. Patients with cancer of the lower end of the duct and regional lymph node involvement may warrant an extensive resection (Whipple procedure). The 5-year survival outcomes range between 20% and 50%.[[10](#cit/section_5.10),[11](#cit/section_5.11)] Bypass operations or endoluminal stents are alternatives if intraoperatively the tumor is found to be unresectable.[[10](#cit/section_5.10),[11](#cit/section_5.11)]\n\nIn jaundiced patients, the role of percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage or endoscopic placement of a stent for relief of biliary obstruction is controversial, but these options may be considered before surgery, particularly if jaundice is severe or an element of azotemia is present.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[8](#cit/section_5.8)]\n\n#### Adjuvant therapy\n\n##### Chemotherapy\n\nNumerous retrospective series have suggested that adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection may be beneficial.[[12](#cit/section_5.12),[13](#cit/section_5.13)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] However, prospective randomized trials have failed to consistently show a significant benefit in overall survival (OS).\n\nEvidence (chemotherapy):\n\n1. A multicenter phase III study in the United Kingdom (BILCAP) included 447 patients with cholangiocarcinoma or muscle-invasive gallbladder cancer who underwent a macroscopically complete resection with curative intent. Patients were randomly assigned to receive eight cycles of capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice a day on days 1\u221214 of a 21-day cycle) or observation.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] At a median follow-up of 106 months, the following results were observed:\n\n   * There was no statistically significant difference in OS in the intention-to-treat analysis (median OS, 49.6 months in the capecitabine group vs. 36.1 months in the observation group; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67\u22121.06; *P* > .05).\n   * In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 24.3 months (95% CI, 18.6\u201334.6) in the capecitabine group and 17.4 months (95% CI, 11.8\u201323) in the observation group. An adjusted Cox proportional hazards model suggested potential improvement in RFS in the first 24 months from randomization (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57\u20130.96), but with no significant difference in the period after 24 months (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.90\u20132.74).\n2. The open-label, randomized, phase II [STAMP](/clinicaltrials/NCT03079427) study (NCT03079427), presented in abstract form, included 101 patients with perihilar or distal bile duct cancer, at least one regional lymph node metastasis (N1 or greater), and complete macroscopic (R0 or R1) resection within 12 weeks. Patients were assigned to receive either eight cycles of capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2) twice a day on days 1\u201314 of a 21-day cycle (based on the BILCAP trial) or eight cycles of cisplatin (25 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).[[14](#cit/section_5.14)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] At a median follow-up of 28.7 months, the following results were observed:\n\n   * The median DFS was 14.3 months (1-sided 90% CI, 10.7\u201316.5) in the cisplatin-and-gemcitabine group and 11.1 months in the capecitabine group (1-sided 90% CI, 8.4\u201312.7).\n   * The median OS was 35.7 months (1-sided 90% CI, 29.5\u2013not estimated) in the cisplatin-and-gemcitabine group and 35.7 months (1-sided 90% CI, 30.9\u2013not estimated) in the capecitabine group.\n   * The gemcitabine-and-cisplatin group had increased rates of toxicity. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 84% of patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin (most commonly neutropenia) and in 16% of patients who received capecitabine (most commonly hand-foot syndrome).\n   * Given the lack of significant difference in DFS and OS and the higher toxicity rate in the cisplatin-and-gemcitabine group, capecitabine remains the reference standard for adjuvant therapy.\n3. A French multicenter phase III study (PRODIGE 12-ACCORD 18-UNICANCER GI) randomly assigned 196 patients with R0 or R1 resection of localized biliary tract cancer to 12 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) or surveillance. The primary end point was RFS, and the secondary end point was OS.[[15](#cit/section_5.15)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] After a median follow-up of 46.5 months the following results were observed:\n\n   * There was no statistically significant difference in RFS (median, 30.4 months with GEMOX vs. 18.5 months with observation; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.62\u20131.25, *P* = .48).\n   * There was also no statistically significant difference in OS (75.8 months with GEMOX vs. 50.8 months with observation; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.7\u20131.66; *P* = .74).\n4. The Bile Duct Cancer Adjuvant Trial (BCAT), a Japanese, multicenter, phase III study, included 225 patients with resected bile duct cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to six cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine or observation. The primary end point was OS, and the secondary end point was RFS.[[16](#cit/section_5.16)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * There was no significant difference in OS (median, 62.3 months with gemcitabine vs. 63.8 months with observation; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.7\u20131.45; *P* = .964).\n   * No OS differences were observed, even in subgroups stratified by lymph node status and surgical margin status.\n   * There was also no significant difference in RFS (median, 36 months with gemcitabine vs. 39.9 months with observation; HR, 0.93; *P* = .693).\n5. The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer ([ESPAC-3](/clinicaltrials/NCT00058201) trial [NCT00058201]) enrolled 428 patients with periampullary cancer, which included 96 patients with bile duct cancers. Patients were randomly assigned to observation, 6 months of fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin, or 6 months of gemcitabine.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * Among all patients, adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with significant OS benefit when compared with observation. However, after adjusting for prognostic variables by multivariable analysis, a statistically significant OS benefit was associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57\u20130.98; *P* = .03).\n   * In a preplanned subgroup analysis of the 96 patients with bile duct cancer, no benefit was seen among patients treated with chemotherapy. Limitations of this subgroup analysis include limited statistical power and difficulty in differentiating ampullary versus distal common bile duct tumors as the pathological site of origin.\n   * The median survival was 27 months for the observation-alone group, 18 months for the 5-FU-leucovorin group, and 20 months for the gemcitabine-alone group.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)]\n6. A multi-institutional Japanese study compared surgery alone with mitomycin and infusional 5-FU followed by 5-FU until disease progression.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * Among the subset of patients with bile duct cancer (n = 139), no survival benefit was seen.\n\nFor a list of chemotherapy regimens with potential activity, see the [Treatment of Unresectable (Including Metastatic and Recurrent) Bile Duct Cancer](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_501) section.\n\n##### External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)\n\nNumerous retrospective studies have suggested that adding EBRT after complete surgical resection may be beneficial.[[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] However, no prospective randomized trials have demonstrated an OS benefit.\n\nEvidence (EBRT):\n\n1. One small randomized trial of 207 patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancers demonstrated no survival benefit of adding chemoradiation therapy after surgery. This study had limitations: only a few patients had a diagnosis of bile duct cancer, and 20% of the patients randomly assigned to receive chemoradiation therapy did not receive treatment.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n2. A phase II cooperative group trial, [SWOG S0809](/clinicaltrials/NCT00789958) (NCT00789958), evaluated adjuvant capecitabine and gemcitabine followed by chemoradiation therapy for resected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer. In total, 79 eligible patients with pT2 to pT4 disease, node-positive disease, or positive-margin resection were enrolled (extrahepatic bile duct cancer, n = 54; gallbladder cancer, n = 25).[[22](#cit/section_5.22)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The 2-year survival rate of 65% was significantly higher than expected, based on historical controls.[[22](#cit/section_5.22)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n   * Grade 3 toxicity was observed in 52% of patients, and grade 4 toxicity was observed in 11% of patients.\n   * Based on these results, this regimen was observed to be well tolerated, but it needs to be tested in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nAll patients are encouraged to enroll in clinical trials for adjuvant therapies.

[Palliative therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_542).\n2. [Chemotherapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_546).\n3. [Immunotherapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_558).\n4. [Targeted therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_564).\n\n#### Palliative therapy\n\nRelief of biliary obstruction is warranted when symptoms such as pruritus and hepatic dysfunction outweigh other symptoms of the cancer. When possible, such palliation can be achieved with the placement of bile duct stents by operative, endoscopic, or percutaneous techniques.[[1](#cit/section_6.1),[2](#cit/section_6.2)]\n\nPalliative radiation therapy may be beneficial, and patients may be candidates for stereotactic body radiation therapy [[3](#cit/section_6.3)] and intra-arterial embolization.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)]\n\n#### Chemotherapy\n\nSystemic chemotherapy is appropriate for selected patients with adequate performance status and intact organ function.\n\nEvidence (chemotherapy):\n\n1. The phase III [ABC-02](/clinicaltrials/NCT00262769) study (NCT00262769) randomly assigned 410 patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma to receive either cisplatin plus gemcitabine or gemcitabine alone for up to 6 months.[[5](#cit/section_6.5)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The median overall survival (OS) was prolonged in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group (11.7 months) compared with the gemcitabine-alone group (8.1 months) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52\u22120.80; *P* < .001).[[5](#cit/section_6.5)]\n   * A similar median OS benefit was demonstrated in all subgroups, including 73 patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer and 57 patients with hilar tumors.\n   * Grades 3 and 4 toxicities occurred with similar frequencies in both study groups, with the exception of increased hematologic toxicity in the cisplatin-gemcitabine group and increased hepatic toxicity in the gemcitabine-alone group.\n2. A phase II study ([NCT03044587](/clinicaltrials/NCT03044587)) included 91 patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the combination of liposomal irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (arm A) or the ABC-02 study regimen of cisplatin plus gemcitabine (arm B). The primary end point was a prespecified benchmark of a 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 40%.[[6](#cit/section_6.6)][[Level of evidence B3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810031&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The 4-month PFS rate was 51% in arm A. The median PFS was 6 months (95% CI, 2.4\u20139.6) in arm A and 6.9 months (95% CI, 2.5\u20137.9) in arm B.\n   * The median OS was 15.9 months (95% CI, 10.6\u201320.3) in arm A and 13.6 months (95% CI, 6.5\u201317.7) in arm B.\n3. A phase III noninferiority study ([NCT01470443](/clinicaltrials/NCT01470443)) enrolled 114 patients with metastatic biliary tract cancers, including 30 (26%) with primary gallbladder cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) or gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX). The primary end point was 6-month PFS.[[7](#cit/section_6.7)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * OS was not significantly different between treatment groups. It was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0\u221212.6) in the GEMOX group and 10.6 months (95% CI, 7.3\u221215.5) in the XELOX group (*P* = .131).\n   * The PFS rate was 44.6% in the GEMOX group and 46.7% in the XELOX group (95% CI of difference in 6-month PFS rate, -12% to 16%, meeting criteria for noninferiority).\n   * A predefined subgroup analysis based on primary site of disease did not reveal a difference in objective response rate between the two arms in patients with gallbladder cancer (*P* = .598).\n\nPending further clinical trials, cisplatin plus gemcitabine is considered the reference standard first-line chemotherapy backbone for patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer. Following the results of the TOPAZ-1 and KEYNOTE-966 trials, addition of a checkpoint inhibitor (either durvalumab or pembrolizumab) to front-line therapy has become the standard of care (for more information, see the [Immunotherapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_558) section). Potential alternatives include 5-FU plus liposomal irinotecan, gemcitabine plus capecitabine, GEMOX, and XELOX. All patients should consider clinical trials.\n\nThere is limited high-quality evidence to guide selection of a second-line regimen in refractory disease:\n\n1. A multicenter phase III trial in the United Kingdom ([ABC-06](/clinicaltrials/NCT01926236) [NCT01926236]) included 162 patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer and documented radiological disease progression on first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin) with active symptom control (ASC) or ASC alone. The following results were observed after a median follow-up of 21.7 months:[[8](#cit/section_6.8)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The median OS was significantly longer in the FOLFOX group (6.2 months) than in the ASC-alone group (5.3 months) (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50\u22120.97; *P* = .031). In the FOLFOX group, the OS rate was 50.6% at 6 months and 25.9% at 12 months, compared with 35.5% at 6 months and 11.4% at 12 months in the ASC-alone group.\n   * Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were reported in 56 patients (69%) in the FOLFOX group, compared with 42 patients (52%) in the ASC-alone group. The most frequently reported grade 3 to 5 FOLFOX-related adverse events were neutropenia (12%), fatigue/lethargy (11%), and infection (10%). There were three chemotherapy-related deaths, one each due to infection, acute kidney injury, and febrile neutropenia.\n\n   Two phase II trials have evaluated 5-FU and leucovorin with or without liposomal irinotecan, but results differed.\n2. A multicenter phase IIb trial in South Korea ([NIFTY](/clinicaltrials/NCT03524508) [NCT03524508]) randomly assigned 174 patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer that had progressed during first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine to receive 5-FU and leucovorin with or without liposomal irinotecan. The following was observed after a median follow-up of 6.1 months:[[9](#cit/section_6.9)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The primary end point of median PFS was significantly longer in the group who received liposomal irinotecan (3.9 months) compared with the group who received 5-FU plus leucovorin alone (1.6 months) (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, not reported; *P* = .0001). A secondary end point of median OS was also significantly longer in the group who received liposomal irinotecan (8.6 months) compared with the group who received 5-FU plus leucovorin alone (5.3 months) (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, not reported; *P* = .024).\n3. The German multicenter phase II [NALIRICC](/clinicaltrials/NCT03043547) trial (NCT03043547) included 100 patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer that progressed during gemcitabine-based therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5-FU plus leucovorin with or without liposomal irinotecan.[[10](#cit/section_6.10)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The median PFS in the liposomal irinotecan group was 2.6 months, compared with 2.3 months in the 5-FU\u2013leucovorin-alone group (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.56\u20131.35; *P* not reported). The median OS was 6.9 months in the liposomal irinotecan group and 8.2 months in the 5-FU\u2013leucovorin-alone group (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.68\u20131.72; *P* not reported).\n   * Toxicity was significantly higher in the liposomal irinotecan group, with treatment-related serious adverse events occurring in 16 patients (33%), compared with one patient (2%) in the 5-FU\u2013leucovorin-alone group. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the liposomal irinotecan group were neutropenia (17%), diarrhea (15%), and nausea (8%).\n\n#### Immunotherapy\n\nBased on results from the TOPAZ-1 and KEYNOTE-966 trials, all patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent disease should consider treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor (either durvalumab or pembrolizumab) with cisplatin and gemcitabine (the previous standard-of-care doublet) in the first-line setting.[[11](#cit/section_6.11)-[13](#cit/section_6.13)]\n\nEvidence (immunotherapy):\n\n1. An international, multicenter, phase III study ([TOPAZ-1](/clinicaltrials/NCT03875235) [NCT03875235]) included 685 patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancer that was unresectable and previously untreated. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either durvalumab or placebo with cisplatin plus gemcitabine for up to eight cycles, followed by durvalumab or placebo maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was OS. After a median follow-up of 23.4 months for patients in the durvalumab arm, the following results were observed:[[12](#cit/section_6.12),[13](#cit/section_6.13)]\n\n   * The median OS was significantly improved in the durvalumab group (12.9 months) compared with the placebo group (11.3 months) (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.91). In the durvalumab group, the 18-month OS rate was 35.1% and the 24-month OS rate was 24.9%. In the placebo group, the 18-month OS rate was 25.5% and the 24-month OS rate was 10.4%.[[12](#cit/section_6.12),[13](#cit/section_6.13)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n   * There was no significant difference between groups in the number of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events or the number of events leading to discontinuation of a study medication.\n2. An international, multicenter, phase III study ([KEYNOTE-966](/clinicaltrials/NCT04003636) [NCT04003636]) enrolled 1,069 patients with previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 35 cycles. This was combined with gemcitabine (with no maximum duration) and cisplatin for up to 8 cycles. After a median follow-up of 25.6 months, the following results were observed:[[11](#cit/section_6.11)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The median OS was 12.7 months in the pembrolizumab group and 10.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.95; one-sided *P* = .0034).\n   * There was no difference in the total frequency of treatment-related adverse events between treatment groups, including grade 3 or grade 4 events. Death due to treatment-related adverse events was seen in a total of eight patients (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm and three patients (1%) in the placebo arm.\n\nAll patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent disease who have not already received a checkpoint inhibitor should have molecular testing for deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Extrapolating from a subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors in the [I-PREDICT](/clinicaltrials/NCT02534675) (NCT02534675) and [KEYNOTE-158](/clinicaltrials/NCT02628067) (NCT02628067) studies, patients with either dMMR or MSI-H tumors can consider pembrolizumab treatment.[[14](#cit/section_6.14),[15](#cit/section_6.15)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n#### Targeted therapy\n\nPatients with targetable pathogenic variants can consider clinical trials of investigational therapies. Currently, targeted therapies have only been approved for patients whose disease has progressed or who are ineligible for first-line therapies.\n\n##### IDH1 inhibitors\n\nUp to 15% of bile duct cancers have *IDH1* variants.\n\nEvidence (IDH1 inhibitors):\n\n1. The phase III [ClarIDHy](/clinicaltrials/NCT02989857) trial (NCT02989857) included 187 patients with cholangiocarcinoma and *IDH1* variants. Patients had disease that had progressed during previous systemic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib or placebo. The primary end point was PFS.[[16](#cit/section_6.16),[17](#cit/section_6.17)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The median PFS was improved among patients treated with ivosidenib (2.7 months) compared with placebo (1.4 months) (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25\u22120.54; *P* < .001). PFS rates at 6 months and 12 months were 32% and 21.9%, respectively, in the ivosidenib arm. No patients in the placebo group were progression free at 6 months.\n   * In the intention-to-treat analysis, median OS was 10.3 months in the ivosidenib group compared with 7.5 months for the placebo group (HR, 0.79; one-sided *P* = .09), despite crossover of 57% of placebo patients to ivosidenib. When adjusted for crossover, median OS for the placebo group was 5.1 months.\n   * Grades 3 and 4 toxicities occurred in 46% of patients in the ivosidenib group and 36% of patients in the placebo group.\n\n##### FGFR inhibitors\n\n*FGFR2* gene fusions are present in approximately 15% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Multiple phase II trials, some reported in abstract form, have suggested activity of FGFR inhibitors in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and *FGFR2* fusions whose disease progressed after or who were ineligible for first-line chemotherapy.[[18](#cit/section_6.18),[19](#cit/section_6.19)]\n\nEvidence (FGFR inhibitors):\n\n1. The multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II [FIGHT-202](/clinicaltrials/NCT02924376) trial (NCT02924376) enrolled 147 patients with disease progression during or after at least one previous therapy. A total of 108 patients had *FGFR2* rearrangements or fusions. All patients received 13.5 mg of pemigatinib orally once daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off therapy. At a median follow-up of 45.4 months, the following results were observed:[[20](#cit/section_6.20)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The overall response rate in the cohort of patients with *FGFR2* rearrangements/fusions was 37% (95% CI, 27.9%\u221246.9%), including three complete responses. Among the 40 patients who achieved an objective response, the median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.0\u201314.5).\n   * The median PFS in patients with *FGFR2* rearrangements or fusions was 7.0 months (95% CI, 6.1\u201310.5), and the median OS was 17.5 months (95% CI, 14.4\u201322.9). Given the single-arm study design, the relative effect of pemigatinib on PFS and OS was not established. However, in the cohort of study patients whose tumors did not harbor *FGFR* rearrangements, the median PFS was only 1.5 months and the median OS was only 4.0 months.\n   * The most common adverse effect was hyperphosphatemia, occurring in 58.5% of patients, although no adverse effect was grade 3 or higher. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 10.2% of patients, dose reduction in 13.64% of patients, and dose interruptions in 42.2% of patients.\n\n   In 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pemigatinib for the treatment of adults with previously treated unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an *FGFR2* fusion or other rearrangement.\n2. Futibatinib is an irreversible noncompetitive inhibitor of FGFR1\u20134. Preclinical *in vitro* studies showed that futibatinib was less susceptible to on-target resistance variants than pemigatinib. However, there are no head-to-head clinical trial data comparing outcomes for the various FGFR inhibitors. The multinational, open-label, single-group, phase II [FOENIX-CCA2](/clinicaltrials/NCT02052778) trial (NCT02052778) evaluated futibatinib in patients with previously treated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and *FGFR2* fusions or rearrangements. The study enrolled 103 patients with disease progression after at least one previous line of systemic therapy. All patients received futibatinib at a continuous dose of 20 mg once daily.[[21](#cit/section_6.21)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The overall response rate was 42% (95% CI, 31.1%\u201350.4%), including one complete response. Of the patients who had a response, the median duration of response was 9.7 months.\n   * The median PFS was 9 months (95% CI, 6.9\u201313.1), and the median OS was 21.7 months (95% CI 14.5\u2013NR). Given the single-arm study design, the relative effect of futibatinib on PFS and OS has not yet been established.\n   * The most common adverse effect of any grade was hyperphosphatemia, which occurred in 85% of patients and was grade 3 in 30% of patients. Other common adverse effects included alopecia (33%), dry mouth (30%), dry skin (27%), and fatigue (25%). Other notable grade 3 toxicities included aspartate aminotransferase elevation (7%) and stomatitis (6%). Treatment-related adverse events led to dose interruptions in 50% of patients, dose reductions in 54% of patients, and permanent drug discontinuation in 2% of patients.\n\nPatients with *FGFR2* fusion\u2212positive disease should be encouraged to enroll in a clinical trial.\n\n##### HER2-targeted therapy\n\n1. The international, multicenter, single-arm, phase IIb [HERIZON-BTC-01](/clinicaltrials/NCT04466891) trial (NCT04466891) enrolled 87 patients with HER2-amplified (by fluorescence *in situ* hybridization), unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer whose disease progressed on prior gemcitabine-based therapy. Cohort 1 included 80 patients with HER2 2+ or 3+ expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while cohort 2 included seven patients with HER2 0+ or 1+ expression by IHC. All patients received zanidatamab, a bispecific antibody targeting two distinct HER2 epitopes, at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. At a median follow-up of 12.4 months, the following results were observed:[[22](#cit/section_6.22)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * In cohort 1, the objective response rate was 41.3% (95% CI, 30.4%\u201352.8%). The median duration of response was 12.9 months (95% CI, 6.0\u2013not reached).\n   * The median PFS was 5.5 months in cohort 1 (95% CI, 3.7\u20137.2) and 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.2\u2013not estimable) in cohort 2.\n   * Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 8% of patients. Zanidatamab was discontinued in two patients: one due to reduced ejection fraction and one due to pneumonitis. Diarrhea (37%) and infusion reactions with the first cycle (33%) were relatively common, but mostly low-grade.\n   * The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for zanidatamab in this setting, but it is not yet FDA approved.\n\nAlthough not FDA approved specifically for biliary tract cancer, a growing body of evidence demonstrated activity of the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors.\n\n1. The [DESTINY-PanTumor02](/clinicaltrials/NCT04482309) trial (NCT04482309), reported in abstract form, was tumor-agnostic (enrolled patients with HER2-positive tumors from any site) but included a subset of 41 patients with biliary tract cancer.[[23](#cit/section_6.23)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * The overall response rate was 22% in this subset of patients.\n2. The phase II [HERB](/clinicaltrials/NCT04482309) trial (NCT04482309) enrolled 32 patients (24 with HER2-positive disease, 8 with HER2-low disease) with biliary tract cancers refractory to, or intolerant of, a gemcitabine-containing regimen. All patients received trastuzumab deruxtecan.[[24](#cit/section_6.24)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * Among the patients with HER2-positive disease, the overall response rate was 36.4%. The median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.0\u20137.3), and the median OS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.7\u201314.6).\n   * Among the small sample of eight patients with HER2-low disease, the overall response rate was 12.5%. The median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 1.2\u20135.5), and the median OS was 8.9 months (95% CI, 3.0\u201312.8).\n\nSimilarly, the combination of tucatinib and trastuzumab\u2014which the FDA has not approved for the treatment of biliary tract cancer but has approved for breast and colorectal cancer indications\u2014was shown to have potential activity in previously treated patients.\n\n1. The tumor-agnostic phase II [SGNTUC-019](/clinicaltrials/NCT04579380) study (NCT04579380) evaluated the combination of tucatinib and trastuzumab. The trial included a cohort of 30 patients with previously treated HER2-overexpressing or HER2-amplified biliary tract cancer.[[25](#cit/section_6.25)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]\n\n   * At a median follow-up of 10.8 months, the objective response rate was 46.7% (90% CI, 30.8%\u201363.0%), with a disease control rate of 76.7% (90% CI, 60.6%\u201388.5%).\n   * The median PFS was 5.5 months (90% CI, 3.9\u20138.2).\n   * The most common treatment-related adverse events were pyrexia (43.3%) and diarrhea (40%). Adverse events caused no deaths but led one patient to discontinue treatment.\n\nPatients with HER2-amplified disease are candidates for clinical trials.\n\nAll patients are encouraged to enroll in clinical trials for adjuvant therapies.

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above.\n\n**[Treatment of Unresectable (Including Metastatic and Recurrent) Bile Duct Cancer](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_501)**\n\nAdded [text](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_549) about the results of a phase II study that randomly assigned 91 patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma to receive the combination of liposomal irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin or the ABC-02 study regimen of cisplatin plus gemcitabine (cited Ettrich et al. as reference 6 and level of evidence B3).\n\nAdded [text](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_637) to state that two phase II trials have evaluated 5-FU and leucovorin with or without liposomal irinotecan, but results differed. Also added text about a phase II trial that included 100 patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer that progressed during gemcitabine-based therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5-FU plus leucovorin with or without liposomal irinotecan (cited Vogel [Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol 2024] et al. as reference 10 and level of evidence A1).\n\nRevised [text](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_591) about the results of a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II trial of pemigatinib that included 147 patients with disease progression during or after at least one previous therapy (cited Vogel [ESMO Open 2024] et al. as reference 20).\n\nRevised [text](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_613) about the results of a phase II trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan in 32 patients with biliary tract cancers refractory to, or intolerant of, a gemcitabine-containing regimen (cited Ohba et al. as reference 24).\n\nThis summary is written and maintained by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment \"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment\"), which is editorially independent of NCI.

This change may or may not be caused by the intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Age or age group\n\nA type of eligibility criteria that indicates the age a person must be to participate in a clinical study. This may be indicated by a specific age or the following age groups:\nThe age groups are:\n\n    *   Child (birth-17)\n    *   Adult (18-64)\n    *   Older Adult (65+)\n\n*   All-cause mortality A measure of all deaths, due to any cause, that occur during a clinical study. \n*   Allocation A method used to assign participants to an arm of a clinical study. The types of allocation are randomized allocation and nonrandomized. \n*   Arm A group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives a specific intervention/treatment, or no intervention, according to the trial's protocol. \n*   Arm type A general description of the clinical trial arm. It identifies the role of the intervention that participants receive. Types of arms include experimental arm, active comparator arm, placebo comparator arm, sham comparator arm, and no intervention arm. \n*   Baseline characteristics Data collected at the beginning of a clinical study for all participants and for each arm or comparison group. These data include demographics, such as age, sex/gender, race and ethnicity, and study-specific measures (for example, systolic blood pressure, prior antidepressant treatment). \n*   Canceled submission Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator recalled a submission of study results before quality control (QC) review took place. If the submission was canceled on or after May 8, 2018, the date is shown. After submission of study results, a study record cannot be modified until QC review is completed, unless the submission is canceled. \n*   Certain agreements Information required by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In general, this is a description of any agreement between the sponsor of a clinical study and the principal investigator (PI) that does not allow the PI to discuss the results of the study or publish the study results in a scientific or academic journal after the study is completed. \n*   Certification A sponsor or investigator may submit a certification to delay submission of results information if they are applying for FDA approval of a new drug or device, or new use of an already approved drug or device. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after the certification/extension first submitted date, unless certain events occur sooner. See [Delay Results Type](https://clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information about this certification. \n*   Certification/extension first posted The date on which information about a certification to delay submission of results or an extension request was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov. ClinicalTrials.gov does not indicate whether the submission was a certification or extension request. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the certification or extension request and the first posted date. \n*   Certification/extension first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request to delay submission of results. A sponsor or investigator who submits a certification can delay results submission up to 2 years after this date, unless certain events occur sooner. There is typically a delay between the date the certification or extension request was submitted and the date the information is first available on ClinicalTrials.gov (certification/extension first posted). \n*   Certification/extension first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a certification or an extension request that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a certification or extension request one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. Meeting QC criteria for an extension request does not mean that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has determined that the request demonstrates good cause. The process for review and granting of extension requests by the NIH is being developed. \n*   Clinical study A research study involving human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two types of clinical studies: interventional studies (also called clinical trials) and observational studies. \n*   Clinical trial Another name for an interventional study. \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number)The unique identification code given to each clinical study upon registration at ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). \n*   Collaborator An organization other than the sponsor that provides support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. \n*   Condition/disease The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. On ClinicalTrials.gov, conditions may also include other health-related issues, such as lifespan, quality of life, and health risks. \n*   Contact The name and contact information for the person who can answer enrollment questions for a clinical study. Each location where the study is being conducted may also have a specific contact, who may be better able to answer those questions. \n*   Cross-over assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive two or more interventions in a specific order. For example, two-by-two cross-over assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A during the initial phase of the trial, followed by drug B during a later phase. The other group receives drug B during the initial phase, followed by drug A. So during the trial, participants \"cross over\" to the other drug. All participants receive drug A and drug B at some point during the trial but in a different order, depending on the group to which they are assigned. \n*   Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)A group of independent scientists who monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a clinical trial. The DMC can recommend to the sponsor that the trial be stopped if it is not effective, is harming participants, or is unlikely to serve its scientific purpose. Members are chosen based on the scientific skills and knowledge needed to monitor the particular trial. Also called a data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB. \n*   Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0)A phase of research used to describe exploratory trials conducted before traditional phase 1 trials to investigate how or whether a drug affects the body. They involve very limited human exposure to the drug and have no therapeutic or diagnostic goals (for example, screening studies, microdose studies). \n*   Eligibility criteria The key requirements that people who want to participate in a clinical study must meet or the characteristics they must have. Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating). Types of eligibility criteria include whether a study  accepts healthy volunteers, has age or age group requirements, or is limited by sex. \n*   Enrollment The number of participants in a clinical study. The \"estimated\" enrollment is the target number of participants that the researchers need for the study. \n*   Exclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria. These are reasons that a person is not allowed to participate in a clinical study. \n*   Expanded access A way for patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial to gain access to a medical product that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also called compassionate use. There are different expanded access types. \nFor more information, see FDA [Expanded Access: Information for Patients](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access \"Expanded Access: Information for Patients (opens in a new tab)\"). \n*   Expanded access status\n\n    *   **Available:**Expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment, and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug, biologic, or medical device being studied.\n    *   **No longer available:**Expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future.\n    *   **Temporarily not available:**Expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future.\n    *   **Approved for marketing:** The intervention has been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the public.\n\n*   Expanded access type\n\nDescribes the category of expanded access under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. There are three types of expanded access: \n    *   **Individual Patients**: Allows a single patient, with a serious disease or condition who cannot participate in a clinical trial, access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This category also includes access in an emergency situation.\n    *   **Intermediate-size Population**: Allows more than one patient (but generally fewer patients than through a Treatment IND/Protocol) access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access is used when multiple patients with the same disease or condition seek access to a specific drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA.\n    *   **[](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)Treatment IND/Protocol**: Allows a large, widespread population access to a drug or biological product that has not been approved by the FDA. This type of expanded access can only be provided if the product is already being developed for marketing for the same use as the expanded access use.\n\n*   Experimental arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives the intervention/treatment that is the focus of the clinical trial. \n*   Extension request In certain circumstances, a sponsor or investigator may request an extension to delay the standard results submission deadline (generally one year after the primary completion date). The request for an extension must demonstrate good cause (for example, the need to preserve the scientific integrity of an ongoing masked trial). All requests must be reviewed and granted by the National Institutes of Health. This process for review and granting of extension requests is being developed. See [Delay Results Type](https://clinicaltrials.gov/policy/results-definitions#DelayResultsType) in the Results Data Element definitions for more information. \n*   Facility name The name of the hospital or institution where a clinical study takes place. Note that not all study records include this information. To use this filter, you can enter some or all of a facility name, or type a few letters and select from the list that appears. \n*   Factorial assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which groups of participants receive one of several combinations of interventions. For example, two-by-two factorial assignment involves four groups of participants. Each group receives one of the following pairs of interventions: (1) drug A and drug B, (2) drug A and a placebo, (3) a placebo and drug B, or (4) a placebo and a placebo. So during the trial, all possible combinations of the two drugs (A and B) and the placebos are given to different groups of participants. \n*   FDAAA 801 Violations\n\nA FDAAA 801 Violation is shown on a study record when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Notice of Noncompliance to the responsible party of an applicable clinical trial. A Notice of Noncompliance indicates that the FDA has determined the responsible party was not in compliance with the registration or results reporting requirements for the clinical trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801).\nThe National Library of Medicine (NLM) is required by FDAAA 801 to add information to a study record about any FDAAA 801 Violation. This information is provided by the FDA. There are three categories of information that may be included:\n\n    *   Violation: Shown when the FDA issues a Notice of Noncompliance and posts the Notice of Noncompliance on its designated webpage. There are three types of violations:\n        *   Failure to submit required clinical trial information\n        *   Submission of false or misleading clinical trial information\n        *   Failure to submit primary and secondary outcomes\n\n    *   Correction: Shown when the FDA confirms that the responsible party has updated the study record to correct the violation and posts the correction notice on its designated webpage. Because of the time for FDA review and processing, there may be a delay between the date when the study record was updated and the addition of correction information to the FDAAA 801 Violation information. \n    *   Penalty: Shown when the FDA imposes a penalty for the violation and posts the penalty notice on its designated webpage.\n\n*   First posted The date on which the study record was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/protocol-registration-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay of a few days between the date the study sponsor or investigator submitted the study record and the first posted date. \n*   First submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submitted a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the first submitted date and the record's availability on ClinicalTrials.gov (the first posted date). \n*   First submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. The sponsor or investigator may need to revise and submit a study record one or more times before NLM's QC review criteria are met. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, Section 801 (FDAAA 801)U.S. Public Law 110-85, which was enacted on September 27, 2007. Section 801 of FDAAA amends Section 402 of the U.S. Public Health Service Act to expand ClinicalTrials.gov and create a clinical study results database. For more information on FDAAA 801, see the [Clinical Trial Reporting Requirements](https://clinicaltrials.gov/policy/reporting-requirements#final-rule) page on this site. \n*   Funder type\n\nDescribes the organization that provides funding or support for a clinical study. This support may include activities related to funding, design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting. Organizations listed as sponsors and collaborators for a study are considered the funders of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov refers to four types of funders: \n    *   U.S. National Institutes of Health\n    *   Other U.S. Federal agencies (for example, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs)\n    *   Industry (for example: pharmaceutical and device companies)\n    *   All others (including individuals, universities, and community-based organizations)\n\n*   Gender-based eligibility A type of eligibility criteria that indicates whether eligibility to participate in a clinical study is based on a person's self-representation of gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's own sense of gender, which may or may not be the same as their biological sex. \n*   Group/cohort A group or subgroup of participants in an observational study that is assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. \n*   Human subjects protection review board A group of people who review, approve, and monitor the clinical study's protocol. Their role is to protect the rights and welfare of people participating in a study (referred to as human research subjects), such as reviewing the informed consent form. The group typically includes people with varying backgrounds, including a community member, to make sure that research activities conducted by an organization are completely and adequately reviewed. Also called an institutional review board, or IRB, or an ethics committee.\nFor more information, see [Who can join clinical research?](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/learn-about-studies#q3) on this site. \n*   Inclusion criteria A type of eligibility criteria.

Types of intervention models include: single group assignment, parallel assignment, cross-over assignment, and factorial assignment. \n*   Intervention/treatment A process or action that is the focus of a clinical study. Interventions include drugs, medical devices, procedures, vaccines, and other products that are either investigational or already available. Interventions can also include noninvasive approaches, such as education or modifying diet and exercise. \n*   Interventional study (clinical trial)A type of clinical study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or more intervention/treatment (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study's protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions. \n*   Investigator A researcher involved in a clinical study. Related terms include site principal investigator, site sub-investigator, study chair, study director, and study principal investigator. \n*   Last update posted The most recent date on which changes to a study record were made available on ClinicalTrials.gov. There may be a delay between when the changes were submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov by the study's sponsor or investigator (the last update submitted date) and the last update posted date. \n*   Last update submitted The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record to ClinicalTrials.gov. There is typically a delay of a few days between the last update submitted date and when the date changes are posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (the last update posted date). \n*   Last update submitted that met QC criteria The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator submitted changes to a study record that are consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria. It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Last verified The most recent date on which the study sponsor or investigator confirmed the information about a clinical study on ClinicalTrials.gov as accurate and current. If a study with a recruitment status of recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting has not been confirmed within the past 2 years, the study's recruitment status is shown as unknown. \n*   Location A place where a research site for a clinical study can be found. Location information can be searched using a facility name, a city, state, zip code, or country. A location where a study is being conducted may also include contact information.  \n*   Location countries Countries in which research facilities for a study are located. A country is listed only once, even if there is more than one facility in the country. The list includes all countries as of the last update submitted date; any country for which all facilities were removed from the study record are listed under removed location countries. \n*   Masking A clinical trial design strategy in which one or more parties involved in the trial, such as the investigator or participants, do not know which participants have been assigned which interventions. Types of masking include: open label, single blind masking, and double-blind masking. \n*   NCT number A unique identification code given to each clinical study record registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The format is \"NCT\" followed by an 8-digit number (for example, NCT00000419). Also called the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. \n*   No intervention arm An arm type in which a group of participants does not receive any intervention/treatment during the clinical trial. \n*   Observational study A type of clinical study in which participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not assign participants to a specific interventions/treatment.\nA patient registry is a type of observational study. \n*   Observational study model The general design of the strategy for identifying and following up with participants during an observational study. Types of observational study models include cohort, case-control, case-only, case-cross-over, ecologic or community studies, family-based, and other. \n*   Other adverse event An adverse event that is not a serious adverse event, meaning that it does not result in death, is not life-threatening, does not require inpatient hospitalization or extend a current hospital stay, does not result in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interfere substantially with normal life functions, and does not cause a congenital anomaly or birth defect; it also does not put the participant in danger and does not require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Other study IDs Identifiers or ID numbers other than the NCT number that are assigned to a clinical study by the study's sponsor, funders, or others. These numbers may include unique identifiers from other trial registries and National Institutes of Health grant numbers. \n*   Other terms In the search feature, the Other terms field is used to narrow a search. For example, you may enter the name of a drug or the NCT number of a clinical study to limit the search to study records that contain these words. \n*   Outcome measure For clinical trials, a planned measurement described in the protocol that is used to determine the effect of an intervention/treatment on participants. For observational studies, a measurement or observation that is used to describe patterns of diseases or traits, or associations with exposures, risk factors, or treatment. Types of outcome measures include primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measure. \n*   Parallel assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions. For example, a two-arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants. One group receives drug A, and the other group receives drug B. So during the trial, participants in one group receive drug A \"in parallel\" to participants in the other group, who receive drug B. \n*   Participant flow A summary of the progress of participants through each stage of a clinical study, by study arm or group/cohort. This includes the number of participants who started, completed, and dropped out of the study. \n*   Patient registry A type of observational study that collects information about patients' medical conditions and/or treatments to better understand how a condition or treatment affects patients in the real world. \n*   Phase The stage of a clinical trial studying a drug or biological product, based on definitions developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. There are five phases: Early Phase 1 (formerly listed as Phase 0), Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4. Not Applicable is used to describe trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Phase 1 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants. \n*   Phase 2 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared to similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short-term adverse events are studied. \n*   Phase 3 A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather more information about a drug's safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. These studies typically involve more participants. \n*   Phase 4 A phase of research to describe clinical trials occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing. They include postmarket requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the study sponsor. These trials gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. \n*   Phase Not Applicable Describes trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions. \n*   Placebo An inactive substance or treatment that looks the same as, and is given in the same way as, an active drug or intervention/treatment being studied. \n*   Placebo comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a placebo during a clinical trial. \n*   Primary completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention to collect final data for the primary outcome measure. Whether the clinical study ended according to the protocol or was terminated does not affect this date. For clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with different completion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collection is completed for all the primary outcome measures. The \"estimated\" primary completion date is the date that the researchers think will be the primary completion date for the study.  \n*   Primary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, the planned outcome measure that is the most important for evaluating the effect of an intervention/treatment. Most clinical studies have one primary outcome measure, but some have more than one. \n*   Primary purpose The main reason for the clinical trial. The types of primary purpose are: treatment, prevention, diagnostic, supportive care, screening, health services research, basic science, and other. \n*   Principal investigator (PI)The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. \n*   Protocol The written description of a clinical study. It includes the study's objectives, design, and methods. It may also include relevant scientific background and statistical information. \n*   Quality control (QC) review National Library of Medicine (NLM) staff perform a limited review of submitted study records for apparent errors, deficiencies, or inconsistencies. NLM staff identify potential major and advisory issues and provide comments directly to the study sponsor or investigator. Major issues identified in QC review must be addressed or corrected (see First submitted that met QC criteria and Results first submitted that met QC criteria). Advisory issues are suggestions to help improve the clarity of the record. NLM staff do not verify the scientific validity or relevance of the submitted information. The study sponsor or investigator is responsible for ensuring that the studies follow all applicable laws and regulations. \n*   Randomized allocation A type of allocation strategy in which participants are assigned to the arms of a clinical trial by chance. \n*   Recruitment status\n\n    *   **Not yet recruiting:** The study has not started recruiting participants.\n    *   **Recruiting:** The study is currently recruiting participants.\n    *   **Enrolling by invitation:** The study is selecting its participants from a population, or group of people, decided on by the researchers in advance. These studies are not open to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria but only to people in that particular population, who are specifically invited to participate.\n    *   **Active, not recruiting:** The study is ongoing, and participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but potential participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled.\n    *   **Suspended:** The study has stopped early but may start again.\n    *   **Terminated:** The study has stopped early and will not start again. Participants are no longer being examined or treated.\n    *   **Completed:** The study has ended normally, and participants are no longer being examined or treated (that is, the last participant's last visit has occurred).\n    *   **Withdrawn:** The study stopped early, before enrolling its first participant.\n    *   **Unknown:** A study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been last verified within the past 2 years.\n\n*   Registration The process of submitting and updating summary information about a clinical study and its protocol, from its beginning to end, to a structured, public Web-based study registry that is accessible to the public, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. \n*   Removed location countries Countries that appeared under location countries but were removed from the study record by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Reporting group A grouping of participants in a clinical study that is used for summarizing the data collected during the study.

Older studies are unlikely to have results available in the database. \n*   Results delayed Indicates that the sponsor or investigator submitted a certification or extension request. \n*   Results first posted The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov after National Library of Medicine (NLM) [quality control (QC) review](https://clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) has concluded. There is typically a delay between the date the study sponsor or investigator first submits summary results information (the results first submitted date) and the results first posted date. Some results information may be available at an earlier date if Results First Posted with QC Comments. \n*   Results first posted with QC comments The date on which summary results information was first available on ClinicalTrials.gov with quality control review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) identifying major issues that must be addressed by the sponsor or investigator. As of January 1, 2020, initial results submissions for applicable clinical trials (ACTs) that do not meet [quality control review criteria](https://clinicaltrials.gov/submit-studies/prs-help/results-quality-control-review-criteria) will be publicly posted on ClinicalTrials.gov with brief standardized major comments. Accordingly, the Results First Posted with QC Comments date may be earlier than the Results First Posted date for an ACT with summary results information that is not consistent with NLM quality control review criteria. \n*   Results first submitted The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information. There is typically a delay between the results first submitted date and when summary results information becomes available on ClinicalTrials.gov (the results first posted date). \n*   Results first submitted that met QC criteria The date on which the study sponsor or investigator first submits a study record with summary results information that is consistent with National Library of Medicine (NLM) quality control (QC) review criteria.

It is the responsibility of the sponsor or investigator to ensure that the study record is consistent with the NLM QC review criteria. \n*   Results returned after quality control review The date on which the National Library of Medicine provided quality control (QC) review comments to the study sponsor or investigator. The sponsor or investigator must address major issues identified in the review comments. If there is a date listed for results returned after quality control review, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, this means that the submission is pending changes by the sponsor or investigator. \n*   Results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov Indicates that the study sponsor or investigator has submitted summary results information for a clinical study to ClinicalTrials.gov but the quality control (QC) review process has not concluded.\nThe results submitted date indicates when the study sponsor or investigator first submitted summary results information or submitted changes to summary results information. Submissions with changes are typically in response to QC review comments from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). If there is a date listed for results submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, but there is not a subsequent date listed for results returned after quality control review, this means that the submission is pending review by NLM. \n*   Secondary outcome measure In a clinical study's protocol, a planned outcome measure that is not as important as the primary outcome measure for evaluating the effect of an intervention but is still of interest. Most clinical studies have more than one secondary outcome measure. \n*   Serious adverse event An adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. \n*   Sex A type of eligibility criteria that indicates the sex of people who may participate in a clinical study (all, female, male). Sex is a person's classification as female or male based on biological distinctions. Sex is distinct from gender-based eligibility. \n*   Sham comparator arm An arm type in which a group of participants receives a procedure or device that appears to be the same as the actual procedure or device being studied but does not contain active processes or components. \n*   Single group assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which all participants receive the same intervention/treatment. \n*   Sort studies by\n\nThe Sort studies by option is used to change the order of studies listed on the Search Results page. You can sort by Relevance or Newest First: \n    *   Relevance: Studies that best match your search terms appear higher in the search results list. This is the default display for all searches.\n    *   Newest First: Studies with the most recent First posted dates appear higher in the search results list.\n\n*   Sponsor The organization or person who initiates the study and who has authority and control over the study. \n*   Statistical analysis plan (SAP)The written description of the statistical considerations and methods for analyzing the data collected in the clinical study. \n*   Status Indicates the current recruitment status or the expanded access status. \n*   Study completion date The date on which the last participant in a clinical study was examined or received an intervention/treatment to collect final data for the primary outcome measures, secondary outcome measures, and adverse events (that is, the last participant's last visit).

Registration must occur within 180 days after diagnosis of metastatic or stage IV solid tumor or treatment-requiring hematologic malignancy. Patients with indolent hematologic diseases undergoing observation alone are not eligible; patients with previously diagnosed hematologic cancers progressed to the point of requiring systemic therapy are eligible, so long as the progression occurred within the previous 180 days. Biopsy confirmation of metastatic disease is not required\n*   Patients with recurrent solid tumors will be allowed as long as 1) this is the first presentation of metastatic disease and 2) the diagnosis of the metastasis is at least 180 days (6 months) after the diagnosis date of the previous earlier stage cancer\n*   Patients with a history of secondary malignancy are allowed as long as they were not diagnosed within the previous 24 months, are not on active therapy, and are disease-free. Patients with adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, and in situ cervical cancer at any point prior to enrollment are eligible\n*   Patients who have started anti-cancer treatment for the current diagnosis must have started within 90 days prior to registration\n*   Patients who are planning to start anti-cancer treatment for the current diagnosis must start within (=<) 30 days after registration\n*   Patients are allowed to be co-enrolled on other clinical trials (including non-treatment studies and studies that may or may not include investigational drugs)\n*   Patients must be at least 18 years of age\n*   Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2\n*   Patients must complete the baseline patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires prior to registration and must be able to complete questionnaires in English or Spanish\n*   Patients must provide their full name, primary address in the United States (U.S.), birth date and social security number at registration for the purposes of accessing credit report data. (This may be obtained directly from the patient, study questionnaires, or the medical record)\n*   Patients must provide email and/or telephone number for the purposes of being contacted by financial navigators Spouse/partner caregiver participation is optional.\n*   Spouse/partner caregiver must be living in the same household as the eligible patient and be either legally married, in a common law marriage, or be an intimate partner/significant other of the participant*\n*   Spouse/partner caregivers must be at least 18 years of age\n*   Spouse/partner caregivers must provide their full name, primary address in the U.S., birth date and social security number at registration for the purposes of accessing credit report data\n*   Spouse/partner caregivers must provide email and/or telephone number for the purposes of being contacted by the financial navigators\n*   Spouse/partner caregivers must be able to complete questionnaires in English or Spanish and must complete the baseline questionnaires prior to patient registration\n\n*The study team acknowledges that other types of caregivers may also face financial hardship following a patient's cancer diagnosis and may similarly benefit from financial education and navigation. The decision to focus solely on spouse or partner caregivers was scientific, to understand how caregivers who share household finances experience financial hardship.\n\n*   Participants (patients and caregivers, when participating) must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Use of legally-authorized representative is not permissible for this study. Documentation of informed consent via remote consent is permissible\n*   As a part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) registration process the treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n*   Patients may not be enrolled in hospice care at the time of registration\n*   Non-spouse/partner caregivers such as friends, adult children, parents, or other relatives living in the same household as the patient are not eligible\n\nAges Eligible for Study \n\n18 Years and older (Adult,Older Adult) \n\nSexes Eligible for Study \n\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers \n\nYes\n\nStudy Plan\n----------\n\nThis section provides details of the study plan, including how the study is designed and what the study is measuring.\n\nExpand all / Collapse all\n\n How is the study designed? \n\nDesign Details\n\n**Primary Purpose  :**Health Services Research\n\n**Allocation  :**Randomized\n\n**Interventional Model  :**Parallel Assignment\n\n**Masking  :**None (Open Label)\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Participant Group/Arm | Active Comparator: Group I (usual care) Patients receive financial literacy training consisting of watching online educational videos over 2-8 minutes. Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-60 minutes about education, employment, finances (assets, debt), insurance, and quality of life (financial worry) and have credit reports assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.

Patients also meet with CENTS counselor and PAF case manager over approximately 1 hour every month for 6 months (with each group). Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-60 minutes about education, employment, finances (assets, debt), insurance, and quality of life (financial worry) and have credit reports assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. If participating, spouse/partner caregivers will receive the same intervention, and will complete questionnaires and have credit reports assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. | Intervention/Treatment | Other: Educational Intervention * Watch online educational videos * Other Names: * Education for Intervention * Intervention by Education * Intervention through Education * Intervention, Educational Behavioral: Patient Navigation * Meet with CENTS counselor and PAF case manager * Other Names: * Patient Navigator Program Other: Quality-of-Life Assessment * Ancillary studies * Other Names: * Quality of Life Assessment Other: Questionnaire Administration * Complete questionnaires |\n\n What is the study measuring? \n\n Primary Outcome Measures \n\n| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient financial hardship | Defined as one or more of the following: from the patient's credit report within 12 months: any new loans (bank or home equity); exhausting lines of credit by reaching limits on credit cards and home equity loans; credit or other payment delinquencies; becoming subject to a lien, judgment, or other collection process; personal bankruptcy filings. Will conduct a multivariable logistic regression (outcome = patient financial hardship; independent variable = intervention versus [vs.] control), adjusting for demographic, clinical, financial and practice characteristics. | Up to 12 months |\n\n Secondary Outcome Measures \n\n| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Quality of life: patient | As measured by composite European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L). The proportion of patients in each arm who experience improved, unchanged, or worsened EQ-5D scores from baseline to 3, 6 (and 12) months will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Mean score changes will be compared using two group t tests. A multivariate linear regression model, with worsening score as the dependent variable and study arm as the independent variable will be performed. | Up to 12 months |\n| Financial worry | Will be measured by the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity-Patient Reported Outcome Measure (COST-Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT] version 2; Financial Toxicity Scale ranges from 0-44, with higher scores indicating greater financial well-being). Mean scores (and standard deviation [SD]) at 3, 6 and 12 months will be compared between intervention and usual care patients using two sample t tests. | Up to 12 months |\n| Treatment adherence: Number of patients | Number of patients by study arm self-reporting that they did or did not skip medication doses or refuse/decline recommended therapy due to cost concerns. | Up to 12 months |\n| Treatment adherence: Proportion of patients | Proportion of patients by study arm self-reporting that they did or did not skip medication doses or refuse/decline recommended therapy due to cost concerns. | Up to 12 months |\n| Emergency department/hospital use | Will be abstracted from patients' medical records by site staff. Investigators will categorize visits as anticipated (for chemotherapy or planned procedures) versus unanticipated (complication or treatment side-effect). The cumulative incidence of emergency department and unanticipated hospital use will be calculated by arm to account for death as a competing risk and compared using Cox regression, adjusting for covariates. | Up to 12 months |\n\nOther Outcome Measures \n\n| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Spouse/partner caregiver financial hardship | Defined as one or more of the following: from the spouse/partner caregiver's credit report within 12 months: any new loans (bank or home equity); exhausting lines of credit by reaching limits on credit cards and home equity loans; credit or other payment delinquencies; becoming subject to a lien, judgment, or other collection process; personal bankruptcy filings. Will conduct a multivariable logistic regression (outcome = spouse/partner financial hardship; independent variable = intervention versus [vs.] control), adjusting for demographic, clinical, financial and practice characteristics. | Up to 12 months |\n| Spouse/partner caregiver burden | As measured by the social well-being (Social Concerns, range:0-90, higher scores better) subscale of the City of Hope Quality of Life Family questionnaire. Mean score changes will be compared using two group t tests. A multivariate linear regression model, with worsening score as the dependent variable and study arm as the independent variable will be performed. | Up to 12 months |\n| Quality of life: spouse/partner caregiver | As measured by City of Hope Quality of Life Family subscale scores (Physical Well Being (0-50), Psychological Well Being (0-110); higher scores better). We will determine the proportion of spouse/partner caregivers in each arm who experience improved, unchanged, or worsened Quality of Life Family scores (composite scores for physical, psychological, and social well-being subscales) from baseline to 3, 6 (and 12) months and compare using Fisher's exact test. Mean score changes will be compared using two group t tests. A multivariate linear regression model, with worsening score as the dependent variable and study arm as the independent variable will be performed. | Up to 12 months |\n| Community/clinic assistance | Control arm dyads will be surveyed about availability (or lack), access to, and use of financial assistance via their treating clinic or community-based resources. | Up to 12 months |\n| Qualitative assessment of the intervention | Qualitative Assessment of the Intervention: Intervention arm dyads will be surveyed about availability and use of financial assistance and navigation services with Consumer Education and Training Services (CENTS) and/or Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF). CENTS and PAF will document all interactions with the intervention dyads and specific details about all counseling, assistance, and interventions provided for the dyad over the 6-month intervention period using Medidata Rave. | Up to 12 months |\n\nCollaborators and Investigators\n-------------------------------\n\nThis is where you will find people and organizations involved with this study. \n\nSponsor \n\nSWOG Cancer Research Network\n\nCollaborators \n\n*   National Cancer Institute (NCI) \n\nInvestigators \n\n*   Principal Investigator:Veena Shankaran,SWOG Cancer Research Network \n\nStudy Record Dates\n------------------\n\n These dates track the progress of study record and summary results submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov.

Building on prior research characterizing these efforts (Part 1), this scoping review (Part 2) evaluates the effectiveness of these initiatives, with a focus on SDOH data integration, EHR utilization, and the broader scope of hospital efforts in addressing individual- and system-level determinants of health. Using an integrated conceptual framework combining the DeVoe & Cottrell framework for operational assessment and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) 5A framework for systemic evaluation, this study provides a multidimensional assessment of hospital-based SDOH interventions.\n\n### Methods\n\nGuided by PRISMA-ScR criteria, this review analyzed 41 U.S.-based studies published between 2018 and 2023, identified through three academic databases. Eligible studies examined hospital initiatives addressing SDOH with measurable outcomes. Analyses assessed SDOH data collection, integration into care practices, EHR use, and overall initiative effectiveness.\n\n### Results\n\nMost studies (66%) were randomized controlled trials in urban settings (68%), targeting patients with chronic or mental health conditions (39%) or high-risk healthcare users (20%). Nearly half of initiatives (49%) addressed multiple SDOH domains, focusing on Social & Community Context, Economic Stability, and Neighborhood & Built Environment. Only 24% of initiatives utilized EHRs for SDOH data collection. EHR-based initiatives demonstrated significantly higher adherence to evidence-based practices, including use of community resource guides for referrals (90% vs. 45%, *p*\u2009=\u20090.013). Across all outcome measures, 79% demonstrated improvement, with no instances of worsening outcomes. However, 85% of initiatives lacked community-level SDOH data integration, and few employed upstream, universal strategies. Process, clinical, and social outcomes were unevenly prioritized, with only 10% of studies addressing all three outcome types.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWhile these initiatives reflect progress in integrating SDOH into care workflows and improving whole-person care at the individual level, progress toward health equity remains insufficient. Persistent gaps in EHR use, community-level data integration, and upstream strategies hinder systemic impact, potentially perpetuating disparities. Strengthening SDOH-EHR integration, fostering community partnerships, and supporting policy advocacy are critical to bridging individual and community needs. Future research should emphasize long-term, sustainable, and community-level impacts of hospital-led SDOH interventions.\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-025-12494-2.\n\n**Keywords:** Social determinants of health, Hospitals and health systems, Health-related social needs, Electronic health records, Whole person care, Population health, Health equity, Quintuple aim\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn recent years, hospitals and health systems in the United States (U.S.) have placed greater emphasis on addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) [[1](#CR1)\u2013[3](#CR3)]. In 2000, nearly 900,000 deaths in the U.S. were linked to social determinants such as racial segregation, inadequate social support, low education, income inequality, and poverty [[4](#CR4)]. SDOH are widely recognized to play a more significant role than healthcare in shaping population health outcomes [[5](#CR5)]. For example, people in low-income neighborhoods often face inadequate housing and limited access to healthy food, contributing to higher rates of preventable illnesses and premature death [[4](#CR4)\u2013[6](#CR6)].\n\nHealthy People 2030, a U.S. federal initiative aimed at addressing national public health priorities, provides a framework for organizing SDOH into five key domains: (1) economic stability, (2) education access and quality, (3) social and community context, (4) healthcare access and quality, and (5) the neighborhood and built environment [[7](#CR7)]. An unequal distribution of SDOH at the community level is the root cause of health-related social needs (HRSNs) at the individual level [[8](#CR8)]. HRSNs refer to the specific, immediate social needs of individuals, such as access to healthy food, affordable housing, or reliable transportation. In this sense, HRSNs are the downstream, individual impacts of systemic inequities in SDOH distribution, highlighting how community-level conditions directly shape individual health challenges [[8](#CR8), [9](#CR9)].\n\nThe U.S. is home to 6,120 hospitals, with 5,129 (84%) of them being community hospitals. Among these, 2,987 (49%) are nonprofit community hospitals. Additionally, 3,510 (57%) community hospitals are part of a health system, including both multihospital and diversified single-hospital systems [[10](#CR10)]. Nonprofit community hospitals, as tax-exempt organizations, are legally required to support the well-being of their communities and possess significant financial resources to address SDOH [[11](#CR11)]. They have the potential to implement both \u201cdownstream\u201d and \u201cupstream\u201d strategies. Downstream efforts might involve screening patients for HRSNs, like housing insecurity, and connecting them to community services [[1](#CR1), [3](#CR3), [12](#CR12)]. Upstream approaches could include investing in local housing infrastructure, expanding affordable housing, and advocating for policy changes at the state and federal levels to address housing stability on a broader scale [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)]. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, hospitals and health systems in the U.S. made minimal investments in addressing SDOH [[1](#CR1), [12](#CR12), [15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. The ACA marked a turning point by shifting provider payments from fee-for-service to value-based care and requiring nonprofit hospitals to conduct Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) and develop implementation strategies every three years. Value-based care has pushed providers to look beyond treating specific diseases, encouraging them to address unmet social needs, improve outcomes, and provide better value to patients and payers. Additionally, CHNAs have strengthened collaboration between hospitals, health departments, and community organizations [[13](#CR13), [15](#CR15)].\n\nDespite progress, concerns remain about the adequacy and distribution of hospital initiatives to address SDOH [[12](#CR12)]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rural, critical access, and safety-net hospitals screened for social needs at similar rates as non-safety-net hospitals but implemented fewer interventions, leaving vulnerable populations underserved [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)]. In the post-pandemic era, there has been unprecedented federal focus on reducing health disparities [[19](#CR19), [20](#CR20)]. For the first time, the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) and other federal agencies have adopted a multi-sector approach to tackle structural barriers to health equity [[20](#CR20)]. As the largest healthcare payer, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will play a pivotal role in improving quality, equity, and outcomes in the coming decade [[21](#CR21)].\n\n### Study purpose and significance\n\nThis paper aims to assess the *impact* of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the U.S. through a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature. Notably, it serves as a follow-up (Part 2) to a previous article by the authors, which outlined the *characteristics* of these initiatives [[22](#CR22)]. The earlier paper (Part 1) detailed key aspects of hospital efforts, including the types of SDOH addressed, conditions targeted, services provided, and the emphasis on downstream HRSNs versus upstream SDOH. It also examined universal versus targeted approaches [[23](#CR23)], internal capacity versus community partnerships, the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to manage SDOH data, and challenges hospitals face in addressing SDOH [[24](#CR24), [25](#CR25)].\n\nThe earlier paper (Part 1) focused on \u201cwhat\u201d hospitals and health systems are doing to address SDOH, offering insight into the scope and distribution of these initiatives in the U.S. It found that academic health centers led more initiatives than safety-net facilities, with most efforts being research-based, including clinical trials. Only one-third used the EHR to collect SDOH data, and most were downstream efforts targeting individual needs rather than upstream community-level solutions like housing investments. Initiatives often relied on internal capacity rather than community partnerships. The study highlighted that the focus on clinical trials targeting high-risk populations, combined with limited EHR use, may hinder the ability to address community needs holistically and limit the scalability of these efforts in safety-net hospitals [[22](#CR22)]. These findings underscored the need for policy incentives to more effectively integrate SDOH data into EHR systems and foster stronger community partnerships to ensure broader, sustainable impact. While Part 1 explored \u201cwhat\u201d hospitals/health systems are doing to address SDOH in the U.S, it did not assess \u201chow effectively\u201d they are doing it. This paper (Part 2) seeks to address the latter question by examining the impact of these initiatives.\n\n### Research questions\n\nThe objective of this review is to evaluate the impact of existing hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the United States. The research questions are as follows:\n\n1. How successful have hospitals and health systems been in collecting and organizing patient-reported and community-level SDOH data?\n   1. *Have standardized SDOH data collection tools been utilized*?\n   2. *Have hospitals effectively leveraged EHR technology for the collection and organization of SDOH data*?\n\n* 2.\n\n  How effectively have hospitals and health systems integrated SDOH data into care practices, and to what extent have they used EHR technology for this integration?\n  1. *Have SDOH data been incorporated into clinical workflows and referral processes*?\n  2. *Have EHR systems been used to automate actions for addressing SDOH*?\n* 3.\n\n  Have hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH shown a positive impact on targeted outcome measures?\n  1. *What types of outcomes have been targeted (process, clinical, or social outcomes)*?\n  2. *What has been the measurable impact of services on these outcomes*?\n* 4.\n\n  How do initiatives that used EHR technology to collect and organize SDOH data compare with those that did not?\n\nAlthough not explicitly stated as a research question, this paper will examine the attributes of studies included in the review, including study design, targeted populations, rural versus urban settings, and sources of funding or sponsorship. By presenting this evidence, the paper will provide critical insights to contextualize the current state of research on hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the US.\n\nImportantly, while the overall effectiveness of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH is not framed as a distinct research question, this topic will be a focal point in the discussion section. By synthesizing the findings from Parts 1 and 2 of this study, the discussion will explore whether and how hospital and health system efforts to address SDOH have contributed to improving outcomes and advancing health equity.\n\n### Rationale for a scoping review\n\nScoping reviews are well-suited for addressing broad questions, such as exploring the available literature on a specific topic [[26](#CR26)]. To date, no comprehensive review has examined the impact of hospital and health system-led initiatives addressing SDOH in the U.S. This review fills that gap, with its questions designed to capture the full scope of knowledge in this area.\n\n## Conceptual framework\n\nThe earlier article (Part 1) [[22](#CR22)] was the first systematic scoping review of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the U.S. It made two key contributions: (1) creating a framework to identify the types of SDOH that hospitals and health systems should address and (2) developing a comprehensive model to characterize these efforts. Part 1 integrated the Healthy People SDOH framework [[7](#CR7)] with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) SDOH listing [[27](#CR27)] to identify SDOH types and inform the search for hospital initiatives. Additionally, Part 1 provided an extensive characterization of these initiatives based on the results of the review, drawing upon an existing conceptual framework adapted by Pourat et al. (2022) [[28](#CR28)] to assess SDOH efforts undertaken by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Part 1 used this framework to understand hospitals\u2019 use of EHRs for collecting SDOH data.\n\nBuilding on Part 1, this study (Part 2) advances the focus from describing hospital initiatives, to systematically evaluating their effectiveness in addressing SDOH. The conceptual framework for this review integrates existing frameworks, namely the DeVoe and Cottrell framework [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)] adapted by Pourat et al. [[28](#CR28)], while introducing the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) 5A framework [[31](#CR31)] to enhance the study\u2019s ability to address research questions. The integration of these frameworks ensures a robust and multidimensional approach to evaluating the overall effectiveness of hospital and health system initiatives.\n\n### Existing conceptual frameworks\n\nAs described in Part 1, Pourat et al. (2022) [[28](#CR28)] adapted a conceptual framework developed by DeVoe et al. (2018) and expanded by Cottrell et al. (2019) [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)] to conduct a systematic review of efforts by FQHCs to address SDOH. This framework outlines four key steps for integrating SDOH data into care delivery: (1) collecting and organizing patient- and community-level SDOH data, (2) integrating this data into care workflows, (3) creating EHR-based automated support for action on SDOH data, and (4) evaluating the impact of integrating SDOH into care.\n\nAlthough originally designed for primary care, the DeVoe and Cottrell framework provides evidence-based practices for integrating SDOH data across all care settings [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)]. Pourat et al. adapted it to evaluate FQHCs, which also deliver acute and chronic care, and recommended its broader application to other providers and health plans [[28](#CR28)]. The framework is particularly relevant for hospitals and health systems in the current context, as CMS strengthens Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REL) and SDOH data collection efforts as part of the HHS health equity initiative [[20](#CR20), [21](#CR21)]. This focus on REL and SDOH data underscores the importance of integrating clinical and social care in addressing health disparities, making the DeVoe and Cottrell framework a vital tool for assessing hospital-led efforts [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)].\n\n### Integrating the NAM 5A framework with the existing DeVoe & Cottrell framework\n\nBuilding on the previously introduced DeVoe and Cottrell framework, this study incorporates the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) 5A framework to provide a comprehensive evaluation of hospital and health system initiatives addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). As illustrated in Fig. [1](#Fig1), these frameworks offer distinct but complementary perspectives, strengthening the study\u2019s analytic depth by assessing both operational integration and system-level scope and influence.\n\nThe DeVoe and Cottrell framework, previously discussed as the foundation for evaluating how hospitals integrate SDOH data into care delivery, focuses on four core operational steps: SDOH data collection, workflow integration, referral and resource linkage, and outcome tracking. This framework provides a structured approach to assessing how hospitals embed SDOH data into clinical workflows and leverage it to support patient care coordination.\n\nIn contrast, the NAM 5A framework categorizes the scope and system-level influence of hospital-led SDOH initiatives into two levels. Individual-focused activities, including Awareness, Adjustment, and Assistance, address patient-level social needs, while community-focused activities, such as Alignment and Advocacy, aim to create systemic and structural change. The integration of these frameworks ensures a dual-level assessment that captures both the operational execution of hospital-led SDOH initiatives and their broader systemic influence on health equity.\n\nFigure [1](#Fig1) provides a visual representation of this integrated conceptual approach, highlighting how these frameworks work in tandem to assess the effectiveness, scope, and operational execution of SDOH interventions in hospital settings. The NAM framework is leveraged in this study to serve three key purposes. First, it provides a structured approach to evaluating how hospital initiatives address both immediate patient needs and upstream systemic determinants of health. Second, it complements the DeVoe and Cottrell framework by offering a system-level perspective, examining whether initiatives focus on downstream or upstream efforts and their broader impact on health equity. Third, integrating these frameworks strengthens the analytic approach, ensuring that the study not only assesses the effectiveness of data integration but also evaluates the strategic scope and potential impact of hospital-led initiatives.\n\nBy leveraging both frameworks, this study offers a more comprehensive understanding of how hospitals contribute to addressing SDOH, balancing individual patient care with broader community-level strategies. This integration enhances the ability to evaluate not only how hospitals operationally implement SDOH initiatives but also the extent to which they align with systemic goals for advancing health equity.\n\n### New contributions\n\nAs a follow-up to the first comprehensive review of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the U.S., this review directly contributes to the literature by conducting a systematic impact assessment of these efforts. It evaluates whether hospitals have systematically collected SDOH data, integrated it into clinical workflows, assessed the impact of these initiatives, and demonstrated improvements in health outcomes. The review also sheds light on the types of SDOH beyond REL that hospitals have addressed and the extent to which SDOH data collection has been standardized.\n\nAdditionally, this review compares the impact of initiatives that utilized EHR systems to collect and organize SDOH data with those that did not, offering deeper insights into the role of EHRs in driving effective outcomes. It also provides a holistic assessment of initiative effectiveness by integrating insights from Part 1 regarding the adequacy and distribution of initiatives with impact assessments from this review. This holistic perspective is enhanced using the NAM framework. These contributions aim to inform policy and future research while promoting best practices for addressing SDOH within hospitals and health systems.\n\n### Specific enhancements to the DeVoe & Cottrell framework\n\nIn addition to integrating the NAM 5A and DeVoe & Cottrell frameworks, this review introduces specific enhancements to the DeVoe & Cottrell framework to strengthen its applicability in evaluating hospital-led SDOH initiatives. One key enhancement is the expansion of outcome measures to include social outcomes, such as housing stability and access to nutritious food, alongside clinical and process measures, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment. Another refinement is the incorporation of impact direction, evaluating whether initiatives result in improved, unchanged, or worsened outcomes to provide a more nuanced understanding of effectiveness. Additionally, this review captures funding sources and sponsorship for each initiative, an element not previously included, to offer insights into how these efforts are resourced and sustained. These enhancements, which are reflected in Appendix [1](#MOESM1), ensure a more robust framework for assessing the operational integration of SDOH data into healthcare delivery while informing strategies for scaling and sustaining effective interventions.\n\n### Leveraging existing evidence-based practices for evaluating initiatives\n\nThe DeVoe and Cottrell framework (Appendix [1](#MOESM1)) identifies evidence-based practices for integrating SDOH data into care delivery, both within and outside the EHR [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)]. These practices, developed through research evidence, have been validated as effective strategies for integrating SDOH into clinical workflows from an operational perspective and provide a structured foundation for evaluation [[28](#CR28)\u2013[30](#CR30)]. This study leverages these evidence-based practices to assess hospital and health system efforts in three key areas: the collection and organization of SDOH data, the integration of SDOH data into care, and the use of EHR technology to facilitate this integration, and the impact of services on outcomes. These areas align directly with the study\u2019s research questions, ensuring that the framework is used systematically to evaluate hospitals\u2019 adherence to best practices in addressing SDOH.\n\nWhile no nationally standardized set of evidence-based practices for integrating SDOH into care and EHRs currently exists, the DeVoe and Cottrell framework serves as a robust guide for this study\u2019s clinical and operational assessments [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)]. Complementing this framework, the broader NAM framework provides a systemic lens to evaluate individual-focused activities and community-level strategies [[31](#CR31)]. This dual perspective ensures that the study evaluates both clinical/operational practices and broader systemic contributions, fostering actionable insights to improve outcomes and advance health equity.\n\n### Comparison between EHR-utilizing initiatives and non-EHR initiatives\n\nThe earlier article noted that only a small proportion of initiatives used EHR systems to collect and organize SDOH data. This review compares the impact of initiatives that used EHR technology with those that did not, offering deeper insights for practice, policy, and research.\n\n### Holistic assessment of initiative effectiveness\n\nFinally, and importantly, this review integrates findings from Part 1 regarding the characteristics of hospital-led SDOH initiatives with impact assessments from this review. This integration enables a more comprehensive understanding of the overall effectiveness of hospital and health system efforts to address SDOH in the U.S. By leveraging the NAM framework\u2019s dual categorization of individual- and community-focused activities, this study provides a nuanced analysis of hospital initiatives and their alignment with systemic health equity goals. The NAM framework directly supports the research questions, particularly those examining the integration of SDOH data into workflows (RQ#2) and the discussion on overall effectiveness of initiatives. By integrating the NAM 5A framework alongside the DeVoe and Cottrell frameworks, this study offers a comprehensive and multidimensional perspective, advancing the understanding of how healthcare systems can effectively address SDOH and promote health equity.\n\n## Methodology\n\nBoth Parts 1 and 2 of this review were planned from the start, with distinct objectives. Part 1 focused on identifying \u201cwhat\u201d hospitals and health systems in the U.S. are doing to address SDOH, while this review evaluates \u201chow effectively\u201d these initiatives are being implemented. There is no overlap in research questions between the two reviews. As outlined in Part 1, the scoping review followed PRISMA-ScR criteria [[32](#CR32)] and searched three academic databases for eligible articles from 01.01.2018 to 06.30.2023. The review protocol, based on Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines [[33](#CR33)], was not registered but is included in Appendix [2](#MOESM2), with the PRISMA-ScR checklist in Appendix [3](#MOESM3).\n\n### Information sources\n\nThe information sources for both Parts 1 and 2 included three academic databases: PubMed, ABI/Inform, and Academic Search Premier. These databases were selected to ensure comprehensive coverage across medical, public health, and social sciences domains, aligning with the interdisciplinary nature of SDOH research and our focus on peer-reviewed literature. These databases were searched for relevant articles published between 01.01.2018 and 06.30.2023. The search was conducted in September 2023.\n\n### Search strategy\n\nAs outlined in Part 1, three sets of search terms were used to identify articles on hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH in the U.S [[22](#CR22)]. The first set targeted individual SDOH factors. Part 1 integrated the five Healthy People SDOH domains [[7](#CR7)] with the IHI\u2019s list of ten SDOH areas for hospitals [[27](#CR27)], including (i) health coverage, (ii) food insecurity, (iii) housing instability, (iv) unmet immigrant needs, (v) unmet correctional health needs, (vi) climate and decarbonization related challenges, (vii) voting right violations, (viii) lack of educational support, (ix) lack of early childhood support, and (x) lack of social support among the elderly.\n\nPart 1 includes a figure summarizing this framework, which guided the search for SDOH-related articles. The second set of search terms focused on the care setting, using keywords such as \u201chospital,\u201d \u201chealth system,\u201d \u201chealth center,\u201d and \u201cmedical center\u201d to reflect the wide variety of healthcare providers, including 5,000\u2009+\u2009community hospitals and 220\u2009+\u2009academic health/medical centers [[10](#CR10)] in the U.S. The third set of terms incorporated National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to capture the context of social determinants of health. These three sets of terms were combined with Boolean operators to form the final search algorithm. The complete search strategy used in PubMed is detailed in Appendix [4](#MOESM4).\n\n### Eligibility criteria\n\nPart 1 of the review employed broader eligibility criteria, and included research articles (e.g., randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies), as well as case reports and review articles, some of which lacked outcome measures. It also included studies focused on predicting social risk and understanding disparities, such as predictive models for food insecurity [[22](#CR22)]. However, since Part 2 aims to assess the impact of hospital and health system interventions on SDOH, it is restricted to research articles that describe hospital-led initiatives designed to address SDOH and improve outcomes. Studies predicting social risks without implementing interventions were excluded.\n\nTo be included in Part 2, articles had to meet the following criteria: published between 01.01.2018 and 06.30.2023, in English, in peer-reviewed journals, and based in the U.S. At least one author had to be affiliated with a U.S.-based institution, and the article had to describe a hospital or health system-led initiative focused on addressing SDOH within the U.S. The articles also needed to be available in full text from open-access or publishing sources. Eligible articles were required to be research studies using outcome measures (e.g., process, clinical, or social outcomes) to evaluate the impact of SDOH initiatives. Excluded articles included study protocols, editorials, opinion papers, discussion papers, review articles, and case reports. Finally, articles had to meet the critical appraisal criteria set by the JBI [[33](#CR33)] and/or the Mixed-Method Assessment Tool (MMAT) [[34](#CR34)] as applicable, after satisfying all other eligibility requirements.\n\n### Process for selecting sources of evidence\n\nAs outlined in Part 1, the eligibility criteria were applied across three stages of article selection: (1) during the academic database search, (2) during article screening, and (3) during full-text review. In the final stage, (4) articles meeting the critical appraisal criteria were included in the review. After the database search, all identified articles were uploaded into Zotero 5.0 to remove duplicates. Titles and abstracts were then screened for potential inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. Full texts of the remaining articles were reviewed, and those meeting the criteria underwent a critical appraisal using JBI checklists for clinical trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies, and the MMAT for mixed-method studies. Articles passing critical appraisal were included in the final scoping review. At each stage, two independent reviewers resolved conflicts through discussion, consulting a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached.\n\n### Process for charting data items for individual sources of evidence\n\nAll included articles were thoroughly reviewed to extract data across corresponding to the first three research questions (RQ#1\u2013 RQ#3). The fourth research question (RQ#4) was addressed through a quantitative comparison between initiatives that used EHRs and those that did not. All data collected on individual sources of evidence is available in Appendix [5](#MOESM5) (Charts 1\u20134), and the raw dataset is provided in Appendix [6](#MOESM6).\n\n### Process for synthesizing results\n\nData collected from the articles were summarized using counts, aggregates, and proportions to analyze and interpret findings in relation to the review questions. Bivariate analyses (chi-square tests) were conducted to compare proportions between EHR-utilizing and non-EHR initiatives, providing insights into potential associations between EHR use and the effectiveness of these interventions. Additionally, results from Parts 1 and 2 were integrated to offer a qualitative assessment of the overall effectiveness of hospital and health system efforts in addressing SDOH. This process enabled a comprehensive synthesis of evidence on the impact and effectiveness of these initiatives in the United States.\n\n## Results\n\n### Selection of sources of evidence\n\nAs outlined in Part 1 [[22](#CR22)], a total of *n*\u2009=\u20093,027 studies were initially identified through database searches, ready for duplicate removal and screening. The initial search, which applied only a date restriction, retrieved *n*\u2009=\u200921,246 records across the three databases: PubMed (*n*\u2009=\u20098,772), ABI/Inform (*n*\u2009=\u200910,436), and Academic Search Premier (*n*\u2009=\u20092,038). After applying additional exclusion criteria, *n*\u2009=\u200918,219 records were removed. From the remaining *n*\u2009=\u20093,027 articles, *n*\u2009=\u2009268 duplicates were excluded. Following title and abstract screening, *n*\u2009=\u20092,381 articles were excluded due to not being in English (*n*\u2009=\u20092), being an ineligible article type (*n*\u2009=\u200984), not being based in the U.S. (*n*\u2009=\u20091,605), or being outside the study\u2019s scope (*n*\u2009=\u2009690). The full text of the remaining *n*\u2009=\u2009378 articles was reviewed, and further exclusions were made for ineligible article type (*n*\u2009=\u200976), not being U.S.-based (*n*\u2009=\u200920), and falling outside the scope (*n*\u2009=\u2009234). After critical appraisal, *n*\u2009=\u20097 more articles were excluded, leaving *n*\u2009=\u200941 for final inclusion in this review [[35](#CR35)\u2013[75](#CR75)]. The search results are visually detailed in the PRISMA chart in Fig. [2](#Fig2).\n\n### Characteristics of sources of evidence\n\nThe attributes of all 41 included studies (individual sources of evidence) are detailed in Appendix [5](#MOESM5), Chart 1.\n\n### Results of individual sources of evidence\n\nAppendix [5](#MOESM5), Charts 2, 3, and 4 present the results related to RQ#1, RQ#2, and RQ#3, respectively, for all 41 studies.\n\n### Synthesis of results\n\n#### Attributes of studies included in the review\n\nTable [1](#Tab1) presents the characteristics of the study sample (*n*\u2009=\u200941). The majority were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (*n*\u2009=\u200927, 66%), followed by observational studies (*n*\u2009=\u20098, 19%), which included observational-quantitative (17%) and observational-mixed-method (2%) designs. The sample also included analytical cross-sectional studies (*n*\u2009=\u20094, 10%) and quasi-experimental studies (*n*\u2009=\u20092, 5%). Target populations varied, with most studies focusing on patients with chronic or mental health conditions (*n*\u2009=\u200916, 39%) and high-risk healthcare users (*n*\u2009=\u20098, 20%). Other specialized groups included pediatric patients (*n*\u2009=\u20096, 15%) and pregnant women (*n*\u2009=\u20092, 5%). Most studies were conducted in urban settings (*n*\u2009=\u200928, 68%) or across multiple regions (*n*\u2009=\u20099, 22%), with only 4 studies (10%) based in rural areas. Regarding funding, more than half of the studies (*n*\u2009=\u200924, 58%) were supported by federal agencies or non-federal research foundations. Federal agencies included the NIH (22%), CMS (5%), HRSA (2%), and the Veterans Health Administration (7%), while non-federal sources (22%) included the RWJF and PCORI. Multiple funding sources supported 10 studies (24%).\n\n##### Table 1.\n\nStudy characteristics\n\n| # | Data Element | Frequency | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1** | **Study design (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Randomized Controlled Trial | 27 | 65.85% |\n| Quasi-experimental Study | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Analytical Cross-sectional Study | 4 | 9.76% |\n| Observational Quantitative Study | 7 | 17.07% |\n| Observational Mixed-Method Study | 1 | 2.44% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **2** | **Targeted population (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| General Adult Patients | 9 | 21.95% |\n| Pediatric Patients | 6 | 14.63% |\n| Pregnant Women | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Patients with Chronic Disease or Mental Health Conditions | 16 | 39.02% |\n| High-risk for Healthcare Utilization | 8 | 19.51% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **3** | **Setting (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Rural | 4 | 9.76% |\n| Urban | 28 | 68.30% |\n| Regional or State-level or Multiple Regions | 9 | 21.95% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **4** | **Funding source of study (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| National Institutes for Health (NIH) | 9 | 21.95% |\n| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Other Federal or Non-federal Funding Source | 13 | 31.71% |\n| Multiple Funding Sources | 10 | 24.30% |\n| Private Funding Source | 1 | 2.44% |\n| No External Funding | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Not Described | 3 | 7.32% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/Tab1/)\n\n#### RQ#1: collection and organization of patient-reported and community-level SDOH data\n\nTable [2](#Tab2) summarizes efforts to collect and organize SDOH data. Only 12% of initiatives (*n*\u2009=\u20095) assessed care team needs through focus groups (*n*\u2009=\u20092), expert panels (*n*\u2009=\u20091), or partnerships (*n*\u2009=\u20091), while 88% (*n*\u2009=\u200936) did not provide this information. Feedback on patient perspectives was gathered by 5% (*n*\u2009=\u20092), and 7% (*n*\u2009=\u20093) assessed provider perspectives, with full support shown, while 93% (*n*\u2009=\u200938) did not report this information. Most initiatives (*n*\u2009=\u200928, 68%) used standardized tools to collect SDOH data, with *n*\u2009=\u20093 (7%) using standardized tools that have been promoted by federal agencies like PRAPARE, WE CARE, or the AHC Screening Tool. Other standardized tools included the Well Rx questionnaire [[76](#CR76)], US Department of Agriculture (USDA) food security survey [[77](#CR77)], Hunger Vital Sign [[78](#CR78)], PROMIS [[79](#CR79)], PHQ-9 [[80](#CR80)], and others related to food insecurity, housing stability, and social support. A few initiatives (*n*\u2009=\u20098, 20%) used self-developed tools.\n\n##### Table 2.\n\nAssessment of collection and organization of patient-reported and community-level SDOH data\n\n| # | Data Element | Frequency | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1** | **Gathered data based on needs of care teams (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 5 | 12.20% |\n| Not Described | 36 | 87.80% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **2** | **Gathered data on providers perspectives on integration of SDOH into workflows (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Not Described | 38 | 92.68% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **3** | **Gathered data on patient feelings on collecting SDOH data and including them in EHR (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Not described | 39 | 95.12% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **4** | **Used standardized data collection methods (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes (Used standardized tool) | 28 | 68.30% |\n| Yes (Used Self-developed tool) | 8 | 19.51% |\n| Not Described | 5 | 12.19% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **5** | **Type of specific SDOH indicators collected (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Economic Stability | 4 | 9.76% |\n| Education Access and Quality | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Neighborhood and Built Environment | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Healthcare Access and Quality | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Social and Community Context | 7 | 17.07% |\n| Multiple | 20 | 48.78% |\n| Not Specified | 3 | 7.32% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **6** | **Leveraged EHR technology for collecting patient reported SDOH (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 10 | 24.39% |\n| Not Described | 31 | 75.61% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **7** | **Frequency of SDOH data collection (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| One-time collection | 17 | 41.46% |\n| At initial and follow-up visits (multiple timepoints) | 13 | 31.71% |\n| Not Described | 11 | 26.83% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **8** | **Types of community-level SDOH data (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Census Data | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Other | 5 | 12.20% |\n| Not Described | 35 | 85.36% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/Tab2/)\n\nOnly 24% (*n*\u2009=\u200910) of initiatives used EHR technology to collect SDOH data [[36](#CR36), [37](#CR37), [41](#CR41), [42](#CR42), [61](#CR61), [63](#CR63), [64](#CR64), [66](#CR66), [70](#CR70), [72](#CR72)], while the majority (*n*\u2009=\u200931, 76%) did not describe using the EHR, instead, many of these non-EHR initiatives reported using independent technology like the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) to collect SDOH data. Only 15% (*n*\u2009=\u20096) of all initiatives collected community-level SDOH data, although none stored it in EHRs. Nearly half (*n*\u2009=\u200920, 49%) collected multiple types of SDOH, focusing on Social and Community Context, Economic Stability, and Neighborhood and Built Environment, with less focus on Education Access and Quality. Most studies collected SDOH data once at baseline (41%), with 32% collecting at multiple points, and 27% not reporting frequency.\n\n#### RQ#2: integration of SDOH data into care practices and use of EHR technology\n\nTable [3](#Tab3) details efforts to integrate SDOH data into care workflows and utilize EHR technology. Consistent with findings reported under RQ#1, only 24% of studies (*n*\u2009=\u200910) used EHRs for storing and reporting patient-reported SDOH data. Overall, reports or summaries of patient-level SDOH data were generated by 46% of studies, shared with the care team in 34% of studies and discussed with patients in 27% of studies. Many studies (56%) used community resource lists or guides to aid referrals, with 22% providing these guides to patients and another 24% facilitating referrals through other means, including appointments with community health workers. Only one study (2%) integrated a community resource database directly into the EHR [[66](#CR66)].\n\n##### Table 3.\n\nAssessment of integration of SDOH data into care practices and use of EHR technology\n\n| Data Element | Frequency | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***Integration of SDOH data into care practices*** |\n| **1** | **Created reports or summarized patient-level SDOH data (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 19 | 46.34% |\n| Not Described | 22 | 53.66% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **2** | **Patient SDOH data was shared with the care team (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 14 | 34.15% |\n| Not Described | 27 | 65.85% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **3** | **Care team discussed SDOH results with patients (***n*\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 11 | 26.83% |\n| Not Described | 30 | 73.17% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **4** | **Used list or guide of community resources to facilitate referrals (***n*\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes (Database embedded in EHR) | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Yes (Resources provided by provider or staff) | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Yes (Generalized resource guide provided to patients) | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Yes (Personalized resource guide provided to patients) | 6 | 14.63% |\n| Yes (Support network) | 2 | 4.87% |\n| Yes (Other) | 10 | 24.40% |\n| Not Described | 18 | 43.90% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **5** | **Had referral protocols (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 20 | 48.78% |\n| Not Described | 21 | 51.22% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **6** | **Patient referral practices used (****n**\u2009***=\u200941)*** |\n| Yes (Gave patients a referral) | 12 | 29.27% |\n| Yes (Helped patients make an appointment) | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Yes (Warm Handoff) | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Yes (Other) | 3 | 7.32% |\n| Not clear | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Not Described | 19 | 46.34% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **7** | **Tracked referrals (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes (Through follow-up calls) | 5 | 12.20% |\n| Yes (Other) | 8 | 19.51% |\n| No (Didn\u2019t track referrals) | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Not Described | 26 | 63.41% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **8** | **Had protocols on use of community-level SDOH data in referrals and patient management (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 0 | 0% |\n| Not described | 41 | 100% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| ***Use of EHR technology in the integration*** |\n| **9** | **Stored and presented patient-level SDOH data in the EHR (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 10 | 24.40% |\n| Not Described | 31 | 75.60% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **10** | **Stored and presented community-level SDOH data in the EHR (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 0 | 0% |\n| Not Described | 41 | 100% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **11** | **Described staffing models and training resources in EHR (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Not Described | 40 | 97.56% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **12** | **EHR-based tool included automated triggers or alerts (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Not Described | 40 | 97.56% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **13** | **Had referral tracking tools in EHR (*****n***\u2009**=\u200941)** |\n| Yes | 3 | 7.32% |\n| No (Didn\u2019t track referrals) | 1 | 2.44% |\n| Not Described | 37 | 90.24% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n| **14** | **Community resources lists were integrated into the EHR (*****n***\u2009*=\u200941)* |\n| Yes | 2 | 4.88% |\n| Not Described | 39 | 95.12% |\n| **Total** | **41** | **100%** |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/Tab3/)\n\nMany studies (49%) incorporated patient referral practices. Specific initiatives offered patients a referral (*n*\u2009=\u200912, 29%), helped schedule social service appointments (*n*\u2009=\u20093, 7%), or provided warm hand-offs to service providers (*n*\u2009=\u20092, 5%). About one-third (*n*\u2009=\u200913, 32%) tracked referrals to confirm service receipt, using methods like follow-up calls (*n*\u2009=\u20095) or other means such as patient self-reports or follow-ups with community health workers (*n*\u2009=\u20098). Only one study (2%) detailed staffing models and training resources within the EHR, including streamlined workflows and decision-making tools to overcome complexity and time barriers [[36](#CR36)]. One other study (2%) incorporated EHR-based tools like automated alerts to notify team members about hospitalizations of children from high-risk neighborhoods [[66](#CR66)]. Additionally, three studies (7%) integrated referral tracking tools into the EHR [[36](#CR36), [41](#CR41), [63](#CR63)].\n\nApplying the NAM framework reveals a limited implementation of both individual- and community-level activities [[31](#CR31)]. For individual-level efforts, such as \u201cAwareness\u201d (identifying social risks) and \u201cAdjustment\u201d (modifying care to accommodate barriers), the studies demonstrated some progress, with 68% using standardized tools to collect SDOH data and 32% conducting follow-up to track referrals. However, \u201cAssistance\u201d activities, such as systematically connecting patients to resources, remain underdeveloped, with only 5% of studies facilitating warm hand-offs and just 2% integrating resource databases directly into EHRs. Community-level efforts, represented by \u201cAlignment\u201d (organizing community assets) and \u201cAdvocacy\u201d (supporting systemic changes), were notably underrepresented. Only 15% of initiatives collected community-level SDOH data, and none integrated it into EHRs. Moreover, while 56% of studies used community resource lists, the lack of integration into the EHR and clinical workflows highlights missed opportunities to leverage these tools for broader systemic alignment.\n\n#### RQ#3: demonstration of impact of services on targeted outcome measures\n\nFigure [3](#Fig3) provides a three-part comprehensive summary of the impact of hospital and health system initiatives on targeted outcome measures. The top tier highlights the distribution of studies assessing process, clinical, and social outcomes, using an innovative Venn diagram to show overlaps where studies assessed multiple types of outcomes. For instance, 10% of studies (*n*\u2009=\u20094) evaluated all three types of outcome measures, while 41% (*n*\u2009=\u200917) assessed a combination of two, and nearly half (49%, *n*\u2009=\u200920) targeted a single outcome type. Additionally, the stratified bar graph in the second tier illustrates the direction of effects for process, clinical, and social outcomes, categorizing them as improved, showing no change, or mixed results. Examples of interventions are also provided to illustrate these findings, offering context and evidence on the impact of specific interventions in practice.\n\nAcross the 41 studies included in this review, a total of 66 instances of measures (process, clinical, or social) were assessed. Of these, improvement was recorded in 52 instances (79%) of all measures. In 9 instances (14%), no change was recorded, and mixed results were reported in 5 instances (7%). These aggregated findings underscore the overall positive direction of most interventions while also indicating some no change or mixed results in outcomes, reflecting the potential need for further refinement to achieve consistent and sustainable outcomes.\n\nThe evaluation of process outcomes revealed improvements in 87% of cases (*n*\u2009=\u200920 of 23 instances), with no instances of worsening outcomes. For example, in a nurse-led hospital-to-community care intervention for people living with HIV, viral suppression rates significantly increased in the intervention group [[44](#CR44)]. Other examples of process outcomes included increased referrals and improved medication adherence. Notably, 10% of process outcomes (*n*\u2009=\u20092) showed no change, while one instance (5%) showed mixed results, such as goal-setting adherence improving but lagging in SDOH referrals [[49](#CR49)].\n\nClinical outcomes were assessed either alone or in combination with other types of outcomes in 31 instances, with 68% showing improvement (*n*\u2009=\u200921). For example, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving community health workers demonstrated a significant reduction in 30-day hospital readmissions for patients discharged to short-term rehabilitation facilities [[37](#CR37)]. However, in 23% of instances (*n*\u2009=\u20097), clinical outcomes showed no change, and in 10% (*n*\u2009=\u20093), mixed results were reported. Examples of clinical outcomes included bio-confirmed smoking cessation, reductions in HbA1c levels, and psychological health improvements.\n\nSocial outcomes were assessed in 12 instances, with 83% (*n*\u2009=\u200910) showing improvement. For example, a collaborative initiative between local health departments and nonprofit hospitals fostered healthy behaviors and strengthened social capital within communities, enhancing relationships between key stakeholders [[58](#CR58)]. In one instance, no change was observed (8%), and another (8%) reported mixed results, such as varying impacts on patient-provider relationships over time. Social outcomes measured included food security, access to utilities, and reductions in child maltreatment.\n\nAmong the four studies that evaluated all three types of outcome measures\u2014process, clinical, and social\u2014three studies (75%) demonstrated significant improvements across all domains. For example, one RCT examined the effects of self-management support for diabetes in community health centers, showing improvements in self-management behaviors (process outcomes), mental health (clinical outcomes), and food security and access to utilities (social outcomes) [[38](#CR38)]. Another study on enabling services in health centers found that care coordination, health education, and free medications (process outcomes) were linked to increased routine checkups (clinical outcomes) and improved primary care access (social outcomes) [[59](#CR59)].\n\nBeyond these measures, fewer studies assessed additional impacts, such as patient and provider experiences (*n*\u2009=\u20096, 15%), the costs and benefits of collecting SDOH data (*n*\u2009=\u20093, 7%), or the use of SDOH data for policy advocacy and risk adjustment (*n*\u2009=\u200911, 27%). For instance, one study conducted a social-return-on-investment analysis of a health system\u2019s affordable housing program, using SDOH data to identify policy gaps and inform advocacy efforts [[60](#CR60)].\n\n#### RQ#4: impact differences between initiatives that used EHR technology vs. those that did not\n\nAs mentioned earlier, less than a quarter of the initiatives (*n*\u2009=\u200910, 24%) used EHRs to collect and organize SDOH data. Table [4](#Tab4) compares EHR-utilizing initiatives with non-EHR initiatives on adherence to key best practices. The results reveal that initiatives utilizing EHR technology demonstrated significantly higher adherence to evidence-based practices for effectively integrating SDOH data into care delivery, outperforming non-EHR initiatives in this critical area.\n\n##### Table 4.\n\nBivariate analysis comparing EHR-utilizing initiatives with non-EHR initiatives\n\n| Leveraged EHR technologies for collecting self-reported SDOH | *p*-value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yes *n* (%) | Not described *n* (%) |\n| **ADHERENCE TO EVIDENCE-BASED IMPLEMENTATION PRACTICES** |\n| **Gathered data based on needs of care teams** |\n| Yes | 4 (40.00%) | 1 (3.23%) | 0.002\\* |\n| Not described | 6 (60.00%) | 30 (96.77%) |\n| **Used standardized data collection methods** |\n| Yes (Used standardized tool) | 8 (80.00%) | 20 (64.52%) | 0.173 |\n| Yes (Used self-developed tool) | 0 (0%) | 8 (25.81%) |\n| Not described | 2 (20.00%) | 3 (9.68%) |\n| **Used list or guide of community resources to facilitate referrals** |\n| Yes | 9 (90.00%) | 14 (45.16%) | 0.013\\* |\n| Not described | 1 (10.00%) | 17 (54.84%) |\n| **Had referral protocols** |\n| Yes | 7 (70.00%) | 8 (25.81%) | 0.012\\* |\n| Not described | 3 (30.00%) | 23 (74.19%) |\n| **Patient referral practices used** |\n| Yes | 8 (80.00%) | 12 (38.71%) | 0.023\\* |\n| Not described/ Not clear | 2 (20.00%) | 19 (61.29%) |\n| **Tracked referrals** |\n| Yes | 6 (60.00%) | 7 (22.58%) | 0.027\\* |\n| No/Not described | 4 (40.00%) | 24 (77.42%) |\n| **PERFORMANCE ON OUTCOME MEASURES** |\n| **Assessed process outcomes** |\n| Yes | 5 (50.00%) | 18 (58.06%) | 0.655 |\n| Not described | 5 (50.00%) | 13 (41.94%) |\n| **Results on process outcomes (** ***n*** **=\u200923)** |\n| Improved | 5 (100%) | 15 (83.33%) | 0.328 |\n| Not improved\\*\\* | 0 (0%) | 3 (16.67%) |\n| **Assessed clinical/health outcomes** |\n| Yes | 8 (80.00%) | 23 (74.19%) | 0.710 |\n| Not described | 2 (20.00%) | 8 (25.81%) |\n| **Results on clinical/health outcomes (** ***n*** *=\u200931)* |\n| Improved | 7 (87.50%) | 14 (60.87%) | 0.165 |\n| Not improved\\*\\* | 1 (12.50%) | 9 (39.13%) |\n| **Assessed social outcomes** |\n| Yes | 1 (10.00%) | 11 (35.48%) | 0.124 |\n| No | 9 (90.00%) | 20 (64.52%) |\n| **Impact on social outcomes (** ***n*** **=\u200912)** |\n| Improved | 1 (100%) | 9 (81.82%) | 0.640 |\n| Not improved\\*\\* | 0 (0%) | 2 (18.18%) |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/Tab4/)\n\n\\* Indicates statistical significance at the 0.05 level (*p*\u2009<\u20090.05)\n\n\\*\\*The \u201cnot improved\u201d category under impact on outcome measures represents an aggregate of \u201cno change\u201d, \u201cmixed results\u201d and \u201cworsened\u201d results summarized in Table [4](#Tab4)\n\nTo begin with, a significantly higher proportion of EHR-utilizing initiatives (40%) reported gathering data based on the needs of care teams prior to implementation, compared to non-EHR initiatives (3%) (*p*\u2009=\u20090.002). EHR-utilizing initiatives were also more likely to use standardized tools for collecting SDOH data (80%) compared to non-EHR initiatives (65%). Conversely, none of the EHR initiatives used self-developed tools, while 26% of non-EHR initiatives relied on such tools.\n\nAdditionally, there were significant differences in referral practices. 90% of EHR initiatives used community resource lists to facilitate referrals, compared to 45% of non-EHR initiatives (*p*\u2009=\u20090.012). Similarly, 70% of EHR initiatives had referral protocols, compared to 26% of non-EHR initiatives (*p*\u2009=\u20090.013), and 80% of EHR initiatives used patient referral practices, compared to 39% among non-EHR initiatives (*p*\u2009=\u20090.023). Referral tracking was also more common in EHR initiatives (60%) compared to non-EHR initiatives (23%) (*p*\u2009=\u20090.027). No significant differences were noted between EHR initiatives and non-EHR initiatives on the types of outcomes assessed, and the results related to outcome measures.\n\nIt is noteworthy that among the 41 total studies reviewed, only two studies (5%) explicitly integrated community resource lists into EHRs. This highlights a significant gap in leveraging EHR systems for community resource alignment and referral facilitation. However, as reported above, among the 10 EHR-utilizing initiatives, 9 studies (90%) used lists or guides of community resources to facilitate referrals, even if most were not directly integrated into EHR systems. Figure [3](#Fig3) includes examples of the use of these lists or guides for community resource referral, such as personal resource guides tailored to demographics, referrals to wraparound services co-located at outpatient clinics, and use of community referral networks (CFN) for patients screening positive for HRSNs.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Summary of results\n\nThe study sample (*n*\u2009=\u200941) predominantly consisted of randomized controlled trials (66%) and observational studies (19%), focusing mainly on chronic or mental health conditions (39%) and high-risk healthcare users (20%). Most studies were urban based (68%), with limited representation from rural areas (10%). Funding came primarily from federal agencies (58%) and non-federal sources like RWJF and PCORI (22%).\n\nEfforts to collect and organize SDOH data showed that only 12% of studies assessed care team needs, 7% gathered provider perspectives, and only 24% used EHRs for data collection. However, 68% of initiatives used standardized tools. Nearly half the initiatives (49%) collected multiple types of patient-reported SDOH data, focusing on Social and Community Context, Economic Stability, and Neighborhood and Built Environment, with less focus on Education Access and Quality. Only 15% collected community-level SDOH data. When integrating SDOH data into care workflows, nearly half (49%) had referral protocols, and 56% used community resource lists for referrals.\n\nEHR-based initiatives demonstrated better adherence to evidence-based practices, with 40% gathering care team input (compared to 3% in non-EHR initiatives), 80% using patient referral practices (vs. 39% in non-EHR), and 60% using referral tracking (vs. 23% in non-EHR). This suggests that EHR integration has potential to strengthen the continuum of care and support both patient-level and community-level interventions.\n\nOutcomes were assessed across process, clinical, and social measures. Of the 66 outcome measures used across all studies, 79% showed improvement, with no worsening outcomes reported. Among studies targeting a single outcome measure (*n*\u2009=\u200920), clinical outcomes were targeted by 55% of studies, process outcomes by 35%, and social outcomes by 10%. Studies evaluating all three outcome types (10%) demonstrated improvements in 75% of cases, including better food security, health education, and social support.\n\n### Overall effectiveness of hospital and health system initiatives to address SDOH\n\nWhile most initiatives in this study (79%) demonstrated improvements across process, clinical, and social outcomes, these results do not tell the whole story. In the absence of SDOH-EHR integration, many of these initiatives may be one-off efforts with limited potential for replicability or sustainability. Moreover, the improvements observed are often driven by downstream, targeted interventions that address immediate needs but fail to tackle broader systemic inequities. Without a balanced intervention design that integrates upstream and universal approaches [[23](#CR23), [24](#CR24)], such initiatives risk perpetuating disparities rather than reducing them. This underscores the need to move beyond simply evaluating outcomes and focus on the structural and operational gaps that hinder the long-term effectiveness of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH.\n\n#### Outcomes mask persistent gaps\n\nThe integration of findings from Part 1 and Part 2 reveals three critical gaps that persist despite observed outcome improvements: (1) a predominant focus on downstream interventions over upstream approaches, (2) an over-reliance on targeted efforts at the expense of universal strategies, and (3) a lack of systematic integration of SDOH data into EHRs [[22](#CR22), [25](#CR25)]. Downstream interventions, while addressing immediate HRSNs, fail to tackle upstream determinants such as housing, education, and economic stability that drive long-term health outcomes. Similarly, the predominance of targeted approaches often leaves broader community needs unaddressed, further reinforcing disparities. For example, only 15% of initiatives in this study collected community-level SDOH data, and none stored it in EHRs, limiting their ability to align clinical efforts with broader community resources. This narrow focus undermines the potential for sustainable and equitable health outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing these gaps through a more integrated and comprehensive approach.\n\n#### Leveraging the NAM framework to illuminate gaps\n\nThe NAM framework provides a valuable lens to further illuminate gaps in hospital-led SDOH initiatives. The framework emphasizes the importance of balancing individual-focused activities (Awareness, Adjustment, Assistance) with community-level efforts (Alignment, Advocacy). Findings from this study indicate that most hospital initiatives align with individual-focused activities but neglect community-level strategies, such as advocacy for systemic changes. For instance, while 90% of EHR-utilizing initiatives used community resource lists for referrals, few integrated these lists into broader advocacy efforts or aligned their practices with community resources. This imbalance limits the potential of these initiatives to address upstream determinants and achieve sustainable health equity.\n\nA key missing dimension in many initiatives is the application of \u201ccold spotting,\u201d a strategy focused on identifying underserved areas or populations lacking adequate resources to address SDOH [[81](#CR81)]. By integrating cold spotting into EHR-supported analytics, hospitals can proactively identify resource gaps and prioritize interventions for marginalized communities. This strategy aligns with the NAM framework\u2019s emphasis on alignment and advocacy, ensuring that interventions extend beyond individual needs to address structural inequities. For example, cold spotting could guide hospitals in targeting areas with high food insecurity or inadequate housing, ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed.\n\nAlthough cold spotting has been proposed as a strategy to link healthcare with public health efforts, its implementation faces challenges. Effective use of cold spotting requires robust data systems, integration of diverse datasets, and strong collaboration between healthcare institutions and community organizations. Additionally, operational and financial constraints may hinder hospitals\u2019 ability to reallocate resources based on identified cold spots. Overcoming these barriers requires investment in data infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and policy initiatives that support targeted interventions in underserved communities [[81](#CR81)].\n\nWhile this review did not identify any hospital initiatives explicitly using cold spotting, its integration into SDOH interventions represents an important opportunity to enhance health equity. By leveraging EHR analytics and geospatial data, hospitals can refine their approach to addressing community-level disparities, complementing existing patient-centered strategies with broader systemic reforms.\n\n#### The critical role of SDOH-EHR integration\n\nIntegrating SDOH data into EHR systems is foundational for enhancing the design, implementation, and evaluation of hospital-led SDOH initiatives. EHRs enable hospitals to link individual-level data with broader population health analytics, supporting a balanced intervention design that addresses both immediate needs and systemic inequities [[22](#CR22), [25](#CR25), [82](#CR82)]. However, this study found significant gaps in SDOH-EHR integration, with only 24% of initiatives using EHRs to collect and organize SDOH data. Key deficiencies in integration were observed across several areas, limiting the full potential of SDOH-informed care delivery.\n\nOne major gap was community resource integration, with only 5% of initiatives embedding community resource lists within EHR systems to facilitate referrals. The absence of this functionality restricts hospitals\u2019 ability to align patient care with broader community-level resources, thereby reducing the effectiveness of interventions designed to address systemic SDOH inequities. Additionally, standardized data collection tools were inconsistently utilized; while 68% of initiatives employed standardized tools, 36% of non-EHR initiatives either relied on self-developed tools or did not specify their methodology. This lack of standardization undermines data interoperability and scalability, making it more difficult to share and integrate SDOH data across healthcare and social service sectors. Furthermore, referral tracking was inconsistent across initiatives. Although 60% of EHR-utilizing initiatives implemented referral tracking mechanisms, 40% did not, creating gaps in ensuring continuity of care and evaluating intervention impact. Without robust tracking mechanisms, it becomes challenging to determine whether referred patients successfully accessed necessary social services or whether interventions had the intended effect.\n\nDespite these gaps, EHR-utilizing initiatives demonstrated significantly higher adherence to evidence-based practices compared to non-EHR initiatives. For example, 90% of EHR initiatives used community resource lists for referrals, compared to 45% of non-EHR initiatives, and 70% of EHR initiatives had formal referral protocols, compared to 26% of non-EHR initiatives. These capabilities provide EHR-utilizing initiatives with an advantage in delivering whole-person care by streamlining service coordination and strengthening social care linkages. However, the persistent deficiencies in community resource integration, standardization, and referral tracking highlight the need for more systematic SDOH-EHR integration. Strengthening these areas is essential for hospitals to not only improve care coordination but also advance health equity by ensuring that interventions extend beyond individual patient needs to address broader systemic determinants.\n\n#### Whole-person care vs. health equity\n\nWhole-person care focuses on the individual level, addressing the full spectrum of factors influencing health, including clinical, social, and environmental determinants [[22](#CR22), [23](#CR23)]. EHR-utilizing initiatives are particularly well-suited for whole-person care, as they integrate SDOH data into workflows, enabling providers to address patients\u2019 immediate social needs more effectively [[25](#CR25)]. For example, referral tracking was significantly more common among EHR-utilizing initiatives (60%) compared to non-EHR initiatives (23%), reflecting the meaningful integration of SDOH data into patient-centered care processes. Examples from this study include initiatives that demonstrated significant improvements in process, clinical, and social outcomes, such as increased use of enabling services, improved chronic disease management, and enhanced food security. Overall, these efforts reflect meaningful progress in addressing whole-person care at an individual level.\n\nHowever, from a health equity perspective, the findings reveal critical shortcomings. Health equity requires addressing systemic and structural factors contributing to disparities in health outcomes. The lack of community-level data integration, underutilization of policy advocacy, and insufficient use of standardized tools limit the ability of EHR-utilizing initiatives to advance equity. Additionally, the reliance on targeted approaches risks reinforcing disparities, particularly if underserved populations remain overlooked [[22](#CR22)]. Incorporating cold spotting strategies focused on identifying and addressing gaps in service delivery could help hospitals proactively address inequities and ensure resource allocation aligns with community needs [[81](#CR81)].\n\n#### Why hospitals and health systems must address SDOH\n\nSome have argued that addressing SDOH represents a \u201cbridge too far\u201d for hospitals and health systems, given their primary focus on clinical care and resource constraints [[83](#CR83)]. This perspective suggests that tackling social determinants may overextend the role of healthcare institutions, diverting attention from their core mission. However, such a viewpoint overlooks the intrinsic link between SDOH and health outcomes, as well as the critical role of hospitals in achieving systemic goals like the Quintuple Aim [[84](#CR84)]., which includes improving population health, enhancing patient experience, reducing costs, improving provider well-being, and advancing health equity. By addressing SDOH, hospitals not only fulfill a moral imperative but also position themselves to improve population health, reduce costs, and advance health equity. The NAM framework [[31](#CR31)] and CMS health equity initiative [[21](#CR21)] emphasize the need for integrating SDOH into healthcare delivery as part of a Learning Health System (LHS) approach [[85](#CR85)]. This perspective aligns with the growing recognition that addressing SDOH is essential for sustainable healthcare transformation.\n\nNonprofit community hospitals, in particular, have a unique obligation to address SDOH due to their community benefit requirements and substantial financial resources. While direct investment in social services is one approach, hospitals can also leverage strategic starting points to set the stage for upstream transitions without perpetuating disparities [[22](#CR22)]. These include:\n\n* *Policy Advocacy*: Using aggregated SDOH data to advocate for systemic changes, such as housing policy reforms or broadband expansion, ensures interventions address root causes [[60](#CR60)].\n* *Community Partnerships*: Collaborating with local organizations enhances the reach and impact of hospital initiatives, aligning efforts with existing community resources [[22](#CR22), [51](#CR51)].\n* *Enabling Services*: Providing services such as transportation assistance, health education, or care coordination addresses immediate barriers to care while laying the groundwork for systemic reforms [[59](#CR59)].\n* *Direct Investment*: While resource-intensive, direct investments in areas like affordable housing or food security can yield transformative impacts on community health [[13](#CR13)].\n\nHospitals must recognize that targeted interventions, if not carefully designed, can move further away from health equity by disproportionately benefiting certain groups while leaving others behind. Adopting a broader health equity perspective enables hospitals to preempt this risk and ensure their efforts contribute to sustainable and equitable health outcomes. By leveraging strategic starting points, hospitals can address immediate needs while laying the foundation for transitioning from downstream to upstream approaches.\n\nThe findings of this study highlight both the progress and limitations of hospital and health system initiatives addressing SDOH. While significant strides have been made in improving individual outcomes through whole-person care, persistent gaps in SDOH-EHR integration, universal approaches, and upstream reforms limit their overall effectiveness in advancing health equity. By prioritizing systematic EHR integration, leveraging strategic starting points, and adopting a balanced intervention design, hospitals can enhance the sustainability and equity of their SDOH initiatives. These insights set the stage for the next section, which will explore implications for policy, practice, and future research.\n\n### Implications for policy\n\nIn 2022, CMS launched a health equity initiative requiring hospitals and health systems to expand data collection beyond REL to include five SDOH domains: food insecurity, housing instability, transportation insecurity, interpersonal safety, and utilities [[86](#CR86)]. To facilitate SDOH data integration into electronic health records (EHRs), CMS has promoted the use of ICD-10-CM Z codes [[87](#CR87)] and tools like PRAPARE to standardize data collection [[88](#CR88), [89](#CR89)].\n\nThis review emphasizes evidence-based practices for collecting and integrating SDOH data, such as gathering team-specific data, using standardized tools, sharing patient SDOH data with care teams, and tracking the outcomes of referrals. Less than a quarter of the initiatives reviewed used EHRs for SDOH data, but those that did showed significantly higher adherence to these best practices. Given the critical role of SDOH-EHR integration in addressing social determinants both downstream (e.g., screening patients for housing insecurity) and upstream (e.g., advocating for affordable housing policies), it is essential for policymakers to incentivize and support the integration of SDOH data into EHRs. This could involve financial incentives for EHR upgrades, promoting standardized tools like PRAPARE, and fostering cross-sector partnerships to streamline care coordination and referrals.\n\nHospitals have faced challenges such as organizational and implementation barriers in addressing SDOH. Some have responded by launching initiatives like unconscious bias training for staff, engaging patients in data collection, and educating internal stakeholders on the importance of SDOH data to alleviate concerns about potential impacts on reimbursement [[90](#CR90), [91](#CR91)]. Policymakers, particularly CMS, could play a key role in supporting such initiatives by offering research grants to explore best practices for overcoming these barriers and practice grants to assist hospitals in upgrading EHR systems. CMS could also develop tax breaks or other financial incentives for hospitals that successfully integrate SDOH data into care workflows. In addition, policymakers could consider reforming the community benefit program to better incentivize hospitals to address SDOH effectively. Updating requirements to emphasize measurable social outcomes, such as improved housing stability or reduced food insecurity, would ensure that tax-exempt resources are used for impactful SDOH-related programs targeted to addressing systemic inequities.\n\nIn addition to supporting hospitals directly, policymakers could incentivize health plans to facilitate SDOH-based care coordination by offering bonuses or funding for digital platforms that integrate SDOH data. Health plans and hospitals could engage with community partners to create referral networks for addressing needs like food and housing insecurity. Community Resource Referral Platforms (CRRPs) like NowPow or Aunt Bertha [[92](#CR92), [93](#CR93)] allow hospitals to link patients to local resources while tracking referral outcomes, ensuring continuity of care across health and social service sectors.\n\nPolicymakers could also support hospitals in addressing upstream SDOH through policy advocacy and community partnerships. For example, they could collaborate with hospitals to expand access to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits [[94](#CR94)] or advocate for zoning reforms to promote affordable housing [[13](#CR13), [60](#CR60)]. By focusing on policy advocacy, partnerships, financial incentives, and technology, this multifaceted approach would drive more effective and equitable integration of SDOH into healthcare delivery, with potential to address both immediate health-related social needs and broader structural determinants of health.\n\n### Implications for practice\n\nIntegrating the findings from Parts 1 and 2 of the review provides a comprehensive framework for learning healthcare systems to effectively address both downstream and upstream social determinants of health (SDOH) and promote health equity. The learning healthcare systems (LHS) approach is particularly well-suited for this role due to its dynamic, data-driven approach. It continuously learns and adapts through data collection, evidence generation, and real-time feedback [[85](#CR85), [95](#CR95), [96](#CR96)]. Such adaptability would allow LHS to identify disparities and social risks across populations and inform targeted interventions at both the individual (downstream) and community (upstream) levels. Moreover, LHS can foster collaboration across sectors\u2014such as healthcare, social services, and policy advocacy\u2014making it a powerful tool to tackle SDOH challenges and create a more equitable healthcare system [[95](#CR95)]. Based on the findings of this study, outlined below are five key principles LHS could use to address SDOH.\n\n#### Invest in understanding community-level determinants of health\n\nLearning healthcare systems must not only focus on social risks among high-risk patient groups but also consider the broader determinants of health at the community level [[66](#CR66)]. Relying solely on data from targeted high-risk groups can create gaps; for example, a focus on housing insecurity in one demographic could overlook other populations affected by housing instability. Hospitals can partner with local public health departments, conduct community surveys, or use geospatial mapping to gather data on community-level risks. Investing in predictive models and data systems that track community-wide needs enables hospitals to design comprehensive, proactive interventions that address emerging social risks before they become entrenched health disparities.\n\n#### Clarify the scope: downstream HRSNs vs. upstream SDOH\n\nLHS must define whether its focus will be on downstream efforts (addressing individual health-related social needs) or upstream initiatives (tackling structural issues like housing policies). While downstream interventions may be resource-dependent, it is crucial to ensure that even these efforts are equity-driven. For example, offering food assistance should consider the unique challenges of those living in food deserts, ensuring interventions do not inadvertently increase inequities [[64](#CR64), [69](#CR69), [94](#CR94)]. Equity should be the guiding principle in all interventions, whether downstream or upstream, to avoid reinforcing existing disparities.\n\n#### Leverage EHR technology to collect and organize SDOH data\n\nIntegrating SDOH data into EHRs is essential for creating seamless workflows that address social needs in real-time. LHS should invest in implementing evidence-based practices for SDOH-EHR integration [[22](#CR22), [25](#CR25), [82](#CR82)]. This includes engaging providers in the process, accurately collecting patient-reported data, and facilitating care coordination through referral systems [[28](#CR28)\u2013[30](#CR30)]. Challenges such as unconscious bias or staff unfamiliarity with SDOH data collection can hinder this process, so hospitals should provide training to reduce bias and enhance patient engagement. By effectively integrating SDOH data into clinical workflows, hospitals can efficiently connect patients with the necessary resources for holistic, patient-centered care.\n\n#### Implement both universal and targeted SDOH initiatives\n\nOnce EHR integration is established, hospitals can focus on universal initiatives such as community-wide screenings and referrals to better understand and address social needs [[23](#CR23), [24](#CR24), [36](#CR36), [64](#CR64)]. These screenings should be combined with targeted initiatives that use community health data to address the needs of specific populations. For example, universal SDOH screening can identify social risks across the community, while targeted initiatives might focus on housing support for vulnerable populations. In other words, initiatives could address both immediate individual needs (downstream) and broader structural challenges (upstream), such as housing policy reforms [[13](#CR13), [60](#CR60), [94](#CR94)].\n\n#### Transform downstream into upstream initiatives\n\nTo transition downstream interventions into sustainable upstream solutions, hospitals can leverage strategic starting points that facilitate long-term systemic change while addressing immediate social needs. One critical avenue is policy advocacy, where hospitals can play an influential role in pushing for legislative and regulatory changes that address structural determinants of health, such as affordable housing policies or expanded transportation access [[60](#CR60)]. By engaging in advocacy efforts, hospitals can help shape policies that have a lasting impact on social conditions affecting health outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, community partnerships serve as a powerful mechanism for expanding the reach and sustainability of hospital-led SDOH initiatives. Collaborating with local organizations, such as food banks or housing coalitions, enables hospitals to scale their interventions beyond individual patient care and embed them within broader, community-driven efforts [[22](#CR22), [51](#CR51)]. These partnerships can enhance resource alignment and improve care coordination, ensuring that hospitals are not working in isolation but rather integrating their efforts within established community infrastructures.\n\nAnother effective strategy involves enabling services, such as providing transportation assistance or digital literacy training, which help bridge gaps in care access. These services address immediate barriers that patients face while also highlighting the need for broader infrastructure improvements, ultimately contributing to long-term public health advancements [[59](#CR59)]. In some cases, hospitals may choose to engage in direct investment in social programs to create sustainable, long-term impact. Investments in initiatives like affordable housing projects can shift hospitals from providing temporary solutions\u2014such as housing vouchers\u2014to fostering stable housing options that contribute to long-term community health improvements [[13](#CR13), [60](#CR60)]. By directing resources toward structural interventions, hospitals can help address root causes of health inequities rather than merely mitigating their effects.\n\nBy incorporating these strategic approaches, learning healthcare systems can continuously refine and expand their capacity to address both downstream and upstream SDOH. A multifaceted strategy that blends policy advocacy, community collaboration, enabling services, and targeted investments will enhance the role of healthcare institutions in advancing health equity. This holistic transformation fosters collaboration, innovation, and data-driven decision-making, positioning hospitals as key drivers of systemic change in the pursuit of improved health outcomes.\n\n### Implications for future research\n\nBased on the discussion on overall effectiveness and the analysis of sponsors, several recommendations emerge for future research:1) *Expand beyond targeted \u201chot spotting*\u201d: Federal sponsors like NIH, CMS, and private foundations such as RWJF and PCORI should fund research that moves beyond targeting small, high-risk populations. Future initiatives should prioritize universal SDOH screening and address broader, community-wide needs, with a focus on upstream interventions that impact entire communities. 2) *Incentivize SDOH-EHR integration*: Sponsors should emphasize SDOH-EHR integration in future grants. This includes incentivizing hospitals to adopt or upgrade EHR systems to capture patient-reported and community-level SDOH data [[22](#CR22), [82](#CR82)]. Research should also explore predictive models leveraging SDOH data for clinical and population health strategies. 3) *Support community-level social needs*: Funders should encourage hospital initiatives that address structural SDOH through CHNAs and collaborations with local organizations [[51](#CR51), [58](#CR58)], prioritizing underserved communities. 4) *Address implementation challenges*: Research should focus on overcoming barriers to SDOH-EHR integration, staff engagement, and referral processes. Funders could incentivize training programs and infrastructure development for referral tracking and care coordination across sectors. 5) *Promote strategic starting points for upstream efforts*: Sponsors should emphasize policy advocacy, community partnerships, enabling services, and direct investments in social programs. These efforts would shift hospital initiatives from short-term interventions to long-term solutions addressing root causes of health disparities.\n\n### Strengths and limitations\n\nThe scoping review adhered to evidence-based JBI criteria and PRISMA guidelines, with a clear rationale for choosing a scoping review to align with the broader research objectives. The review employed an integrated framework incorporating Healthy People SDOH domains and industry-recommended types to guide a thorough search of peer-reviewed literature.\n\nAmong limitations, one was the exclusion of gray literature, such as industry reports and unpublished studies, potentially omitting valuable insights from non-peer-reviewed initiatives. The review\u2019s timeline was also limited, excluding earlier initiatives from the ACA era, and it was restricted to English-language studies, which reduces the applicability of findings to non-English-speaking populations and international settings. Additionally, hospitals may have used strategies outside the conceptual framework, limiting the ability to capture diverse approaches. Lastly, new studies may have emerged post-review that could offer updated insights.\n\nDespite these limitations, the review provides key strengths, filling a gap in the literature by offering critical insights into the effectiveness of U.S. hospital initiatives addressing SDOH, an area underexplored in previous research. The study employed a rigorous methodology using an integrated SDOH framework, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of hospital efforts [[22](#CR22), [32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)]. By focusing on impact and outcomes, it delivers practical insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers. Finally, this review makes significant contributions to the field of health equity by assessing how hospitals address both individual health-related social needs and broader community-level social determinants of health, offering a more holistic picture of the effectiveness of U.S. hospitals in addressing SDOH.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe findings of this study highlight progress in hospital and health system initiatives to address SDOH but also reveal significant gaps. While many hospitals focus on health-related social needs (HRSNs) for high-risk populations, most efforts remain centered on downstream, patient-level interventions, with limited attention to upstream, community-wide solutions. The inconsistent use of electronic health records (EHRs) for integrating SDOH data and coordinating care underscores the need for improvement. To achieve whole-person care and health equity, hospitals must adopt universal strategies that address social risks across entire communities. Integrating SDOH data into EHRs is crucial for scaling these efforts, allowing for better care coordination and data-driven decisions. Hospitals should also focus on building community partnerships, enabling services, and engaging in policy advocacy to tackle structural determinants of health. Policymakers, particularly CMS, can support these efforts by expanding funding for universal screening and EHR upgrades, as well as encouraging cross-sector collaboration and policy advocacy efforts. Future research and funding should prioritize SDOH-EHR integration, community-level interventions, and the development of long-term solutions that address the root causes of health disparities. By working collaboratively, hospitals, policymakers, and sponsors can move beyond fragmented, short-term interventions and create lasting, equitable improvements in population and community health.\n\n## Supplementary Information\n\n[Supplementary Material 1.](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM1_ESM.doc) (27.4KB, doc)\n\n[Supplementary Material 2.](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM2_ESM.doc) (23.8KB, doc)\n\n[Supplementary Material 3.](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM3_ESM.doc) (57KB, doc)\n\n[Supplementary Material 4.](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM4_ESM.doc) (15.3KB, doc)\n\n[Supplementary Material 5.](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM5_ESM.doc) (89.5KB, doc)\n\n[Supplementary Material 6](/articles/instance/11884203/bin/12913_2025_12494_MOESM6_ESM.xls) (78.9KB, xls)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank the University of New Haven for awarding a Summer Research Grant to support this project.

Here, we published a call for manuscripts detailing the study of innovations in the field of implementation of integrated care in the USA. We present 13 articles, all peer reviewed and all targeting some aspect of integrated care implementation. These articles include medical and community-based settings, as well as interventions that effectively engage peers, family members, and other social systems to support and extend care. The behavioral health conditions of interest include but were not limited to those that carry the greatest population disease burdens: depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders. Examples of cross-cutting issues of high interest include research focused on provider and system barriers to integrated care implementation, interventions to improve the use of innovative treatments, disparities in access to care and quality of treatment, the intersection of behavioral health disorders and complex chronic conditions as it affects regimen adherence, health services organization and quality of care, policy effects, innovative methods using health information and mHealth technologies, and personalized/precision medicine. This introduction briefly summarizes some of the relevant topics and background literature. We close with an eye toward future research activities that will continue to advance the field and offer directions to stimulate new research questions in the area.\n\n**Keywords:** Integrated care, Collaborative care, State of science\n\n* * *\n\nImplications.\n-------------\n\n**Practice:** Implementation of collaborative or integrated care processes is feasible for primary care clinics and other settings but requires support and training and monitoring for quality improvement. The complexities of implementation can mostly be addressed with these resources.\n\n**Policy:** Continuing to fund the more specific aspects of integrated care through federal and other means is important for the sustainability of these efforts.\n\n**Research:** Research into other settings for integrated care, barriers, and supports for active implementation and methods of sustaining initial change are all important areas of research for future studies.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)CALL FOR PAPERS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe produced a call for a special issue of _Translational Behavioral Medicine_ that focused on the methods and programs by which we translate evidence generated by those early randomized trials into practice for integrated care. For this special issue, the focus is original, high-impact research and systematic reviews providing insights into innovative methods for effectively integrating mental health services into nonspecialty care settings that achieve significant population health outcomes, both international and domestic. This includes implementations in medical and community-based settings, as well as implementations that effectively engage peers, family members, and other social systems to support and extend care. The behavioral health conditions of interest included but were not limited to those that carry the greatest population disease burdens: depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Examples of cross-cutting issues of high interest include provider and system barriers to integrated care implementation, interventions to improve the use of innovative treatments, disparities in access to care and quality of treatment, the intersection of behavioral health disorders and complex chronic conditions affecting regimen adherence, health services organization and quality of care, policy effects, innovative methods using health information and mHealth technologies, and personalized/precision medicine. With an eye toward population impact, we wanted scholarship in this area to guide and inform mental health, general medical, and community-level policy as it relates to the integration of mental health services into diverse health systems and community agencies.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)INTEGRATED CARE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntegrated care for mental health disorders is an evidence-based treatment strategy found in primary care and in other nonmental health settings that targets the identification and treatment of psychological problems in the context of ongoing care and activities. Integrated care for depression is a group of treatment styles and plans, one of which is Collaborative Care Management or CoCM. Integrated care operationalizes the principles of the chronic care model to improve access to evidence-based treatments for primary care patients. Integrated care is based on six key principles: (a) based on research evidence, (b) measurement based, (c) team based, (d) population based, (e) patient centered, and (6) accountable. Meta-analysis demonstrates that integrated care is cost-effective across diverse practice settings, patient populations, and disorders. Un\u00fctzer et al. conducted Project IMPACT, the _definitive_ randomized effectiveness study demonstrating the effectiveness of CoCM, a specific form of integrated care, for depression [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0001), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0002)]. Other CoCM trials (e.g., PROSPECT, RESPECT, and PRISM) that were conducted at approximately the same time and targeted depression/anxiety demonstrated its effectiveness for anxiety disorders [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0004)], as well as postpartum depression [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0006)] and PTSD [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0007)].\n\nAs is consistent with other innovations, it has taken about 17 years to shift the focus from establishing an evidence base for integrated care to innovating on how to take these evidence-based approaches and implementing them into routine practices [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0008)]. Identifying barriers to and key strategies of implementing evidence-based integrated care approaches in real-world settings and high need populations is now a primary research and clinical focus to provide the opportunity for more patients to access much-needed care. [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#T1) and the remainder of this paper outline current and future areas of research for integrated care.\n\n### Table 1.\n\nFuture research directions for integrated care\n\n| Area of research | Example |\n| --- | --- |\n| Practice considerations |  |\n| Technology to scale access | How can technology support but not interfere with the implementation of integrated care? |\n| Workforce | How can strategies for education/training be incorporated into implementation science research? Can specific education/training interventions improve implementation? |\n| Payment | What are the barriers to using existing payment mechanisms? How should existing payment models be refined to support sustained implementation? |\n| Frameworks | What are the theoretical underpinnings of a specific intervention effort and do they mediate the overall intervention effect? |\n| Population needs |  |\n| Addressing disparities | What are the variances in intervention effect by population or region?

Telephone technologies may help depressed patients receive additional individualized support without having to leave their homes. In a study integrating technology and family therapy, depressed caregivers were linked to their family and with support outside of the home, as well as the therapist having enhanced access to both the caregivers and their family members. Caregivers in the combined family therapy and technology intervention experienced a greater reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 and 18 month follow-ups than those in other interventions [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0009)]. Among individuals with cancer and depression, centralized telecare management paired with automated symptom monitoring resulted in improved pain and depression outcomes in cancer patients in rural areas [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0010)].\n\nUsing technology to deliver the primary intervention has offered the possibility for existing therapies to be more accessible, as well as enabled the development of novel target interventions. Most recently, therapeutic video game technology (Project: EVO) was found to be just as effective as problem-solving therapy when it came to improving mood and self-reported function in individuals with late-life depression [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0011)]. A study by Arean et al. found that the therapeutic video game technology (EVO) and iPST, a problem-solving therapy app, had a positive impact on both depression and disability outcomes as compared to the treatment control, which was an app that provided daily health tips [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0012)]. In addition, passive sensing technologies can be used to predict depressive mood states before the patient expresses them. A recent study found that changes in daily physical activity collected with smartphone GPS and accelerometer technology were predictive of different mood states before the patient themselves reported changes in mood [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0013)]. This technology can promptly alert clinicians and allow for a change in treatment or expedited intervention.\n\n### Address workforce needs\n\nAn important consideration to increase the implementation of integrated care approaches is workforce training needs. Delivering care using integrated care approaches is currently a rarely part of training programs [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0014), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0015)] or practicum experiences; currently, much of this training is being acquired on the job as a best practice [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0016)]. For example, Horevitz and Manoleas report that 66% of social work respondents reported learning the majority of the skills and competencies necessary for integrated care on the job [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0015)]. This same study reports that the least familiar skills are also some of those that are foundational for evidence-based integrated care models, such as stepped care and behavioral activation. Similar challenges in workforce preparedness have also been identified in the psychiatric workforce, with only about half of psychiatric residency training programs offering didactic training in integrated care [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0017)].\n\nAs evidence increases in the effectiveness of using technology to scale integrated care, such as the reports from Leung et al. and Carleton et al. in this special issue, another important workforce challenge is preparing the workforce for this shift in practice [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0018), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0019)]. Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 60 released by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) summarizes the areas of technical skills that need to be developed in the workforce to take advantage of using technology as part of mental health care, including the core skills of comfort with technology and how to integrate technologies into clinical practice. This resource highlights that using digital modalities to communicate about health care and identifying which digital technologies are safe and appropriate to recommend can be nontrivial adaptions that need to take into consideration privacy. As another example, internet cognitive behavioral therapy has now been shown to be an effective strategy to improve outcomes, but using this approach requires training of the provider [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0018)]. These approaches are needed to deliver on the promise of integrated care but will benefit from additional studies to identify when and how to incorporate them into integrated care practice.\n\nGiven these important workforce needs, research on effective strategies to skill up the integrated care workforce will be critical. Although there has been some early work starting to define the educational needs of the integrated care behavioral health workforce [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0020), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0021)], there are important research questions about the most effective educational approaches to teach these skills. This could include more explorations of education and training as part of implementation research or the testing of specific educational strategies to teach integrated care for both clinicians in training and already practicing in the workforce.\n\n### Payment for collaborative care\n\nExisting fee-for-service payment systems are ill aligned with and seriously inadequate to support integrated care. Lack of payment has, thus, been identified as a major barrier to sustained implementation of collaborative care [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0022), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0023)]. Recognizing the critical role of payment, several state-wide implementations of collaborative care adopted case rate or lump sum payment. Notably, Minnesota\u2019s DIAMOND initiative, a consortium among private/nonprofit payers and provider organizations, adopted a fixed monthly case rate to cover the cost of ongoing collaborative care not covered by visit-based physician payment. The Mental Health Integration Program (MHIP) in Washington State among community health centers (CHCs) was sponsored by public funding and a major Medicaid managed care plan until 2018. It adopted an annual lump sum payment to CHCs based on minimum caseload expectations, and, since 2009, withheld 25% of the payment to reward CHCs for achieving prespecified depression treatment and outcome targets [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0024), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0025)]. Starting January 2017, the federal Medicare program started reimbursing for collaborative care with additional, fee-for-service payment codes structured based on the month of care (first vs. subsequent months) and minimum accumulated minutes of care (70 min in the first month, 60 min in subsequent months with possible additional payment for increments of 30 min) [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0026)]. Little empirical data at the national level have been published, but it is believed that adoption of the Medicare codes has been lackluster [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0027)]. A qualitative study based on interviews with 12 health care organizations and 2 payer organizations regarding the adoption of these codes revealed difficulties in workflow changes, both clinical and billing related [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0028)]; for example, discussing possible cost-sharing with patients and obtaining consent to information sharing with other providers, tracking the accumulation of time in direct patient encounters (by all providers) over a month, and revenue transfer between departments (mainly primary care and psychiatry) [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0028)]. While these difficulties are not insurmountable, system-level barriers, such as payment codes not consistently offered by all payers and uncertainty regarding the financial sustainability of billing for these codes, constitute more fundamental barriers.\n\nFurther refinements of the Medicare codes are expected in coming years, as well as increased provision of coverage for collaborative care by private payers. Research examining early experience with the Medicare codes and financial implications for health care provider organizations and payers (e.g., potential cost-savings as a result of covering collaborative care) is needed to support stakeholder decision-making in this area. Another area of investigation concerns payment innovations that do not directly target collaborative care and, yet, at least conceptually, are highly aligned with collaborative care implementation. One example is Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) that hold health care organizations accountable for the quality and total health care costs of a defined patient population [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0029)]. As rules for the Medicare ACO program continue to evolve toward increased accountability by accelerating the move to two-sided risks (i.e., ACOs sharing in financial losses, as well as savings), embedded incentives for behavioral health integration and for collaborative care implementation are arguably stronger [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0030)]. Future research should continue to monitor ACO implementation of collaborative care, processes and outcomes, and lessons learned.\n\n### Frameworks for real-world integrated care\n\nIn the implementation of integrated care in primary care, a plethora of models and approaches are being adopted and experimented with, many without solid evidence of effectiveness. If models developed out of high-quality randomized trials are considered \u201cgold standard,\u201d approaches adopted in real practices reflect resource constraints, as well as preferences and feasibilities dictated by local circumstances. Two prominent questions are: first, can we identify \u201clighter\u201d versions of integrated care that fall short of the gold standard and still achieve minimum acceptable effectiveness and cost-effectiveness? And, second, how do we guide primary care practices in adopting such lighter models and in incrementally improving and enhancing their implementation? Three papers in the current issue directly address these two questions. In particular, Stephens et al. [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0031)] developed and assessed a framework of core principles and mapped structures and processes to encompass different models of integrated behavioral health care in primary care. This framework provides a shared community definition and standards for a state-wide initiative to advance behavioral health integration in primary care. The continuum-based framework reported on in Goldman et al. [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0032)] was specifically in response to the needs of small primary care practices (or, more generally, practices with limited resources) and defined eight domains of integrated care and subdomains representing graded stages of implementation. Williams et al. [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0033)], on the other hand, proposes practical and measurable definitions for three interrelated components of integrated care (and of chronic condition management in general), namely care coordination, care management, and case management, in an effort to facilitate implementation, fidelity assessment and improvement, and continued development of integrated care approaches.\n\nThese three studies address the second question posed above (\u201chow to guide primary care practices in adopting and incrementally enhancing integrated care models\u201d) by developing unifying frameworks as a compass for practice reorganization. While such efforts are incredibly valuable, lighter versions that result from such frameworks are potentially large in number and the evidence base for them remain weak [[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0034)]. Since many of these versions have emerged or will emerge in real-world implementation, observational studies, rather than randomized trials with factorial designs, may hold promise for rigorous evidence that also capture the variety of naturally occurring integrations. One social science method, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) [[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0035), [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0036)], may be especially well suited to identify lighter versions that are associated with improvements in patient outcomes. Unlike regression-based analysis that assumes independent effects of factors, QCA identifies combinations (or configurations) of factors contributing to an outcome. In addition, it identifies potentially multiple configurations that represent alternative paths to the outcome, a property known as equifinality [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0037)]. Both of these features are highly aligned with the need to identify alternative, lighter versions of integrated care (defined by combinations of components, structures, and processes) that are causally associated with improvement in clinical and other patient outcomes.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)ADDRESSING POPULATION NEEDS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Ameliorate disparities\n\nIn spite of the tremendous mental health need, many adults with depression do not receive mental health care. Barriers continue to include affordability, availability (i.e., supply of health care resources in a given area), accessibility, acceptability, and accommodation [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0038)]. These factors contribute to the pervasive disparities that remain among minority ethnic/racial, gender, sexual orientation, language, and age groups. In New York City, among adults with depression, only 38% had mental health treatment in the past year [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0039)]. A recent analysis using a representative population sample of older adults and disaggregating racial/ethnic groups found significant differences in rates of depression among ethnic and racial groups [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0040)]. The increasing awareness of the disparities has led to opportunities and innovations that promote the integration of mental health into nonmental health sites and strategies to design programs that address as many barriers as possible.\n\nThe integration of mental health into primary care has taken steps to reduce barriers to accessibility and acceptability. The widespread use of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) has contributed to improved detection and measurement-based care in multiple languages, reducing barriers to medication treatment among individuals who speak a language other than English. Yet, barriers remain and include: (a) the availability of trained providers in general and those who speak languages other than English and (b) challenges facing individuals with multiple comorbidities.\n\nYet, it is not all bleak. Investigators have identified innovations emerging that offer ways of addressing need. They include embedding mental health in new settings (e.g., senior centers), integration across service sites, and using alternative providers (e.g., lay people) [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0041)]. To address need among vulnerable older adults, mental health education, screening, and therapy have been integrated into elder justice services and senior centers implemented by the New York City Department for the Aging and funded by ThriveNYC in New York City. The New York State Office of Mental Health has funded demonstration programs that have \u201ctriple partnerships\u201d of mental health, substance use disorder, and aging services providers to reduce the silos that limit care and address the unmet needs of older adults who require these services.\n\n### Integration of substance use disorder and mental health treatment\n\nFor a variety of policy and payment reasons, silos between the systems of care that address substance use disorders and mental health disorders have evolved with many barriers to integration of treatment. Yet, co-occurrence between mental health disorders and substance use disorders is common. Integrated care approaches in which whole person care is delivered appear to be an ideal approach to address this common challenge. However, few studies have addressed how to effectively use an integrated care approach to address co-occurring conditions.\n\nTo address this research gap, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently funded four studies as part of the large Helping to End Addiction Long-term initiative. These studies were funded specifically to explore how a collaborative care approach could be optimized to address opioid use disorder (OUD) and co-occurring common mental health disorders in primary care. The studies were required to address key research questions, including how to use pragmatic designs and deployment-focused interventions that are feasible to implement in existing clinical practice settings, how to serve diverse patient populations (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities and pregnant women), how to implement in clinics with known variation in implementation readiness and existing site resources, what are the costs and cost-effectiveness of the collaborative care approach, how to streamline workflows through routine screening and efficient referral pathways to medication-based treatment for OUD and mental health treatment, and how to reduce the alarming rates of mortality associated with OUD. The four funded studies plan to use providers with diverse backgrounds and training (e.g., nurses vs. medical assistants) in key behavioral health care manager roles, use different approaches to identifying patients in need of treatment, use different strategies for care delivery (in person and telephone), and address different co-occurring disorders (anxiety, depression, and PTSD). The focus on hybrid design to test both effectiveness and implementation strategies will likely continue to be a strategic approach as we try to close the gap from protocols to practice. The opportunity to compare the different strategies that the research groups took may also have important implications for how to continue to adapt integrated care approaches and inform future studies in this important population.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)RESEARCH DESIGN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Patient engagement in designing interventions\n\nIt is a widely accepted premise that community-academic partnerships yield more effective research designs, relevant interventions, and increase sustainability. And yet, often the \u201cend user\u201d is not involved. This omission may reflect the lack of recognition of the importance of individual and community participation in the design and implementation of interventions. In addition, researchers may face pragmatic barriers (e.g., difficulty recruiting depressed individuals to participate) and funding limitations (e.g., the financial limits on pilot projects) that affect the timeline of intervention development. Recognizing the importance of a deployment model, NIMH has placed a priority on bringing information about typical patients, providers, settings, and multiple stakeholder groups into intervention development and testing. This emphasis is embedded into the NIMH strategic plan for community-based interventions.\n\nThis emphasis on the integration of individual and community perspectives is echoed in studies that have found that mental health research translates more easily to real health care settings when patients are emotionally and intellectually involved in the research question and have an understanding of their role within the process [[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0042)]. Implementing a user-centered design can improve the integration of evidence-based practices in such services [[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0043)]. Examples of this approach include receiving input from patients on research design (as part of the research team) or activities in which patients and providers work alongside one another to create changes to service design or delivery [[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0044)]. Researchers have found that once patient engagement becomes practice, it also leads to further patient participation by creating a culture of collaboration and reducing the power dynamic between providers and their patients. As a result, patient engagement is associated with improved outcomes for depression and anxiety in adults, thus making it a priority in the design of mental health intervention research.\n\n### Mechanisms of successful interventions\n\nUnderstanding intervention effectiveness is the first step toward translating evidence-based integrated care models into everyday practice. For successful studies, we need to identify the mechanisms of effect of those interventions. The mediational and moderating variables selected and tested become incredibly important to future research, and that kind of research is just now being conducted and published. Mechanistic analyses of this type often get swallowed in the press of other competing activities, as they are complex and require key statistical applications, as well as clear thinking about the application of a theoretical model [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0045)]. However, research focused on mechanisms of action of integrated care implementation is key toward a next generation of effectiveness studies that are even more powerful than the initial generation. A good recent example is a study that was done in New York, identifying several key mechanisms of action for collaborative care in practice settings [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0039)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)IMPORTANCE OF PRAGMATIC STUDY DESIGN\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvestigators should consider recent contributions to study design to strengthen intervention research and to use the most rigorous design possible while still taking into account real-world requirements and constraints. In a recent webinar, Curran et al. articulated designs like the hybrid effectiveness design, which accounts for constraints on sample size and control group assignment while allowing for clear rigorous evaluation of outcomes [[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0046), [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/#CIT0047)]. These and other design features and statistical approaches are necessary to move the field forward with speed but scientific quality and could be considered for funding and collaboration in multiple settings.\n\n### Use of this issue\n\nWe propose that the contents of this special issue be seen as an initial foray into the diversity of issues that need to be studied in integrated care. We hope that the contents of this special issue published in _Translational Behavioral Medicine_ will act as a stimulus to others to contribute to some of these research ideas. There are many unanswered questions about the implementation of integrated care in the USA, and we want to see more contributions to that literature. We hope that this content will suggest ideas and stimulate funders and investigators to pursue them. Finding a home in _Translational Behavioral Medicine_ for this kind of transdisciplinary and innovative research is one step in the process of translating basic treatment findings into practice and public health objectives, but it is a necessary step and one that we hope will have effects beyond this journal issue.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)Funding:\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo funding necessary; this is an introduction paper to a special issue.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8453803/)Compliance with Ethical Standards\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conflicts of Interest:** The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n**Ethical Approval:** This article does not contain any studies with human participants performed by any of the authors.

Clinical symptoms are painless jaundice or abdominal or back pain. Less specific symptoms often appear that make diagnosis difficult, e.g., weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and general weakness. Only 10\u201320% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage. A cure is practically only possible with a radical surgical operation. In the case of locally advanced findings, neoadjuvant therapy is administered. Among the therapeutic options offered are chemotherapy, radiotherapy (including stereotactic radiotherapy\u2014SBRT), targeted treatment, or immunotherapy. In the case of metastatic disease, of which more than half are present at diagnosis, the goal is to relieve the patient of problems. Metastatic PDAC can cause problems arising from the localization of distant metastases, but it also locally affects the organs it infiltrates. In our review article, we focus on the largest group of patients, those with locally advanced disease and metastatic disease\u2014symptoms related to the infiltration or destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma and the growth of the tumor into the surrounding. Therefore, we deal with biliary or duodenal obstruction, gastric outlet syndrome, bleeding and thromboembolic diseases, pain, depression, and fatigue, as well as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and malnutrition. Metastatic spread is most often to the liver, peritoneum, or lungs. The presented overview aims to offer current therapeutic options across disciplines. In accordance with modern oncology, a multidisciplinary approach with a procedure tailored to the specific patient remains the gold standard.\n\n**Keywords:** pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, palliative care, supportive care\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)1. Introduction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignant tumor originating from the exocrine cells of the pancreas. It is most often adenocarcinoma (up to 95 percent), and the rest are cystic tumors or other rare types [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B1-biomedicines-11-02690)]. The malignant cells themselves originate from the epithelium of the pancreatic ducts. Risk factors include age (peak incidence in the 7\u20138th decade); smoking; excessive alcohol intake; or dietary factors such as a higher intake of meat, cholesterol, and fried foods [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B2-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Patients with a hereditary burden (p53 mutation, Lynch syndrome, BRCA 2 mutation), hereditary pancreatitis (trypsinogen gene defect), chronic pancreatitis, or type 2 diabetes are also at higher risk. PDAC, like most tumors, arises through a multi-stage process where the cumulative effect of individual mutations in individual genes, gene amplification, structural rearrangements, and deletion or loss of heterozygosity apply. The most frequent mutations occur in proto-oncogenes (K-ras, HER-2/neu) or tumor suppressor genes (p16, p53, BRCA 2, DPC4/SMAD4) [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B3-biomedicines-11-02690)]. On the basis of these genetic changes, risk lesions with malignant potential are described (PanIN (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia), together with IPMN (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms) and MCN (mucinous cystic neoplasms) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B4-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Pancreatic cancer can be clinically asymptomatic until late stages or have non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, or loss of appetite. Possible symptoms are based on the localization of the tumor\u2014obstructive icterus when present in the head of the pancreas, vomiting in the case of duodenal oppression, and pain in the epigastrium with propagation to the back. At an advanced stage, stiff resistance in the epigastrium, ascites, or shortness of breath with metastatic involvement of the lungs may appear as the first symptom [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B5-biomedicines-11-02690)]. As part of the diagnosis, it is possible to find a pancreatic tumor using abdominal ultrasound, abdominal contrast CT, or endosonography (EUS). Many clinical studies are trying to determine the ideal marker with which it would be possible to diagnose tumors at an early stage [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B6-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood or specific molecules in the stool are looked for. Finding these molecules could lead to a breakthrough in the care of PDAC patients. In recent years, there has been an enormous effort in the field of scientific research to find a suitable methodology for effective screening [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B2-biomedicines-11-02690),[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B5-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nSo far, PDAC is still at the lower end of the survival rate despite great advances in medicine in recent decades. The incidence of PDAC is increasing, and it is projected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality by 2030. Most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced (30\u201335%) or metastatic (50\u201355%) disease [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B7-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Currently, the five-year survival rate is less than 10%. Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment if the tumor is identified at a resectable stage. Due to non-specific or non-existent symptoms in the early stages, we often discover tumors suitable for surgery accidentally during the examination of patients rather for other reasons [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B8-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Due to the large number of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and locally advanced PDAC, in this review article, we focus on the most common symptoms and their treatment options according to current recommendations. According to NCCN guidelines, the main symptoms encountered in clinical practice are biliary obstruction, gastric outlet/duodenal obstruction, thromboembolic disease, bleeding from the primary tumor, pain, depression and fatigue, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and malnutrition, with symptoms resulting from the local growth of the tumor, its metastasis (most often to the liver, peritoneum, and lungs), and the production of various molecules [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B9-biomedicines-11-02690),[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B10-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)2. Biliary Obstruction\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPainless jaundice is perceived as one of the most common manifestations in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head and occurs in approximately three-quarters of this population [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B9-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Obstruction is primarily caused by the growing tumor compressing the bile ducts from the outside or by endoluminal growth. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with the introduction of a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is the gold standard for biliary drainage [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B11-biomedicines-11-02690)].. ERCP is preferred over percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBC) due to longer survival rates, fewer infectious complications, and shorter hospitalizations [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B12-biomedicines-11-02690)]. A plastic stent should not be inserted due to the need for regular replacements, as well as more frequent complications such as blockage or cholangitis, so that a metallic stent is ultimately more advantageous despite the higher initial price [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B13-biomedicines-11-02690)]. In recent years, thanks to technological progress, the concept of EURCP (endoscopic ultrasound retrograde cholangiopancreatography) has been promoted in specialized centers. It was possible to connect the diagnostic accuracy of EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) with the therapeutic possibilities of ERCP. Previously, in the event of failure to ensure drainage of the bile ducts, it was necessary to use PTBC or proceed to surgery. Today, the benefits of EURCP can be exploited with success [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B14-biomedicines-11-02690)]. One possibility is the detection of dilated bile ducts via EUS and their puncture in a suitable place. A wire is introduced, which then passes through the major duodenal papilla. After visualization of the location of the bile duct, the bile ducts are opened by ERCP (the EUS-rendezvous technique\u2014EUS RV) [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B15-biomedicines-11-02690)]. With gradual use in practice, several other options have been developed to ensure the drainage of the bile ducts (see [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#biomedicines-11-02690-f001)). If it is impossible to insert a guide wire through the major duodenal papilla, it is possible to drain the bile directly into the stomach antegradely. Another option is hepaticogastrostomy (HGS) or choledochoduodenostomy (CDS). When performing transmural stenting, a special stent\u2014a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS)\u2014has been designed for this purpose [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B16-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Image 9: Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3c5a/10603964/3c1988e1172f/biomedicines-11-02690-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10603964_biomedicines-11-02690-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/figure/biomedicines-11-02690-f001/)\n\nEUS-guided biliary drainage methods: (1) antegrade stenting; (2) and (4) transmural stenting with two kinds of techniques: (2) hepaticogastrostomy (preferred bile duct segment 3 or left liver) and (4) choledochoduodenostomy; (3) the rendezvous technique [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B16-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nThe previously often-used PTBC is gradually being replaced by EURCP. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Hayat et al. compared technical and clinical success rate and acute, delayed, and total adverse events of EUS-BD (biliary drainage) with PTBC. The result showed that EUS-BD is comparably effective but safer in terms of acute and overall adverse events for biliary decompression in patients with malignant biliary strictures for whom ERCP has failed [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B17-biomedicines-11-02690)]. It is also comparable to the effectiveness of surgical procedures and is increasingly used due to its minimal invasiveness [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B18-biomedicines-11-02690),[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B19-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)3. Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGastric outlet obstruction of any degree is described in approximately one-sixth to one-fifth of patients [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B20-biomedicines-11-02690)], and one-tenth of all patients with pancreatic cancer develop symptomatic duodenal obstruction [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B21-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Patients are bothered by persistent nausea and pressure or pain in the epigastrium due to due to the inability of the contents from the stomach to move on. The main goal of therapy is the relief of symptoms and, if possible, the restoration of oral intake [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B22-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Symptoms can be influenced by diet modification or medication. Prokinetics, antiemetics, or analgesics have been used with partial success. In terms of restoring food intake naturally, we have a choice of endoscopic or surgical methods. In a good clinical condition, surgical gastrojejunostomy via either a laparoscopic or an open approach is possible. Compared to an enteric stent inserted endoscopically, this has a longer effect and a lower frequency of reinterventions, with the cost of longer hospitalization and the higher financial cost of the procedure [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B23-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Currently, with the increased availability of quality gastrointestinal endoscopy, the use of enteric stents is the preferred method (see [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#biomedicines-11-02690-f002)). It is possible to perform this in a shorter time horizon. Moreover, it leads to a faster relief, according to a study by Orr et al. who compared the effect of an enteric stent in patients with PDAC and other malignancies in terms of the need for reintervention. Only 1 patient out of 26 patients with PDAC had to be re-intervented, compared to 6 patients out of 16 with other malignancies (OR: 0.064, 95% CI: 0.01\u20130.60) [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B24-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Unfortunately, according to studies to date, neither method has an effect on life expectancy. However, after endoscopic stenting, some patients may be candidates for systemic therapy [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B25-biomedicines-11-02690),[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B26-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n[![Image 10: Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3c5a/10603964/89376b273616/biomedicines-11-02690-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10603964_biomedicines-11-02690-g002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/figure/biomedicines-11-02690-f002/)\n\nEnteral stent. (**A**) Endoscope with guidewire through the stenosis; (**B**) stent in the correct position (Author: Prof. Tomas Hucl, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic).\n\nThe third option, the already mentioned LAMS (lumen-apposing metallic stent), has also been used in these cases in recent years (see [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#biomedicines-11-02690-f003)). This new technique ideally combines the advantages of minimal invasiveness of an endoscopic procedure and the long-term effect of a surgical solution [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B27-biomedicines-11-02690)]. The new CABRIOLET study evaluated the most appropriate therapy for combined bile duct obstruction and gastric outlet obstruction. Five possible approaches, namely, enteral stenting (ES), EUS-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE), hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS), choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS), and transpapillary biliary stenting (TPS), were assessed for dysfunction during follow-up. Although the authors assessed insufficient statistical evidence for individual combinations, it appears that the combination of EUS-GE+HGS or EUS-GE+TPS may lead to better patency [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B28-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Image 11: Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3c5a/10603964/db2060dec0b7/biomedicines-11-02690-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10603964_biomedicines-11-02690-g003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/figure/biomedicines-11-02690-f003/)\n\nLAMS.

Thromboembolic Disease\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCancer is an independent and major risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), including catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). PDAC carries the highest risk of VTE of all cancers, with VTE rates ranging from 5 to 41% in retrospective cohorts and up to 67% in postmortem series [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B29-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nDetailed pathological mechanisms and relationships between individual pathways are still the subject of intensive studies [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B30-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Recommendation of the International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer agreed on the primary prevention of thromboembolism using LMWH (low-molecular-weight heparin) or DOAC (direct oral anticoagulants\u2014in the case rivaroxaban or apixaban) in ambulatory patients at low risk of bleeding with metastatic pancreatic tumor on antitumor treatment [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B31-biomedicines-11-02690)]. In the case of a higher risk of bleeding, LMWH remains the standard of therapy. More recently, DOAC is also recommended for patients with VTE, especially in the absence of a tumor mass in the lumen of the digestive tract [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B32-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)5. Bleeding from Primary Tumor Site\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBleeding into the gastrointestinal tract is a rare but serious complication of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mainly due to difficult hemostasis. According to Takada et al., approximately 36% of all PDAC patients have duodenal infiltration, and 2.6% of PDAC patients manifest primarily with gastrointestinal bleeding [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B33-biomedicines-11-02690)]. The first and most affordable response is therapeutic endoscopy with several hemostatic options available. The most common are adrenaline injection, clipping, hemospray, or stent insertion, or a combination of these modalities. If this fails, TAE (transarterial embolization), surgery, and radiation are offered. TAE is more suitable for arterial bleeding. In the case of choosing a surgical solution, we must expect a possible increase in complications and a failure to improve the patient\u2019s prognosis. Radiation, if not previously performed in the tumor area, can stop bleeding if the endoscopy fails [[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B34-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)6. Pain\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost PDAC patients have pain at the time of diagnosis, although the pain intensity varies depending on the PDAC location in the pancreas, the person\u2019s anatomy, and the presence of metastatic lesions or local invasion [[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B35-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nManaging pain as a common symptom in advanced pancreatic cancer can be a challenge. When it is successfully managed, the quality of life improves. However, it often requires a multidisciplinary and sometimes invasive approach, which is not available in all healthcare institutions [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B36-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Early referral of the patient to a palliative specialist can improve tailoring of treatment [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B37-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nPain management modalities include medications, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, interventions, and alternative approaches. In the case of mild pain, it is advisable to proceed according to the analgesic ladder. In the case of severe pain, it is sometimes necessary to skip the ladder and proceed directly to opioids and their derivatives (see [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#biomedicines-11-02690-t001)). Administration is possible orally, transdermally, sublingually, or intranasally [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B38-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Opioids must be used carefully in view of their considerable potential for side effects, particularly sedation and respiratory depression, itching, nausea, and constipation. Stool softeners and laxatives for constipation, diphenhydramine for itching, and antiemetics for nausea are recommended as prevention or relief [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B39-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Corticoids, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants are also used as adjuvant drugs to deal with side effects [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B40-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nPain control is largely implemented as a secondary objective in trials evaluating chemotherapyregimens in PDAC. Radiotherapy is particularly effective in controlling and relieving pain caused by large tumors pressing on other organs or structures, such as nerves or the spine. The effect of radiotherapy is usually late and appears many weeks after the start of treatment. Radiotherapy can shrink the tumor, which may help in relieving the pain [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B41-biomedicines-11-02690)]. An alternative approach is to use a celiac plexus block or neurolysis and can be performed minimally invasively under CT or endoscopically under EUS control or surgically [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B39-biomedicines-11-02690),[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B42-biomedicines-11-02690),[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B43-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Intrathecal therapy can be suggested for terminal stages or in refractory pain. The implantable intrathecal drug delivery systems are an alternative with reduced drug toxicity and improved pain scores. Various molecules can be used, including morphine, fentanyl, local anesthetics, baclofen, and/or clonidine [[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B44-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Of the alternative approaches, a systemic review published in 2012, including a total of 15 randomized controlled trials, showed that acupuncture is an effective adjunctive method in the treatment of cancer pain, and relief from pain was better when compared to drug therapy alone [[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B45-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Hypnosis is also one of the approaches used to control pain. Several studies confirm that it is useful in reducing cancer-related pain, modulating the sensation of pain by functional disconnection between the prefrontal cortex, the decision center and the anterior cingulate cortex [[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B46-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n### Table 1.\n\nRecommended oral analgesics for treatment of PDAC according to Hameed et al.

Depression and Fatigue\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDue to the severity of metastatic PDAC, depression and fatigue occur quite often. Their timely detection is therefore absolutely essential [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B47-biomedicines-11-02690)]. In practice, numerical analogue scales, a thermometer, or simple scoring systems are used to detect this. Patients, along with oncologists and other healthcare professionals, must balance between realistic expectations and life-limiting diagnosis [[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B48-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nThe prevalence of depression has been shown to be up to seven times higher in PDAC patients than in the general population. A meta-analysis of six prospective studies calculated that up to 43% of patients were depressed after the diagnosis. Therefore, it is essential to seek out these patients and adequately help them from the beginning of the diagnosis. It should be borne in mind that depression can appear with an illness or at any time later when the patient is already being treated for it. The initial assessment depends on factors that could trigger it, such as the disease itself, the treatment or symptoms, or an adverse social environment. It is appropriate for the patient to be referred for formal assessment of the problem by the palliative care team. Therapy includes, in addition to optimal symptom management, psychotherapy, psychotropic drugs, and the involvement of a social worker or chaplain service. Attention should also be paid to close relatives of the patient, who also have a higher risk of depression, with the use of anxiolytics or the long-term use of hypnotics [[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B49-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nThe non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue consists in physical activity, carefully optimized with regard to the patient\u2019s goals and limited by the scope of the disease. It is necessary to consider whether the patient has bone metastases, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fever or active infection, or other limitations resulting from metastases or comorbidities [[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B50-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Fatigue can also be influenced by medication. Methylphenidate, which is still under research, with exact doses and dosages not yet determined, and corticoids, namely, prednisone and dexamethasone, are considered in a short-term regimen [[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B51-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)8. Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency and Malnutrition\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is one of the causes of malnutrition and weight loss in PDAC patients [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B52-biomedicines-11-02690)]. In general, the reason for PEI may be destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma by the tumor, obstruction of the pancreatic duct, fibrosis of the gland, or surgery associated with resection of the pancreas. PEI and malnutrition have a negative effect on the quality of life and the management of complications resulting from the disease or treatment, and they also shorten life expectancy [[53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B53-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Despite this, nutritional therapy is not everywhere an integrated part of a comprehensive approach [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B54-biomedicines-11-02690)]. A rapid evaluation and referral of the patient to a diet specialist is necessary.\n\nThe standard PEI therapy is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT); a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that its use was associated with a 3.8 month increase in survival (95% confidence interval: 1.37\u20136.19), and patients had a trend towards a better quality of life [[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B52-biomedicines-11-02690)]. The dosage is in accordance with the European recommendations for chronic pancreatitis and recent review on PERT in PDAC [[55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B55-biomedicines-11-02690),[56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B56-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Roeyen et al. recommend considering 40,000\u201350,000 units of lipase to be taken with each meal and 25,000 units to be taken with each snack as a suitable starting dose. It is also appropriate to administer PERT to achieve optimal nutritional status in all patients who have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy or palliative therapy. The effectiveness of PERT is evaluated based on the alleviation of maldigestion-related symptoms (e.g., steatorrhea, weight loss, flatulence) and the normalization of the patients\u2018 nutritional status [[57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B57-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Proton pump inhibitors can be given as adjuvant therapy to prevent inactivation of PERT by gastric acids and thus improve the response [[58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B58-biomedicines-11-02690)]. PDAC patients are also more prone to small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) than healthy individuals. SIBO can aggravate the symptoms of digestive discomfort through multiple factors that affect the small intestine [[59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B59-biomedicines-11-02690)]. _Rifaximin_, a non-absorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic, may bring symptoms relief via restoration of healthy bowel microbiota [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B60-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nRegarding parenteral nutrition, this should be considered in the case of expected survival longer than 2\u20133 months, whenever severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, or gastrointestinal obstruction do not allow enteral feeding and at the same time the usual procedures described in the previous text do not bring any improvement in status [[61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B61-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)9. Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPDAC has a tendency to early progression to metastatic disease [[62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B62-biomedicines-11-02690)]. It is often able to metastasize, even in the case of a small primary tumor. In the case of metastatic disease, the liver is affected in up to 76\u201380% of patients, the peritoneum in 48%, and the lungs in 45% [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B10-biomedicines-11-02690)]. This order was confirmed in the autopsy findings [[63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B63-biomedicines-11-02690)]. The tumor can spread by direct growth, hematogenously or lymphogenously. Surgical resection remains the only effective method for cure and long-term survival, although few patients can undergo it [[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B64-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Despite all efforts, the average survival time of metastatic PDAC is 3\u20136 months, with a 5 year survival rate of 1\u20132% [[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B65-biomedicines-11-02690)]. According to Liu et al., the median overall survival (OS) time was 6.5 months in the entire cohort, while the median OS times were 11.8, 6.9, 7.7, 10.1, and 5.0 months in patients with isolated lung, isolated liver, isolated peritoneum, isolated distant lymph nodes, and metastases at multiple sites, respectively [[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B66-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nPalliative chemotherapy prolongs the survival of PDAC survival when compared with best supportive care (BSC). While BSC patients have a median survival of around 2 months, gemcitabine-treated patients have a median survival of 5\u20136 months and PDAC patients treated with modern chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel have a median survival of 8\u201311 months [[67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B67-biomedicines-11-02690),[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B68-biomedicines-11-02690),[69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B69-biomedicines-11-02690)]. However, the overall advantage is uncertain according to some researchers, who question if the benefits of palliative chemotherapy in PDAC patients outweigh their risks. This uncertainty is further highlighted when considering a second line of chemotherapy and, thus, BSC would be an appropriate alternative in these cases [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B70-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Current research is trying to identify the groups of PDAC patients who may benefit from subsequent lines of chemotherapy regimens [[71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B71-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nLiver metastases present with symptoms such as pain, weight loss, epigastric discomfort, jaundice, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and ascites. Patients with good performance status are usually indicated for multimodal treatment including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy [[72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B72-biomedicines-11-02690)]. In the case of progression to the peritoneum, patients often suffer from abdominal pain, intestinal motility disorder, ascites, and intestinal obstruction. The use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery did not result in a significant improvement in survival or quality of life [[73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B73-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Various symptomatic therapies are often the only option. Glucocorticoids, antiemetics, analgesics, and antisecretory drugs (anticholinergics, somatostatin analogs, and proton pump inhibitors) are used. A venting gastrostomy is appropriate in the case of medication failure. Every patient needs adequate hydration. Parenteral nutrition and pain treatment should be based on the current condition and needs of the specific patient [[74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B74-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\nPatients with lung metastases usually have persistent cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and recurrent lung infections. Symptomatic non-pharmacological (cough suppression) and pharmacological treatment (demulcents, opioids, peripherally acting antitussives, or local anesthetics), as well as endobronchial brachytherapy, often relieve patients of these problems [[75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B75-biomedicines-11-02690)]. For patients with malignant pleural effusion, talc pneumodesis or indwelling pleural catheter is available. Both therapeutic procedures are considered to be equally effective in terms of dyspnea relief, post-interventional quality of life, and complication rates. Talc pnemodesis results in a higher rate of successful pleurodesis than indwelling pleural catheter (relative risk: 1.56; 95% confidence interval: [1.26; 1.92]; _p_< 0.0001) according to Hoffmann et al. [[76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B76-biomedicines-11-02690)]. Dyspnea management can be difficult, and non-pharmacological interventions may be offered by use of a face-directed ventilator, oxygen supplementation (in case of hypoxemia), a therapeutic trial with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation. Others include various breathing techniques, positioning, relaxation, meditation, self-management, physical therapy, and music therapy. Acupressure or reflexology may also be provided if available. The simultaneous use of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapy is recommended. Of the many pharmacological options, we commonly use opiates, short-acting benzodiazepines, systemic corticoids, and bronchodilators (see [Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#biomedicines-11-02690-t002)). There is insufficient evidence for antidepressants, neuroleptics, or inhaled furosemide, but they are used in clinical practice. Refractory dyspnea and life expectancy of days may lead to the offer of continuous palliative sedation [[77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B77-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n### Table 2.\n\nPharmacological options of metastatic PDAC treatment (According to [[78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B78-biomedicines-11-02690),[79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/#B79-biomedicines-11-02690)].\n\n| Medication | Dosage | Available Routes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Morphine | 1\u20135 mg/4 h | p.o., s.c., i.v. |\n| Hydromorphone | 0.2\u20131.3 mg/4 h | p.o., s.c. |\n| Lorazepam | 0.5\u20131.0 mg/6\u20138 h | p.o., s.l. |\n| Midazolam | 2.5\u20135 mg/4 h | s.c., i.v. |\n| Prednison | 5\u201340 mg/day in 1\u20132 doses | p.o. |\n| Dexamethasone | 2\u20138 mg/day in 1\u20132 doses | p.o., i.m., i.v., s.c. |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/table/biomedicines-11-02690-t002/)\n\np.o. oral, s.c. subcutaneous, s.l. sublingual, i.m. intramuscular, i.v. intravenous.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)10. Conclusions\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, unfortunately, there has been no fundamental change in PDAC therapy that would lead to a higher number of cured patients. Despite promising screening programs, the ideal tool for detecting early stages is still lacking. Slightly longer survival times and increasing incidence lead to more experience with advanced or metastatic PDAC. The growth of randomized trials in advanced PDAC is improving the care of these patients. An understanding of the molecular processes has led to recommendations for thromboembolic disease profiling. Technological progress in endoscopy has developed new methods of solving biliary or duodenal obstruction. The improved availability of palliative and supportive care has enabled the better control of pain, depression, and malnutrition, thus contributing to a better quality of life. Our review attempted to provide an overview of the current procedures and recommendations for solving problems and thus can help the experts who care for these patients in their daily practice.\n\n[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603964/)Author Contributions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR.M. writing\u2014original draft preparation; J.T. writing\u2014review and editing.

Cancer and associated care demands a tremendous burden on patients and on limited health care system resources. Increasingly, cancers are identified at earlier stages, positioning surgery as the optimal and often only chance for cure and/or management of the disease. While many patients fare well after surgery with no complications and are discharged home within expected timelines, some patients experience more complex post-\u00ad\u2010surgical courses with extended length of stay and adverse events that require additional care, re-\u00ad\u2010admission to hospital or ultimately death. Improving the outcomes of surgical care has the potential to save lives, reduce the burden of disease on patients and caregivers, and reduce health care costs. There is tremendous variability in how each province in Canada delivers cancer care services, resulting in disparities in patient outcomes that necessitate attention. At least some of these disparities can be attributed to the low population density in Canada and the need to provide services in geographically disperse centers, where not all of which can provide highly specialized surgical resources. There is a special imperative in Canada as one of the least densely populated, but highly developed countries to articulate these issues. Surgical cancer care is facing particular challenges, with rising incidence rates for most cancers and an aging population increasing the demand for these surgeries. Certain cancer surgeries, such as those for esophageal, pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancers, are particularly complex and are associated with a high risk of adverse outcomes, leading to an increased burden on health care resources. It is for this reason that this report focuses on deliberate strategies that aim to improve the organization of complex cancer surgeries in a way that enhances the quality of health care delivery. One approach that has gained considerable attention in the last two decades is the \u2018regionalization\u2019 of surgical care. There is no consensus on the precise definition of regionalization relative to the concept of consolidation of care to high volume centres. Whereas regionalization involves a deliberate re-\u00ad\u2010organization of services, consolidation has occurred in some locations where centres are simply closed and patients receive care in an alternate institution. Based on the literature and expert opinion, the following working definition of regionalization was utilized in this report: \u201cthe deliberate reorientation of cancer surgical procedures, based on explicit and planned processes and structures, with the intent of improving the quality of care\u201d This pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian report provides an objective analysis and discussion about the approach to high-\u00ad\u2010 risk, resource intensive cancer surgical procedures for esophageal, pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancers in Canada. We intend to inform policy makers, health care planners and administrators on the current state of cancer surgical care and outcomes; highlight potential opportunities for improvement; and provide actionable recommendations to improve the quality of care for individuals and families bearing the burden of cancer. P a g e | 7 METHODOLOGY This report utilized various sources to inform a comprehensive discussion on the impact of regionalization on the quality of surgical cancer care delivery in Canada. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to ascertain the current understanding of the relationship between regionalization and outcomes. Structured interviews with provincial clinical experts (Acknowledgement section) established the state of care delivery processes implemented across Canada. Patient outcomes, access to care and travel times were evaluated across the country using quantitative analyses and validated Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to objectively demonstrate how care consolidation impacts the clinical outcomes and patient experience. Finally, patient perspectives and expectations of cancer care delivery were captured from a series of citizen panels convened across three different provinces with varying health care delivery demands. KEY FINDINGS The literature provides evidence for the positive impact of regionalization on surgical cancer care \u2022 The bulk of the literature and pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian evidence supports the regionalization of cancer care, based upon objective measures such as operative mortality and length of stay. This is often expressed as a volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome relationship, where larger volume centres have better patient-\u00ad\u2010centred outcomes. \u2022 Institutional volume is regarded as the simplest and most robust metric for describing volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome relationships. Other institutional and surgeon factors likely contribute to improved patient outcomes, although they are not well discussed in the literature and it is difficult to elucidate the effects of each of the elements individually given the multifactorial nature of care. \u2022 There is no agreed upon volume threshold reported in the literature for any of the cancer types evaluated. Practically speaking, the volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome effect is demonstrated even between institutions with high case volumes; this suggests that it would be imprudent to implement a single defined procedure volume threshold. Higher volume centres predicted a significantly lower risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality and shorter length of stay in the Canadian experience \u2022 A reduced risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was significantly associated with an increase in hospital volume for esophageal, pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancer resections; whereas higher facility volume predicted a shorter length of stay for all five types of cancer resections. \u2022 The impact of hospital volume on the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was most pronounced for esophageal and pancreatic cancers. In a statistical model controlling for the influence of patient-\u00ad\u2010 and hospital-\u00ad\u2010specific factors, every 10 case increase in hospital volume predicted a risk reduction of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality of 21% and 22% for esophageal and pancreatic cancer surgeries, respectively. The calculated risk reduction was 3% and 7% for lung and ovarian cancer surgeries, respectively. P a g e | 8 There are significant disparities in patterns of practice and patient outcomes for surgical cancer care across Canada \u2022 There is a tremendous variance in in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality, resection rate, and length of stay outcomes of high-\u00ad\u2010risk cancer surgical care across Canada. o In many of the surgeries evaluated, there was a three to four times difference in mortality rates between the provinces. This difference is most broadly demonstrated by the case of esophageal cancer, where patients in Newfoundland and Labrador saw a 2.72% mortality rate while those in Manitoba have an 11% risk of death. These results are both statistically and clinically significant, and are partly due to hospital and/or surgeon volumes. This indicates a need for provinces to thoroughly investigate their current practices and to consider implementing proven strategies that mitigate or reduce the disparities. o There are substantial differences between provinces relating to resection rates for all cancers studied but ovarian, with the likelihood of receiving a potentially curative operation in a province with high resection rates can be double that of provinces with lower rates. In the case of liver cancer, patients in New Brunswick have a 6.9/100,000 resection rate, while patients residing in Alberta would expect a 14/100,000 rate of resection. These differences between rates can be due to many different factors that will influence how many patients are suitable for surgery or whether surgical services are available in a given area. Provinces should examine the distribution of stage at presentation, patient co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities, and the travel distances to care to determine if resection rates could be optimized by screening programs, rapid diagnostic workup via diagnostic assessment programs, referrals to high volume centres, or other quality improvement initiatives in order to reach ideal thresholds and improve patient survival. o The findings also report a large variance in the duration of hospital stay across the country, a fact that speaks to differences in the efficiency of the systems currently in place, or differing institutional policies. The length of stay can vary by 2-\u00ad\u20103 days (~20-\u00ad\u2010 30%) on average per patient depending on where the procedure is performed. Patients undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery demonstrate the widest difference, with the duration in hospital of Saskatchewan averaging 14 days while patients in Ontario can expect to stay 9 days. The reasons for this difference have yet to be elucidated, but may indicate differing rates of complications or surgical complexity undertaken depending on the experience and training of surgical teams. It is imperative that each province investigate causes of length of stay variance in order to improve the efficiencies of their respective systems. o The estimated hypothetical impact of surgical cancer care regionalization was considered by investigating the number of lives that could be potentially saved if all patients underwent surgery at the highest tertile volume centres, where they could expect the outcome rate demonstrated by the high volume tertile. An adjusted estimate of the potential number of lives saved is presented in Figure 1. When considering the proportion of potential lives saved relative to the number of deaths, highest gains are expected for pancreatic cancer surgeries (60%), followed by lung (30%) and ovarian (32%) cancer surgeries. These potential gains provide the impetuous to consider P a g e | 9 regionalization approaches on a provincial level or policies that discourage single surgeons within a centre. Even in the highest volume centres, quality improvement measures such as the introduction of surgical standards, staff training or uptake of best practice operative techniques have the potential to further reduce mortality. Figure 1: Potential number of lives saved through consolidation in high-\u00ad\u2010volume centres \u2022 In similar modelling, if all patients experienced the results of those in hospitals in the highest volume tertile, a total of 4775 hospital days annually could potentially have been saved. If all care was provided in high volume hospitals, 3335 hospital days associated with lung cancer cases, 308 days for liver cancer, 725 days with pancreatic cancer and 407 days with esophageal cancer surgeries would have been saved annually. The number of days could not reliably be determined for ovarian cancer surgeries. There is a lack of a unified approach for the provision of surgical cancer care in Canada \u2022 Despite the significant role of surgery in the cancer management pathway, cancer surgery management is largely not integrated under the umbrella of provincial cancer agencies. In most provinces, there are no explicit roles to oversee the systematic provision, evaluation and regulation of cancer surgery within a province. This results in a lack of accountability in most of the country and an inability to enact change or to initiate a formal process to track and evaluate outcomes. \u2022 A thorough screening of the literature for relevant policy documents along with discussions with key stakeholders in each of the provinces revealed that there is a deficit of coordinated efforts at either a provincial or national level to improve quality of complex cancer surgeries across the country. \u2022 In most provinces, there is minimal regulation as to which procedures surgeons or hospitals can or should perform within their specialty area, or how frequently they need to perform these procedures to ensure their surgical skills remain up to date. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Ovarian Lung Liver Pancreas Esophagus Total Number of Deaths Cancer Type Potential Number of Lives Saved Number of Deaths P a g e | 10 There is a need for national clinical guidelines and standards for surgical cancer care \u2022 Ontario has the most explicit regionalization policies and guidelines, with evidence of implementation for esophageal, lung, pancreatic, and liver cancer surgeries. Similar guidelines for ovarian cancer have been published, but implementation is still a work in progress at this time. Purposeful steps have been taken, although without published guidelines, to consolidate cancer surgery for certain disease sites in British Columbia (Thoracic and Gynecologic cancer surgery) and Manitoba. In the other provinces, specific policies and guidelines are either absent, unclear or unknown to the authors despite discussions with local stakeholders. Ovarian cancer: Is there a case for regionalization? \u2022 The large number of institutions delivering surgical care for patients with ovarian cancer indicates a cancer type that may benefit from regionalization policies that would bring patients requiring ovarian surgical cancer care to specialized higher volume centres. It has half the number of cases nationally as lung cancer, but three times the number of institutions performing these surgeries, with many of the centres reporting a very small total annual case volume. This may improve patient outcomes in a manner similar to that seen in other cancer types. Regionalization has an impact on travel time to surgical services \u2022 The median travel time varies greatly between provinces and is largely influenced by geography. Travel times slightly increased between 2004 and 2012 almost irrespective of patient location. \u2022 Across all cancer sites, the proportion of patients who had to travel more than one hour to access care increased as the number of centres that provide surgical cancer services decreased. This data confirms that the regionalization of some services to high volume, central locations occurs at the expense of patient travel time. Patients and Caregivers prefer better surgical care quality at the expense of longer travel distances \u2022 Three citizen panels, with 38 participants in total, were conducted in Edmonton AB, Hamilton ON and Charlottetown PEI where participants emphasized a preference for high-\u00ad\u2010 quality surgical care rather than convenience. \u2022 Participants emphasized on a strong need for the provision of a local support network to be available for patients and caregivers even in cases where cancer surgeries have been regionalized. \u2022 Participants felt that a compromise of regionalizing surgical services while facilitating local pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010operative clinical care or the utilization of telemedicine innovations may represent an optimal approach to regionalizing these complex cancer services in a way that is acceptable to the Canadian population. P a g e | 11 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS The significant variance in how surgical cancer care services are delivered between the provinces greatly impacts patient survival, efficiency of the healthcare system itself and how well patients can access care. In a prosperous country such as Canada, these disparities are unacceptable. While there are many theories for why these disparities are present, this report identified key issues that likely influence difference between the provinces. We reported significant gaps in knowledge that prevent informed decision making, a lack of surgical cancer care leadership within the continuum of cancer care, a lack of a standardized quality monitoring program, and finally minimal adoption of active regionalization policies that are likely to enact change. These factors result in an environment where best practices cannot be disseminated, and meaningful improvements in patient care are not realized to their full potential. The key recommendations noted in this report should be considered for implementation at the level of each province and in each cancer site to optimize patient care. Surgical cancer care should be integrated into the overall spectrum of provincial cancer services with the capacity for establishing systematic evaluation and the provision of sufficient resources to enact change \u2022 There should be an appointed Lead for Surgical Cancer Care for each province similar to the roles currently established for medical and radiation oncology. As with the Heads of Medical and Radiation Oncology, the Surgical Lead should be responsible for strategic planning, budget allocation, and overseeing both the development of standards of care and quality assurance activities within the province. \u2022 Given the differences in cancer care organization between the provinces, it is expected that this Surgical Cancer Care Lead role will be integrated into each province with the consideration of current surgical care organization. Despite differences in implementation, the overall role and responsibilities should be similar between provinces. Nationally-\u00ad\u2010implemented standards of care should be developed for each cancer surgery \u2022 It is recommended that a set of national standards of care be developed, similar to those that currently exist in many countries. These distinct standards need to be established based on current research and evidence in surgical cancer services to encourage excellence on both provincial and national levels. \u2022 There should be a gathering of specialty-\u00ad\u2010based communities of practice focused on defining minimal standards for practitioner certification or training, the use of consultative cancer conferences, participation in national quality improvement registries and the establishment of minimal institutional and/or surgeon case volumes. \u2022 These specialty-\u00ad\u2010based communities must consider the integration of specialized nursing, critical care and anaesthesia services, and adequate radiology and pathologic support. \u2022 The evaluation of adherence to these surgical standards of care should be integrated into existing national evaluation structures in order to measure province-\u00ad\u2010level improvements and inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial variance. P a g e | 12 Purposeful regionalization of cancer surgical services above and beyond simple consolidation is necessary to improve health care quality and patient outcomes \u2022 Volume itself is not adequate to drive improvements in outcomes. It is imperative that other quality improvement initiatives are incorporated into these centres of excellence based on the requirements outlined in the cancer site-\u00ad\u2010specific standards of care, such as staff training, technology uptake or infrastructure requirements. \u2022 The evidence presented in this report, accompanied by the reported citizens\u2019 preference for quality of care despite increased travel time, presents a strong need and support for regionalization of surgeries for high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource-\u00ad\u2010intensive cancer. Non-\u00ad\u2010regionalized institutions often lack the organizational infrastructure needed to host specialized, multidisciplinary care consistent with modern surgical cancer services. Regionalization policies should be tailored to meet unique provincial needs \u2022 It is not feasible to establish one single regionalization policy for all provinces and territories due to a need to balance access to care, geographical and health care system governance and oversight practicality factors that are individual to each jurisdiction. \u2022 The volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome effect is one that should be utilized in health care planning, but due to the relative difference in provincial populations, it is truly impractical to delineate a single national threshold for each of the cancer types. Surgical cancer care should embrace flexible implementation of regionalization policies based on access to care concerns and patient preferences \u2022 The issues relating to access to care as a consequence of regionalizing to selected centres may be ameliorated through the integration of innovative approaches that allow patients to remain at home for part of their cancer journey. \u2022 This approach can take the form of local post-\u00ad\u2010surgical care centres and/or the ability to complete diagnostic assessment pathways, telemedicine and post-\u00ad\u2010surgical consultations and tests at local facilities. A structured benchmarking process for each specialty should be supported to improve surgical outcomes and inform policy decisions \u2022 In the interest of cancer care quality improvement, all surgical care providers should participate in national disease specific registries to capture core data sets regarding patients, cancers, procedures, adverse events and oncologic outcomes. \u2022 Data collection must be partnered with explicit public data reporting, benchmarking and other quality improvement initiatives, and ideally supplemented and supported by national society derived best practice guidelines. \u2022 Registries have the potential to influence outcomes through a structured benchmarking process, where practitioners are compared to their peers via regular reporting. These reports can act as decision making tools to inform health care planners in addition to encouraging the concept of positive deviance through the sharing of best practices within a discipline.

With population growth and aging, cancer incidence has increased and is expected to continue on this trend. Surgery offers the best chance for cure for the high-\u00ad\u2010risk cancers under study ! There is no one cancer surgery delivery approach implemented in Canada, but there is increasing interest in the regionalization of cancer surgery services, an approach that has the potential to improve patient outcomes as the cornerstone of a robust quality improvement initiative ! Esophageal, pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancers require complex surgery to ideally reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates, but outcomes are highly variable on the stage of disease, extent of surgery and location of tumour ! High-\u00ad\u2010risk, complex cancer surgery carries a significant economic burden to patients and the Canadian health care system. While improving patient outcomes is ultimately the most important objective, any initiative that can reduce the burden of disease to the patient while also efficiently using limited health care resources is valuable to all stakeholders 1.1 CONTEXT OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT The absence of health impacts an individual\u2019s quality of life on a day to day basis, and also affects the ability of a society to function effectively on a broader level. It is for this reason that governments and organizations devote considerable resources and energy to improving the health status of populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that obtaining the highest possible standards of health is a fundamental right of every human being, including access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality.1 Deficiencies in care such as gaps in access or poor delivery of services affect individuals\u2019 health and quality of life. The challenge lies in devising a health care system that delivers the best possible care while also balancing the other needs of a society. Globally, all health care systems are imperfect models of care, with no one system representing the ultimate, ideal system. A good health care system combines cost conscious care with optimal outcomes, but the challenge lies in developing health care delivery strategies that engender the greatest improvement in patient outcomes. Health care organization and planning are continuous processes that must adapt to the needs of the population and the availability of resources to achieve improvements in the quality of health care. In Canada, the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase partly due to population growth and aging, so there is a definite need to re-\u00ad\u2010evaluate the delivery of P a g e | 14 cancer care services to ensure continuous quality improvement, particularly with regard to resource-\u00ad\u2010intensive cancer surgery. As the Canadian health care system considers novel approaches to improving the delivery of cancer surgical care, the Donabedian conceptual framework for quality care improvement helps to describe the relationships between the processes, structure and outcomes involved in health care system improvement.2 Improvements in outcomes are partly contingent on having quality processes, which would entail the application of best-\u00ad\u2010 practice, evidence-\u00ad\u2010based medical care. Examples include the initiation of clinical trials to develop new surgical techniques or test new chemotherapy drugs, the increasing use of minimally-\u00ad\u2010invasive surgical techniques, the establishment and measurement of quality benchmarks, the creation of recommendations requesting the specialization of surgeons and the use of multidisciplinary teams to coordinate the care of patients.3 Likewise, patient outcomes can also be improved through initiatives that focus on the structure of care, such as adaptable hospital infrastructure and strong regulatory bodies and guidelines. Interventions that target the structure of care require a large amount of coordination between health care system managers, clinicians, hospital administrators, and other key stakeholders, but can also have a high impact on patient outcomes. Structure and/or process improvements are inter-\u00ad\u2010related with improved patient outcomes, and the strongest quality improvement initiatives are those that integrate both factors. Over the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in the regionalization of cancer surgical care into specialized centres of excellence. This approach to improving the quality of cancer care offers an opportunity to integrate both process-\u00ad\u2010based and structure-\u00ad\u2010 based improvement. There is considerable variance in how these regionalization strategies have been implemented across Canada, since these decisions are left to the discretion of each province. Each province has the ability to establish quality improvement programs and approaches to health care delivery for high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource intensive cancer services. This has led to great variability across the country on surgical outcomes and the delivery of care. Heterogeneous quality of surgical care leads to higher mortality rates, longer length of stay, more post-\u00ad\u2010operative complications, and greater chances of hospital readmission, thus impacting patient health outcomes but also increasing the overall cost of health care. Throughout this discussion paper, we will present an objective analysis and discussion about the regionalized quality improvement policy approaches that have been undertaken for the provision of high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource intensive cancer surgical procedures across Canada. We present the potential benefits and limitations of this approach in the Canadian context to assist with evidence based decision making for health care policy planners and decision makers. P a g e | 15 1.2 THE BURDEN OF CANCER IN THE CANADIAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM While other chronic health conditions play a role in the increasing burden placed on the health care system, the management of cancer care is particularly resource intensive. Cancer poses a significant burden to individuals and incurs a large financial cost to the health care system. According to the 2014 Canadian Cancer Society report, 43% of Canadians are expected to develop cancer, and 25% are expected to die from cancer over a lifetime.4 It is the leading cause of death in Canada, representing nearly 30% of all deaths in 2011.4 The burden of disease associated with cancer is expected to increase with the growing aging population, with about 89% cases developing in patients over the age of 50 which will lead to an increase in case complexity and costs.4 The increasing burden of cancer care is coinciding with an economic climate where health care expenditures have increased consistently from 7% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product in 1975 upwards to 10.9% in 2014, with $214.9 billion spent in total.5 This increase in health care costs has occurred concurrently with rising inflation, an increased burden of chronic diseases and cancer, more costly modern treatment approaches and a growing aging population, a single factor that is greatly associated with higher health care costs due to increased co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities.5,6 Cancer screening remains the most cost-\u00ad\u2010effective modality for reducing the burden of disease. Conversely, cancer treatment requires a significant use of health care services,7 with cancer reported to be the 4th leading cause of hospital admissions in 2008.8 An estimated $17.4 billion dollars was spent on the direct costs of health care (physician and hospital expenses), and the indirect costs associated with a loss of productivity due to cancer therapies.9 Unfortunately, screening is presently a small part of the puzzle, since many cancers are detected at a later stage and thus require considerably more extensive surgeries and oncologic services than if a tumour was detected earlier. This is particularly true for lung, esophageal, liver, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In all these cases, surgery usually offers the greatest potential for cure relative to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.7 Surgery can be used to remove tumours or cancerous cells, to shrink tumours in preparation for radiation or chemotherapy, or to provide palliative relief from pain. Whereas the procedures and risks for cataract removal or a knee arthroplasty are relatively homogeneous between patients, cancer surgeries vary in associated risk and resource implications. The five listed cancer sites are considered to be particularly high-\u00ad\u2010 risk, resource intensive to treat surgically. These complex procedures carry a higher risk of adverse outcomes, although there is considerable variance in adverse event rates depending on non-\u00ad\u2010modifiable patient related factors (i.e. age, co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities, tumour stage), or potentially modifiable factors such as access to best-\u00ad\u2010practice care, the selection of appropriate resection approaches, surgeon skill level, availability of hospital resources, appropriate use of minimally invasive techniques, access to new technologies, hospital infrastructure and staff training. P a g e | 16 Regardless of cancer site, the absolute number of cancer surgeries increased from 137,100 in 2004-\u00ad\u201005 to 146,000 in 2007-\u00ad\u201008 despite stable age-\u00ad\u2010standardized rates,10 representing an evolving burden on health care services in the coming years. Esophageal, pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancer surgeries share this upward trend and will be introduced in the following sections. 1.3.1 ESOPHAGEAL CANCER The esophagus (or oesophagus) is a multi-\u00ad\u2010layered muscular tube and forms a portion of the digestive system. Cancer can develop at any site along the length of esophagus. The two major types of esophageal cancers are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, cancerous tumours can spread from other parts of the body (e.g. lungs, liver, or kidneys) to cause metastatic disease. The lifetime probability of developing esophageal cancer is higher in males (1 in 117) than females (1 in 319) in Canada, with an expected 5-\u00ad\u2010year survival of 14% (13% in males and 5% in females).4 The expected survival rate for surgically resected early stage cancer is much higher. However, the annual incidence rates are significantly increasing for males, showing an annual 1.4% increase from 2001 to 2010.4 Surgery remains the major curative option for esophageal cancer when used in combination with chemotherapy and radiation treatments.11 It involves the surgical removal of part or all of the esophagus. The degree of the resection depends on the location, stage, histology, and grade of esophageal cancer, as well as the patient\u2019s health status. Figure 1.1 Number of Esophageal Cancer Surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 314 301 283 304 294 323 303 354 334 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year P a g e | 17 According to hospital admissions data sourced from the Canadian Institute of Health Information, a total of 2810 esophageal cancer resections were performed in Canada (excluding Quebec) between fiscal years 2004 to 2012. The annual number of esophageal resections stayed relatively stable, with a modest 6% increase over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period (Figure 1.1). 1.3.2 PANCREATIC CANCER The pancreas is a gland that produces digestive enzymes that are transported to the small intestine through the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also produces insulin and other hormones. Cancer can develop in either the pancreas (typically endocrine tumours) or the pancreatic duct (typically exocrine tumours). Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-\u00ad\u2010related death for males and females.4 The lifetime probability of developing pancreatic cancer is 1.4% (1 in 71 for males; 1 in 69 for females) in Canada (2009).4 Although no significant changes in incidence and mortality rates are observed for pancreatic cancer over time, the expected 5-\u00ad\u2010 year survival rate remains at 7% for both genders.4 Surgery could involve the partial or total removal of the pancreas. The type of surgical procedure depends mainly on the stage of cancer, tumour location, and overall patient health. While in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rates are variable depending on resection type,12 the overall mortality rate after pancreatic cancer resections has been declining over the last 20 years.12-\u00ad\u201015 More complex procedures are associated with higher mortality rates, with most post-\u00ad\u2010operative deaths due to surgical complications.16 In the period of 2004-\u00ad\u20102012, a total of 3990 relevant pancreatic cancer resections were performed in Canada (excluding Quebec). The annual number of pancreatic cancer surgeries increased 77%, from 337 procedures in 2004 to 599 in 2012 (Figure 1.2), representing a tremendous increase in the burden of care to the health care system. P a g e | 18 Figure 1.2: Number of Pancreatic Cancer Surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 1.3.3 LIVER CANCER Liver cancer is one of the cancer types with the fastest increase in incidence rates in Canada.4,7 The annual incidence and mortality rates have significantly increased for males (2.3% and 3.2%, respectively) and females (2.4%, and 2%), with an expected 5-\u00ad\u2010year survival rate of 18%.4 Surgery remains a crucial curative treatment option to control such tumours, except for patients with advanced disease.17,18 Hepatic resection is a high risk procedure and there has been an increase in the number of such procedures performed over the last 20 years.19,20 Two-\u00ad\u2010thirds of liver resections are associated with secondary, metastasized colorectal cancers, which significantly increases the degree of surgical complexity. The impact of this complexity on surgical outcomes varies depending on the extent of surgical resection, cancer type and patient co-\u00ad\u2010 morbidities.21 There has been an increase in the number of liver resections performed over the last 20 years. A pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian study reported an 80% increase in the rate of liver resections performed from 1995 to 2004, an increase from 3.2 cases per 100,000 adults in 1995 to 5.9 cases per 100,000 adults in 2004.19 More recent data obtained from the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) reported that the number of liver resection cases has increased from 693 in 2004 to 1265 in 2012, representing an 82% increase over this 9-\u00ad\u2010year period (Figure 1.3). 337 396 400 401 416 456 452 533 599 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year P a g e | 19 Figure 1.3: Number of Liver Cancer Surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 1.3.4 LUNG CANCER Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-\u00ad\u2010related deaths in Canada, accounting for 27% of deaths in both males and females and an expected 5-\u00ad\u2010year survival rate of 17%.4 The lifetime probability of developing lung cancer is 1 in 12 for males and 1 in 14 for females.4 The annual incidence and mortality rates for males have significantly decreased from 2000 to 2009, while no significant changes have been observed over the same time for females.4 Surgical resection rates for lung cancer have increased over this same period, with in-\u00ad\u2010patient hospital records reporting a 24% increase in lung resections, from 2942 cases in 2004 to 3795 in 2012 (Figure 1.4). Surgery is the optimal curative option for lung cancer in early stage disease, with the anticipated five-\u00ad\u2010year survival for surgically resected stage I and II disease reported to be near 70%.22 Lung cancer surgery is performed to remove the diseased lung tissue. There are various procedure options depending on the stage, location, and type of cancer. Some of the common surgical procedures include: Pneumonectomy (removal of a whole lung); Lobectomy (removal of one or more lobes of a lung); and a Segmentectomy or Wedge resection (removal of part of a lobe within a lung). The surgery-\u00ad\u2010related mortality rates depend on the type of surgical technique applied, the extent of resection, and the associated complexities of the procedure. 692 745 796 784 883 981 985 1202 1265 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year P a g e | 20 Figure 1.4: Number of Lung Cancer Surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u20102012) 1.3.5 OVARIAN CANCER Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy.23 This cancer is relatively uncommon and, given the non-\u00ad\u2010specific nature of symptoms, is often diagnosed at a later stage of cancer.23,24 Early diagnosis often takes place incidentally during surgery for other indications.24 The lifetime probability of developing ovarian cancer in Canada is 1.4% (1 in 72), and the expected 5-\u00ad\u2010year survival rate is 42%.4 Although there has been a significant 1.1% reduction in the annual incidence rate from 2001-\u00ad\u20102010, the annual mortality rates have significantly increased by 2.2% over the same time period.4 From 2004 to 2012, a total of 16,949 gynecological procedures for primary ovarian and fallopian tube cancers were performed in Canada, representing a modest 12% increase over the 8 year period (Figure 1.5). Surgery plays a key role in the management of ovarian cancer, by determining the extent of cancer spread (stage) and influencing decisions on the use of chemotherapy in addition to the removal of the tumour itself (debulking).25 Due to the close interconnectedness of the female reproductive system, ovarian cancer surgeries are associated with an incredible heterogeneity of risk. For instance, surgery may involve the removal of one ovary (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), the uterus (hysterectomy), or pelvic and para aortic node dissection along with the removal of as much clinically evident tumour as possible (omentectomy).

Naturally, the degree of tumour resection will influence the morbidity and mortality rates after surgery.

Surgery is typically regarded as the preferred, and often definitive, treatment option for high risk cancers. The costs associated with cancer surgical procedures are significant and are associated with higher resource consumption due to the high complexity. An Ontario study looking at cancer data from 1997-\u00ad\u20102007 reported the mean post-\u00ad\u2010diagnosis costs of treatment for high-\u00ad\u2010risk, high resource intensive treatment for patients who survived beyond one year.26 The highest costs were reported for esophageal cancer ($50,620) from among the 21 cancers studied, which can be attributed to the need for an extended length of hospital stay and a greater need for post-\u00ad\u2010treatment follow-\u00ad\u2010up, resulting in higher physician service costs. The post-\u00ad\u2010 diagnosis costs for patients surviving beyond the first year for other high-\u00ad\u2010risk resource intensive cancers were: pancreas ($41,846); liver ($32,717); lung ($29,878); and ovarian cancer ($29,640). The costs included expenditures that are associated with inpatient hospital admissions, physician services, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, outpatient medications, same day surgery, diagnostic tests, long-\u00ad\u2010term care, continuing care and home care. These are imperfect costing numbers, as they were produced for wait times allocation discussions that included the consideration of supplementary health care services for several of these cancers. Although these costs do not represent the actual costs of surgery in Canada, this is the best available estimate on the cost associated with the treatment of 1814 1848 1877 1808 1825 1847 1949 1951 2030 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year P a g e | 22 high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource intensive surgical procedures. These costs are borne by the health care system, but also in part by the patient themselves, with the time required to travel to appointments, transportation costs and lost opportunity costs in addition to the fees not covered by provincial health plans. Box 1 describes a simplified demonstration of the travel and time costs associated with all hospital visits for the treatment of esophageal cancer. BOX 1: COSTING CASE STUDY CONSIDERING APPOINTMENTS AND COST OF PATIENT TRAVEL High-\u00ad\u2010risk, complex cancer surgery carries a significant economic burden to the Canadian health care system. While improving patient outcomes is ultimately the most important objective, any initiative that can reduce the burden of disease to the patient while also efficiently using limited health care resources is valuable to all stakeholders. In the next section, we will discuss the definition of regionalization of care, and present associated challenges and limitations of this approach. Patient Stories John lives in the centre of Niagara Falls, Ontario. He is currently receiving treatment for esophageal cancer at the Juravinski Cancer Centre (JCC) in Hamilton, ON for medical oncology/radiation oncology). He received surgical care at St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare Hamilton. The distance from his home to JCC is 71.3km (45 minutes), and 73.6km (50 min) to SJHH.

The definition of regionalization varies based on particular discipline of study. Furthermore, our best efforts could not find a consensus definition of regionalization of cancer surgical care in the literature ! Regionalization is more than a mere shift of patients from multiple small centres into one central facility, but is instead a planned process specifically targeted at improving quality and outcomes of care. Based on expert opinion, we define regionalization as: \u201cthe deliberate reorientation of cancer surgical procedures, based on explicit and planned processes and structures, with the intent of improving the quality of care\u201d ! A lack of consensus definition limits the ability to evaluate outcomes of \u2018regionalization\u2019 across various jurisdictions. If this is a strategy to improve quality of care, we need to know exact steps taken to implement it elsewhere. More often than not, volume is used as a surrogate measure to evaluate the impacts of \u2018regionalization\u2019 ! Volume alone is not a quality improvement measure, but it is an important component of a multifaceted organizational quality improvement approach that emphasizes specialized staff training, application of new knowledge, and benchmarking outcomes over time among other initiatives. 2.1 DEFINING REGIONALIZATION Regionalization is a broad, loosely defined, and context-\u00ad\u2010specific term that has been used in the disciplines of geography, globalization, sports, politics, health care policy and administration, business, and emergency planning, to mention a few. The definitions vary based on the specific discipline and intent of regionalization. For example, in emergency planning it is defined as, \u201cthe matching of medical resources to patient needs to maximize health benefits and outcomes while minimizing cost and use of resources over a specified geographic area\u201d.27 On a broader health care system level, it is often used to define the transference of responsibilities for health care planning, organization, and delivery of health care services to local regions.28 The recent development of Local Health Integration Networks and Regional Health Authorities are examples of forms of regionalization. The main goals of regionalization of health care services to local regions include cost P a g e | 24 containment, improving accountability and responsiveness for local health needs, and increasing public participation in health care decision-\u00ad\u2010making.28 A review of literature reporting the impacts of cancer surgery allocation to high volume centres showed that a consensus has yet to be reached for a consistent definition of regionalization. This term is often used interchangeably with \u2018centralization\u2019, \u2018consolidation\u2019 or \u2018designation\u2019 of cancer care. According to Raval, Bilimoria, & Talamonti (2010), \u201cRegionalization is a term used to describe shifting a set of procedures to certain hospitals (e.g. high-\u00ad\u2010volume) to improve surgical outcomes\u201d.29 This means that typically lower volume centres (often located in rural areas) are closed, directing the patients towards higher volume centres (typically in urban areas). Regionalization of surgical procedures can also contain cost, increase accountability and responsiveness to local needs, but it can also be directed at enhancing quality of care initiatives to improve outcomes of surgery. The lack of an available definition for regionalization in the literature leads to an inability to compare outcomes of regionalization across published studies. As with clinical data collection, it is impossible to consider differences between approaches when there is no standardized terminology. Processes that do not necessarily constitute regionalization are often classified as such, and these confound the study of regionalization outcomes. \u2018Passive Centralization\u2019 is such an example. Passive centralization is the \u2018unintentional\u2019 consolidation of surgical procedures to specific sites based on natural geography (e.g. a central service site for scattered rural remote areas), for cost containment, or availability of surgeons and staff in urban centres. This is in contrast to \u2018Active Centralization\u2019, which is a process that is actively undertaken with the intent to improve outcomes of surgery while ensuring safe, effective, and efficient patient care. Regionalization of high risk, high resource intensive cancer surgical procedures in Ontario is an example of \u2018active centralization\u2019. Given the challenges described above, a more suitable definition of regionalization was required in order to classify cancer treatment services as \u2018regionalized\u2019 to facilitate making comparisons across the provinces in Canada. Based on the field knowledge of our team members, review of the literature, and discussion with experts, we defined regionalization as: \u201cthe deliberate reorientation of cancer surgical procedures, based on explicit and planned processes and structures, with the intent of improving the quality of care\" P a g e | 25 Therefore, a mere increase in facility volume (centralization) does not necessarily equate to regionalization. Centralization is not regionalization. This definition closely matches with policies adopted by Cancer Care Ontario to regionalize high risk cancer surgical procedures. 2.2 HOW IS REGIONALIZATION EVALUATED? How we choose to evaluate the outcomes of regionalization of cancer surgery has implications on effective resource utilization and on patient quality of care. Evaluation usually takes place using either existing literature or retrospectively reviewed administrative databases. Both these approaches have certain trade-\u00ad\u2010offs based on the quality of the data and how it applies to each particular population. As noted above, existing literature may not be compatible due to varying definitions of regionalization. With no clear definition of the system under discussion, it may be more akin to comparing apples with oranges. Furthermore, the precision of the data may be unknown due to inconsistencies in data collection or other biases. Administrative datasets carry their own threats to validity and depend very much on the standardization of data definitions and collection procedures between centres. Regardless of how well the data is collected, the impact of changes in a complex, multi-\u00ad\u2010 dimensional system is difficult to predict. The statistical and economic models require extensive data to confidently predict the impact of changing certain factors on outcomes of interest. High quality data for such models on a national level, for all possible variables that may impact the performance of a system, is not always available and indeed, a large scale evaluation of regionalization has yet to be completed before this report. Therefore, considering all the optimization efforts presently being applied within a complex system, we are able to predict many but not all eventual repercussions of these manipulations. Sometimes the impact of changes to the delivery of services implemented at a system level is only evident later in time. The effects of early adoption of regionalization has been evaluated in the literature in an attempt to demonstrate the benefits of regionalization approaches. In addition to evaluating the outcomes of regionalization in monetary terms, evaluations can also focus on the improvement of patient outcomes, the successful implementation of high quality surgical procedures or adherence to evidence-\u00ad\u2010based guidelines and standards, among others. The majority of studies use administrative data to compare outcomes of high vs. low volume surgical centres. Volume as a Surrogate Measure Institutional and surgeon volume have been used to evaluate the impacts of regionalization on outcomes. While the literature tends to demonstrate a positive association between a higher volume of cases and better patient outcomes, there are other quality of care factors P a g e | 26 in high volume or tertiary care centres that also affect outcomes. Our literature review alludes to the fact that volume alone does not predict the reduction in mortality rates and improvements in overall survival that have been seen over time. Other potential factors include provider specialty, the use of multidisciplinary teams, specialized hospital infrastructure, improved surgical instrumentation, nursing staff experience and/or specialization, rescue of ill patients and better surgical techniques. One of the potential concerns regarding the use of volume as a predictor of outcomes is that it may unfairly discriminate against low-\u00ad\u2010volume providers with favourable outcomes.170 In the interest of improving the quality of care, it may seem reasonable to apply benchmarking techniques to highlight centres that are more successful at selected outcomes. There are concerns regarding the low statistical power associated with small sample size in individual low volume providers that may hinder a reliable comparison with either their high volume counterparts or against a national benchmark, but this approach may prove to be useful. Even with these considerations, the benefits of using volume outweigh its limitations. Volume is an easily measurable and frequently reported variable, and is clearly associated with improved surgical outcomes.29,30 It is easily acquired from administrative data for hospitals and for surgeons. Although the debate remains unsettled on a direct causal relationship between volume and outcomes, better outcomes are still achieved for patients if surgeries are performed at high volume sites.10 Therefore, volume remains the best available indictor to evaluate surgical quality in the absence of other viable alternatives.29 While understanding its limits, volume will be used as a surrogate measure for evaluating outcomes of cancer surgical procedures in this report. 2.3 CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH REGIONALIZATION While regionalization of cancer surgical care has a potential for quality improvement that may serve the interests of patients, providers, and the payers, it is not without criticism. Any shifts in the structure of care directly or indirectly impacts the users, providers, and funders of healthcare services. Table 2.3.1 summaries some of the speculated risks and benefits of regionalization policies. P a g e | 27 TABLE 2.3.1: BENEFITS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF REGIONALIZATION PROS CONS Improved patient-\u00ad\u2010based outcomes \u2022 Lower mortality rates; shorter length of stay Out-\u00ad\u2010of-\u00ad\u2010pocket patient cost and burden of travel32 (also depicted in Box 1) Allows for dissemination of guidelines and standards Loss of local pre-\u00ad\u2010and post-\u00ad\u2010cancer surgical services Enables capturing of reliable data for evaluating quality of surgical care Loss of surgical expertise at local hospitals31 Provides opportunities for partnering with multidisciplinary staff Longer surgical wait times in high volume centres Encourages collaboration for research and innovation to improve processes of care Potential lack of access to informal care/lack of support for families and caregivers Potential 24/7 access to specialty care at designated centres Providers\u2019 resistance among providers towards shift in established care processes Promotes benchmarking and other surgical quality improvement measures Significant challenges to implementing regionalization if hospital\u2019s revenue is directly tied to the number of treated patients119 In short, the regionalization of surgical care often presents patients and caregivers with a dilemma, requiring them to choose between quality care and accessible care. The concerns of providers revolve around resistance towards any shifts away from existing practices, financial implications, and disagreements regarding the use of volume as a quality metric. The system-\u00ad\u2010level concerns focus on the practical challenges faced by policy makers and healthcare planners to devise comprehensive strategies and guidelines that adequately address stakeholder concerns, geographic specificities, and healthcare demands. The successful implementation of regionalization policies and standards may require provincial cancer agencies to provide strategic direction and leadership for surgical care. The Ontario experience of the regionalization of thoracic surgeries provides an example of strategies that have been adopted to assist with the implementation of regionalization policies. Although an evaluation of risk-\u00ad\u2010adjusted outcomes has yet to be conducted, the success of this policy has been reported by the resultant increase in surgical volume at designated centres.119 In Ontario, other strategies that have been utilized to promote the implementation of regionalization include: 1) Extensive discussions between concerned healthcare planners (cancer agency senior leadership), administrators (Chief Executives of hospitals), and thoracic surgeons; and 2) Use of additional funds to encourage compliance of hospitals with surgical standards and to lower wait times by increasing number of procedures.119 Regionalization policies that adequately address the stakeholders\u2019 concerns can improve the success of quality improvement initiatives by ensuring coordination, collaboration, and client-\u00ad\u2010satisfaction. P a g e | 28 3.0: LITERATURE REVIEW: EXISTING EVIDENCE ON REGIONALIZATION CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS ! Overall, compelling evidence from numerous studies contrasting provider (hospital, surgeon) volume, or provider specialty and improved outcomes (in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay, or overall survival) has been published in last two decades. ! The bulk of the literature and pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian evidence would support the regionalization of lung, esophageal, liver, pancreatic and ovarian cancers on hard objective measures such as mortality and length of stay. ! The relative significance of facility volume, surgeon volume, surgeon specialty, or institution specialization on such outcomes is still undetermined. o The extent of conflicting literature can be confusing for patients and families seeking information to aid decision-\u00ad\u2010making about where and with whom to seek cancer surgical care. This can impact their willingness to travel farther distances for care. ! Fundamentally, it is not reasonable or practical to identify a single number threshold that defines a high volume centre. ! There is a lack of studies that consider more difficult to measure outcomes such as adherence to best practice standards, complication rates, survival and long term results, largely because these outcomes are not reliably captured in administrative datasets, if at all, and there has only been recent interest in the evaluation of such endpoints within the academic community o Survival and complications affect all patients undergoing the surgery and thus would offer a significantly better power to evaluate the centralization of surgical cancer services. 3.1 LITERATURE REVIEW AND METHODOLOGY In this section, a brief summary of existing literature on the modifiable, provider-\u00ad\u2010related (facility, surgeon) factors that can impact outcomes of care is presented. Any evidence on the impact of regionalization at the patient or system-\u00ad\u2010level will be discussed in this section. In total, 110 relevant studies were abstracted from the literature (see Appendix 1 for detailed search criteria and summary tables). The studies varied based on population size, country of origin, and reported outcomes. Although a formal methodological quality assessment was not conducted, only population-\u00ad\u2010based studies were included in order to avoid biases in single institution studies, such as those related to socioeconomic status, P a g e | 29 race, or co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities. The selection of population-\u00ad\u2010based studies allows for a theoretically greater generalizability of conclusions to an overall population leading to the identification of factors that can lead to population-\u00ad\u2010wide improvements in care. Dimick et al. supported the claim that data from single-\u00ad\u2010centre studies is not a good representation of national trends in rates of procedures performed over time.20 The findings of such studies may not be generalizable to a broader range of institutional settings given the differences in standards and procedures used to provide care. Figure 3.1 demonstrates the flow of the completed literature search and review process. 3.2 VOLUME-\u00ad\u2010OUTCOME ASSOCIATION The positive impact of facility/surgeon volume on post-\u00ad\u2010operative outcomes for various cancer types has been demonstrated extensively in the literature. The results of these studies have prompted various researchers and policy makers to urge for the regionalization of complex surgical procedures.21,34-\u00ad\u201039 It is important to note that there was a disparity in the number of studies reporting on volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome association depending on the cancer type, with liver and ovarian cancer represented by fewer analyses than the other cancers. In-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was the most reported outcome while reporting of other outcomes such as length of stay, morbidity, and overall survival was inconsistent or incomplete. Only significant associations after adjusting for patient case-\u00ad\u2010mix are reported over the course of this review document. It is also important to note that the type of procedure being evaluated in a study was identified and reported. The procedures differ in complexity and associated mortality and morbidity rates, hence, the reports that fail to account for the types of resection could potentially bias the results. In spite of inherent differences in surgical approaches and the complexity of procedures, numerous studies reported improved clinical outcomes, even if not statistically significant, at high volume centres for esophagus, lung and pancreatic cancers (see Appendix 1). These associations held true after adjusting for patient case-\u00ad\u2010mix for the majority of studies (Table 3.1). The strongest evidence for a reduction in mortality rates with increasing volume was reported for esophageal cancer surgery. A large body of evidence, including systematic reviews and meta-\u00ad\u2010analyses, support referral to regional, specialized, high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospitals for esophageal surgical procedures.18,40 The operative mortality reported in these studies varied widely possibly due to the heterogeneity of the study populations or differences in study periods.18,19 Relatively fewer studies reported on length of stay and overall survival, however, the length of period over which these survival rates were calculated was not clearly stated.41-\u00ad\u201047 P a g e | 30 The volume\u2013outcome relationship for hepatic cancer surgical procedures has rarely been explored.48 The most commonly reported outcomes include mortality and length of stay.18-\u00ad\u2010 21,37,38 While an overall downward trend in mortality and morbidity rates post-\u00ad\u2010 hepatobiliary surgical procedures was observed in general, a significantly larger decrease in mortality and length of stay at high volume centres was reported.20,38,49-\u00ad\u201054 In a pan-\u00ad\u2010 Canadian study, the increase in number of procedures being performed in high volume centres was associated with a reduction in the rates of perioperative mortality (from 5.8% 256 full-\u00ad\u2010text articles assessed for eligibility Screening Included Eligibility Identification 5923 records identified through database searching 24 additional records identified through hand searching references 1751 records after duplicates removed 269 titles included 1661 records excluded after title screening 30 full-\u00ad\u2010text articles excluded Single centre study Data collected before 1990 Published before 2000 No Data Available 110 studies included in qualitative synthesis 13 records excluded after abstract screening 39 Esophagus 26 Lung 21 Pancreas 12 Liver 12 Ovarian Figure 3.1: Flow diagram depicting literature screening process P a g e | 31 in 1995\u20131996 to 4.2% in 2003\u20132004).19 The mean length of stay decreased from 12.1 to 13.2 days over the course of 1995 to 2004.19 The most inconsistent and conflicting evidence in favour of centralizing surgical cancer services was found for ovarian cancer surgery. The absolute reduction in mortality for ovarian cancer after regionalization was less than that shown for lung, esophagus, and pancreatic cancer procedures.55 In-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was seldom discussed as an outcome in these studies. This may reflect the proportionally lower mortality in these cases and as such, discrepancies are more difficult to detect. While treatment in tertiary, high volume centres was shown to be an independent prognostic factor predicting better prognosis and survival of ovarian cancer, staging of disease and complete cytoreduction also predicted outcomes of surgery.23,56,57 In ovarian cancer surgery, hospital volume was reported to be associated with other metrics of quality care including lower re-\u00ad\u2010operation rate, provision of guideline-\u00ad\u2010based care, better staging for early-\u00ad\u2010stage disease, more extended cytoreduction for advanced-\u00ad\u2010stage cancers, performance of lymphadenectomy, receipt of post-\u00ad\u2010operative chemotherapy, fewer prolonged hospitalizations, and lower ostomy (complication) rates.55,58,59 The adherence to guidelines is particularly pertinent as it is associated with better outcomes and the literature reports that low volume hospitals and surgeons are less likely to adhere to the guidelines.60 Across all cancer types studied, post-\u00ad\u2010operative complications are a major cause of in-\u00ad\u2010 hospital mortality.16 An improvement in rates of complications at high volume centres were reported in a few studies.12,13,16,58,59,61-\u00ad\u201064 Regrettably, there were no single standard criteria for classification of post-\u00ad\u2010operative complications for any of the cancer types, so it was difficult to assess reported complication severity. Wright et al. found that the high volume centres for ovarian cancer had higher adjusted complication rate, yet, showed better survival.59 Further analysis concluded that patients experiencing a complication at low-\u00ad\u2010volume hospitals were nearly 50% more likely to die as compared to those in high volume centres. Ghaferi et al. also found similar complication rates for gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, and esophagectomy at different hospital volumes, however, a higher failure to rescue patients from adverse events was associated with low volume hospitals.66 Therefore, the ability of an institution to manage complications, even if they do not reduce the overall rate of complications themselves, seems to predict mortality. Contrarians of volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome associations argue that it is incorrect to attribute positive outcomes to high-\u00ad\u2010volumes alone, a position that is supported by some literature. The volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome relationship could be a result of various complex interactions between factors that may also lead to improved outcomes. For example, the benefits of restricting complex high risk procedures to high-\u00ad\u2010volume centres could be a result of superior surgical outcomes at a particular site leading to more referrals, which could increase procedural volume at that site.11 The improvement in outcomes could also be attributed to better P a g e | 32 patient selection, advanced operative techniques, better perioperative and post-\u00ad\u2010operative management of cases, and specialized surgeon training.50,68 Surgeon Volume and Outcomes The association between surgeon volume and mortality, morbidity, or length of stay was less frequently reported in the literature. Only twelve studies included in this review reported the impacts of high surgeon volume on patient specific outcomes.16,23,25,48,55,58,69-\u00ad\u201073 Although reduction in mortality rate for pancreatic,16,72,73 esophageal,41,69,74,75 lung,69-\u00ad\u201071and ovarian55 cancer was reported with increased surgeon volume, arguments remain unsettled for the benefits of consolidating surgeries to high volume surgeons vs. high volume centres. While studying the impacts of volume on short term morbidity, 30-\u00ad\u2010day mortality, and long term prognosis, Sundelof et al. reported a high level of association between surgeon and hospital volume, hence the reported outcomes were similar for both the variables.76 Uncertain results were found in studies that tried to find the relative significance of one variable or the other. For instance, Derogar et al. compared the relative significance of hospital and surgeon volumes on short term and long term risk of mortality.45 After adjusting for the effect of hospital volume and surgeon clustering effect, short term mortality risk was not significantly associated with surgeon volume. The authors asserted the conclusion that factors related to hospitals (i.e. intensive care units) but not volume, impacted short term mortality risk. However, the risk of long-\u00ad\u2010term mortality was significantly associated with surgeon volume, even after adjusting for hospital volume and surgeon clustering effect.45 3.3 PROVIDER SPECIALTY AND OUTCOMES Surgeon speciality was not studied in the majority of the literature associated with pancreatic, hepatobiliary, lung, or esophageal cancers, with the exception of ovarian cancer. In lung cancer regionalization literature, the few studies that investigated provider speciality reported non-\u00ad\u2010significant differences between rates of mortality, length of stay, and overall survival when comparing patients outcomes of surgeries performed by thoracic vs. general surgeons.78-\u00ad\u201080 The outcomes were consistent across pneumonectomy, lobectomy, and general lung resections. However, the number of lung cancer-\u00ad\u2010specific studies is too small for any conclusive conclusions to be made. In gynecological surgery, the extensive literature has reported that initial surgical care by a gynecological oncologist has been found to be associated with a higher likelihood of comprehensive surgical staging, optimal primary cytoreductive surgery, adherence to recommended guidelines, and superior long-\u00ad\u2010term outcomes.81-\u00ad\u201086 The advantages associated with specialized surgeons also appears to extend to advantages to using specialized hospitals to perform ovarian cancer surgery. Vernooij et al. reported that specialized hospitals are shown to have significantly lower mortality and better overall P a g e | 33 survival compared to general hospitals.23 In addition, the level of specialization of the hospital was positively associated with adequately staged, optimally debulked patients.23 The interplay between surgeon-\u00ad\u2010specific factors and hospital-\u00ad\u2010related factors and outcomes was demonstrated in some studies as well. For example, low volume surgeons at high volume centres were reported to have comparable outcomes for hepatic procedures as those of high volume surgeons at the same centre.31,87 Similarly, gynecological oncologists working in cancer centres were reported to be twice as likely to attain optimal cytoreduction, when compared to general gynaecologists.88 TABLE 3.1.

The impacts of regionalization on surgical procedures have been studied across various settings and in different jurisdictions. P a g e | 34 The literature appears to report a positive association between regionalization and morbidity and/or mortality across all five cancer types, even if it is a weak association. Across many jurisdictions, the literature consistently reports improvements in survival (2-\u00ad\u2010 5 year), and both post-\u00ad\u2010operative and 30-\u00ad\u2010day mortality and morbidity rates following the implementation of regionalization policies for esophagectomy.11,40,89-\u00ad\u201091 This observation appears to hold true with pancreatic surgery, which has seen a gradual increase in the number of resections performed in high volume centres.12,13 One study in the Netherlands showed a significant reduction in rates of mortality (24% to 2.6%), and morbidity (82% to 38%) after pancreatic cancer surgery while comparing pre-\u00ad\u2010and-\u00ad\u2010post regionalization outcomes.13 Similarly, the proportion of ovarian cancer patients undergoing ovarian resections in high volume centres, and the proportion of procedures being done by high volume surgeons is reported to have increased over the last 14 years.55 Regardless of cancer site, significant reductions in mortality rates were reported in studies comparing results of providing care in designated centres pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010centralization.56,92 A significant regionalization of hepatic cancer surgical procedures over the last decade to high-\u00ad\u2010volume centres has also been reported in the US and Canada, with reported significant improvements in mortality rates.19,39 This consistent reporting of outcomes improvement across all studied disease sites leads one to believe that the regionalization of surgical cancer services offers positive benefits to patients. 3.5 OPTIMUM VOLUME THRESHOLD One of the main objectives of this systematic review was to provide an evidence-\u00ad\u2010based volume threshold for each cancer type at which optimum outcomes could be achieved. Early results of the regionalization of pancreatic, esophageal, and liver cancer procedures using different volume thresholds and standards has been reported in the literature. The extent of the literature studying volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome associations for esophagectomy allowed pooling of data and controlling for potential confounding variables (e.g. age, sex, co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities) for meta-\u00ad\u2010analyses. While positive results have been reported from the meta-\u00ad\u2010analysis of data, it has been reported that it is necessary to perform at least 20 esophagectomies per year to reduce mortality to less than 5%.91 This observation appears to be supported by other literature reporting higher and widely varying mortality rates for less than 20 esophagectomy cases per year.93 For pancreatic cancer, a volume threshold of 10 pancreatic procedures per year was proposed.94 Lung cancer presents a curious case in that although the annual case volume for lung cancer is larger than that of pancreatic or esophageal cancer, there is relatively limited evidence to support volume standards in lung cancer surgery95 and there were no common criteria across studies to indicate potential volume cut-\u00ad\u2010offs. Lastly, according to the ovarian cancer guidelines disseminated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the hospitals are classified as high-\u00ad\u2010 volume if they perform >20 cases of ovarian cancer per year, and the surgeons are P a g e | 35 classified as high-\u00ad\u2010volume if they perform >10 cases of ovarian cancer per year.60 The volume cut-\u00ad\u2010off for liver cancer surgeries was not reported in the included literature. Relatively small number of studies limits our ability to provide such comparisons as well. The review of literature demonstrated disagreements in the use of volume thresholds to classify institutions or surgeons as high or low volume. Studies comparing the annual volume of procedures often had overlapping volume thresholds defining high vs. low volume categories.96 This further complicates the process of comparing studies to identify volume thresholds in order to achieve best possible patient outcomes. In addition, it has been suggested that the open-\u00ad\u2010ended volume thresholds in the highest volume categories may underestimate the actual mean number of surgeries performed per year.97 Therefore, the outcomes demonstrated in high volume categories may be a result of actual (higher) mean volume rather than the threshold used for the high-\u00ad\u2010volume category. This threshold is expected to vary for each of the cancer types given the varying levels of complexities associated with each of the surgical procedures. Fundamentally, it is not reasonable to identify a single number threshold that defines a high volume centre. Practically speaking, the volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome effect is demonstrated even with institutions with the highest case volume, although it eventually does not make a clinically significant difference and would be impractical to implement a defined value. As such, the volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome effect is one that should be utilized in health care planning, but not with such granularity as to demand a threshold. 3.6 LIMITATIONS The association between volume consolidation and positive outcomes is not without criticism. In general, the literature is lacking consensus on the relative importance of facility vs. surgeon volume at affecting the outcomes of surgery. The heterogeneity in patient co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities, surgeon specialty, facility size, and volume thresholds limits the ability to draw valid comparisons between different studies while varying study designs, non-\u00ad\u2010consensus-\u00ad\u2010based volume thresholds, conflicting findings, small sample sizes, low quality of data sources, heterogeneity of comparison groups, and definitions of outcome measures limits the ability to provide conclusive results.29 The small number of available studies and heterogeneity of data limits the ability to conduct a meta-\u00ad\u2010analysis for most cancer surgeries.95 Finally, long term survival assessment is a highly patient-\u00ad\u2010important metric, but it is also dependent on tumour stage, which is not always included in the analysis.89 Even though the majority of studies reported improved outcomes in high volume centres or for high volume surgeons relative to low volume hospitals and surgeons, the difference was not always statistically and/or clinically significant. This limits the ability to draw statistically sound conclusions on whether the high volume centres and surgeons actually P a g e | 36 show improved outcomes. In addition, the quality of data used to study volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome association has inherent limitations. Most of the studies, if not all, used administrative data to study the volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome association. Such data is collected for administrative and billing purposes and thus direct cause-\u00ad\u2010and-\u00ad\u2010effect relationships cannot be determined with confidence from the analysis of such data given the possible differences in data coding practices. Lastly, the review found that comprehensive reporting of cancer surgery systems in place for the delivery of high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource intensive surgical procedures in each Canadian province or territory is largely non-\u00ad\u2010existent. While steps to improve quality of surgical care have been initiated in other provinces, Ontario is the only province with formal steps and published guidelines for regionalization of certain high-\u00ad\u2010risk procedures (pancreatic, hepatic, esophagus, lung, gynecological cancers),17,60,98 although a few other provinces have taken steps to actively regionalize some cancer site procedures. In addition, there is little research into whether these efforts have helped or hindered the quality of cancer care from a system-\u00ad\u2010level perspective. Further research is required to compare system-\u00ad\u2010level outcomes such as administration costs prior to regionalization activities with the post-\u00ad\u2010regionalization period in order to adjudicate the overall benefit. 3.7 CONCLUSION The success to which consolidation of care to high volume centres or surgeons improves patient outcomes has yet to be fully studied, although it appears that the potential to greatly impact patient survival, length of stay and morbidity is possible, if implemented in ideal situations. The conflicting evidence of the relative significance of provider (surgeon, hospital) volume, surgeon specialty or hospital designation alludes to the fact that improvements in outcomes are more likely to be caused by the cumulative effect of practitioner training and multidisciplinary collaboration, an adequate number of practitioners in one centre, balanced case volume and complexity, readily available consultation services, specialized nursing and anesthesia services, and adequate radiology and pathologic support. Volume is not a stand-\u00ad\u2010alone factor explaining all improvements in outcomes. The presence of multidisciplinary teams, well-\u00ad\u2010trained staff, and the resources available to efficiently recognize and treat post-\u00ad\u2010operative complications are all factors associated with high volume centres that cumulatively improve outcomes of care. The best possible surgical outcome may be achieved through the utilization of expert surgeons in high volume centres equipped with cutting edge technology, perioperative institutional standards and supported by specialized multidisciplinary teams. The experience of surgical team, their ability to rescue complicated cases, and availability of multiple surgeons for cooperation and planning of complex cases may result in better outcomes of care. P a g e | 37 A majority of the literature points towards improved, even if not statistically significant, outcomes associated with high volume hospitals. Evidence regarding the impact of high surgeon volume is comparatively less clear. Skepticism remains in the use of findings from the literature to provide an evidence-\u00ad\u2010based discussion on the impact of regionalization on surgical outcomes. The limited strength of evidence and heterogeneity of results should be accounted for in identifying volume thresholds. Fundamentally, the volume of cases completed at a given centre is not an all-\u00ad\u2010encompassing metric. It is not just the simple sum of all the components in care, as those components are inextricably linked and overlapping. This is what makes dissecting down further impossible and explains the heterogeneity of results. It is, however, the most robust statistic available to decision makers and as such, is useful in measuring and evaluating institutions. It is potentially best utilized as a starting point for the development of a cancer surgery quality improvement strategy and must be a key contributor to that conversation. P a g e | 38 4.0: ANALYSIS OF PAN-\u00ad\u2010CANADIAN DATA CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS ! Hospital volume was a significant predictor of mortality for four of the five cancer surgeries, even in the presence of surgeon volume and specialty. Surgeon volume significantly predicted both outcomes only for liver cancer, while controlling for the influence of hospital related factors. However, it is necessary to note that these three variables are not mutually exclusive. A list of factors significantly associated with in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality and length of stay in adjusted analysis is presented in Table 4.0a. ! Ontario, being the most populous province, showed the biggest reduction in number of hospitals performing these surgeries for lung, liver, pancreatic and esophagus cancers. Differences exist in provinces in crude in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rates and length of stay. The trends vary based on specific cancer surgery of interest, with no one province demonstrating the best outcomes across all cancer types ! Travel times slightly increased between the beginning and the end of the study period almost irrespective of patient location. As surgical centres closed, whether as a result of passive or active regionalization activities, the catchment areas of the remaining centres widened, revealing a longer travel time for all but the most urban centres. Across all cancer sites, the proportion of patients who had to travel more than one hour to access care increased as the number of centres that provide surgical cancer services decreased. This data confirms that the regionalization of some services to high volume, central locations occurs at the expense of patient travel time. ! There were differences between the provinces in age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted resection rates per capita. However, a clear association between in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rates and associated resection rates could not reliably be established. Limitations: ! As can be expected based on the population distribution of Canada, there is a large variation in the number of surgical cases completed per province, even temporally during the study period. This limits the ability to perform year-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010year comparisons on mortality rates, so a 9-\u00ad\u2010year (2004-\u00ad\u2010 2012) average mortality rate is reported throughout this section to facilitate comparisons and discussion. ! The small annual surgical volume in less populous provinces limited our ability to reliably determine inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial differences in outcomes of interest in regression and survival analysis. P a g e | 39 ! It should be noted that the surgeon specialty could not be independently verified, which limits our ability to draw accurate comparisons between specialist and general surgeons in the outcomes of interest. ! The inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial differences could not reliably be determined given the small surgical case volume in certain jurisdictions.

The primary objective of our analyses were: 1) To provide quantitative evidence on the impacts of regionalization activities on patient outcomes established through risk-\u00ad\u2010adjusted volume-\u00ad\u2010 outcome associations for the five surgical procedures of interest; 2) To demonstrate the disparities across the provinces in regards to patient-\u00ad\u2010based outcomes of interest; and 3) To present the temporal and geographic trends in the distribution of surgical care across the provinces, and associated burden of travel. The main outcomes of interest included in-\u00ad\u2010 hospital mortality, 30-\u00ad\u2010day length of stay, per capita resection rates, and travel distances. In addition, the potential years of lives and the number of hospitalization days saved through consolidation to high volume centres are also presented in this section. A detailed description of data selection and statistical analysis methodologies are described in Appendix 2 and 3. The national-\u00ad\u2010level data, excluding Quebec, was extracted from the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), which contains hospital records for in-\u00ad\u2010patient admissions. Except for liver cancer, only cases with primary cancers and associated surgical procedure(s) over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period (2004-\u00ad\u20102012) were included in this analysis (See Appendix 2 for detailed inclusion criteria). Surgeon volume, surgeon specialty, and hospital volume were used as proxy measures to predict the impacts of regionalization of these complex high-\u00ad\u2010risk cancer surgeries to higher volume centres. Mortality and length of hospital stay were selected as outcomes of interest due to the suitability of the datasets as well as the fact that these two outcomes are considered highly important to both patients and health care planners. Multivariate regression and survival analyses were performed to assess the adjusted risk of mortality and length of stay associated with patient and provider specific variables of interest. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial mapping techniques were employed to investigate how regionalization of surgical cancer services has evolved over the study period and how this impacts patient travel times to access surgical care (Appendix 3). Lastly, age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates were used to determine the differences between provinces in proportion of resected tumours. The decision to undertake surgical approach depends on cancer-\u00ad\u2010specific factors (i.e. stage, extent of tumour spread), patient-\u00ad\u2010related factors (age, comorbidities, or choice of treatment); however, studies have shown resection rate to be associated with provider\u2019s decision to adopt surgical treatment even in high-\u00ad\u2010risk cases.162,163 It has been speculated that any increase in resection rates could lead to improved survival.166 Since improvements in resection rates represent an opportunity to improve survival, we present the differences in resection rates across provinces for the cancer surgeries of interest. If higher resection rates do affect survival, any inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial differences in the proportion of resected cancer tumours could potentially indicate P a g e | 41 disparities in the equitable access to high quality care. The age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates were calculated using the 1991 Canadian population structure as a reference population. Provincial population distributions in 2005 and 2011 were standardized and multiplied by 3 to obtain the denominator as person-\u00ad\u2010years, as opposed to the annual rate(s). The numerator for resection rate calculation was the sum of surgeries taking place over in the first and last 3 years of the study cohort. The age-\u00ad\u2010standardized incidence rates for esophageal, pancreatic, and lung cancers in 2010 are reported for comparison purposes. The incidence rates for ovarian and liver cancers could not be reported as all the diagnosis codes for ovarian cancer(s) used in this study and the incidence of secondary liver tumours were not available from Statistics Canada. 4.2 ANALYSIS RESULTS Overall, differences were observed in the total number of surgeries performed for each cancer (Table 4.1). Moreover, inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial differences in the proportion of surgeries for a particular cancer type were also apparent, related mainly to the variance in population density across Canada. A majority (49-\u00ad\u201052%) of procedures for all five cancers were performed in Ontario, with British Columbia and Alberta constituting the second and third highest proportions, respectively. This section will summarize the state of surgical care for each cancer type in Canada, and the results of volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome association. See Appendix 4 and 5 for detailed statistical analyses.

A total of 2810 relevant esophageal cancer resections were performed in 71 hospitals across Canada (2004-\u00ad\u20102012). The number of institutions performing esophageal resections declined over time, mainly led by a 50% reduction across Ontario (Figure 4.2.1a). However, the annual number of esophageal resections stayed relatively stable during this time period, increasing only 6.4% (Table 4.2.1a). Figure 4.2.1b depicts annual provincial volumes and changes in the number of procedures over time, with case volumes only minimally increasing over the study period and differing only slightly between the provinces. Due to the small annual case load, the median hospital volume was 12 esophagectomies per year (Interquartile range [IQR]=13), and median annual surgeon volume was 5 esophagectomies [IQR=6]. Although the proportion of specialist surgeons varied between provinces and over the years, thoracic surgeons performed nearly 2/3rd of all esophagectomies across Canada between 2004 and 2012. The mean patient age was 64.1 (Standard Deviation [SD]=10.2) years, with a majority (79%) being male.

However, the smaller sample size in Newfoundland may jeopardize the validity of these results. On the contrary, a reduction in median kilometers travelled by the patients was observed in Manitoba and British Columbia over the two time periods (24 and 5 kilometers, respectively). As expected, the provinces with the highest increase in median number of kilometers also depicted a reduction in proportion of patients within one hour travel distance (Table 4.2.1b). In Ontario an additional 6 (median) kilometers were added to the patient journey as a result of a 50% reduction in number of facilities. Between fiscal years 2010-\u00ad\u201012, 61% of patients were still within a one hour travel distance from the surgical centre, down 3% from 2004-\u00ad\u201006. It should be noted that the provinces differ in population densities, hence, the relative proportions of populations within 1 hour of travel distance is expected to vary. The relative differences across different disease sites within the same province might serve as a better indicator of disparities in structures of care for difference surgical procedures. Intra-\u00ad\u2010 provincial differences in patient travel times for different surgeries are presented in Chapter 5.

Overall, the minimal variations in age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates were observed between provinces in 2010-\u00ad\u201012 fiscal years. The rates varied from 3.9 (per 100,000) in Saskatchewan to 1.7 (per 100,000) in Newfoundland in the 2010-\u00ad\u201012 fiscal years. Apart from Manitoba (2.7 per 100,000), the resection rates for other provinces were higher than 3 resections per capita. However, the rates varied over the year within the provinces. For instance, an increase in resection rates occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan between the first three-\u00ad\u2010year interval (2004-\u00ad\u2010 2006) and the later interval in 2010-\u00ad\u20102012. The rates of esophageal resection stayed stable in Ontario over the two time periods. Newfoundland had the lowest rates of 2 resections per capita among all the provinces. The provincial resection rates observed over time do not depict a clear association with relative 9-\u00ad\u2010year mortality rates reported in Figure 4.2.1g. However, the resections rates were lower than the incidence rates for Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. The implications of such differences on survival rates and quality of care need further investigation. Figure 4.2.1e: Age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates per 100,000 populations for esophageal cancer surgeries In-\u00ad\u2010Hospital Mortality The overall in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality for esophagectomy cases over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period was 5.6%, declining from 6.3% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2012 (Figure 4.2.1f). As expected, there were differences between provinces in the 9-\u00ad\u2010year average mortality rate, even after adjusting for age differences among the provinces (Figure 4.2.1g).

It must be noted that these age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates do not consider the number of patients who opt-\u00ad\u2010out of surgery, are more highly staged and thus ineligible for resection, or experience a greater number of co-\u00ad\u2010 morbidities. More significantly, the rates cannot consider the effect of even a small number of deaths in a small sample, as would be the case with Newfoundland. These factors may influence the reported mortality rates in esophageal cancer, but also in the other cancer sites investigated in this report. Figure 4.2.1f: Annual age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates for esophageal cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) Figure 4.2.1g: Age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates for esophageal cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Mortality Rate (%) Fiscal Year 3.95% 4.10% 11% 6.61% 2.72% 2.75% 6.27% 6.41% 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 AB BC MB NB NL NS ON SK Mortality Rate (%) Province P a g e | 49 In univariate analysis, hospital volume, surgeon volume and specialty were all associated with differences in the in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rate. Figure 4.2.1h, demonstrates a linear reduction in observed mortality rates with an increase in annual hospital volume. In multivariate analysis, hospital volume was significantly associated with reduction is risk of mortality, after controlling for the effect of patient-\u00ad\u2010related covariates, surgeon volume, specialty, and significant interactions between provider volume and specialty (see Appendix 4). A significant effect of hospital volume on risk of mortality persisted after controlling for provincial variations in the model. Among the non-\u00ad\u2010modifiable factors, patient age and co-\u00ad\u2010morbidity score significantly predicted the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality. Procedural type (open vs. minimally invasive resection), and patient gender did not significantly predict the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality. Surgeon volume or specialty was insignificantly associated with mortality risk after controlling for hospital volume and random differences between hospitals. A strong interaction between provider volume and surgeon specialty was also observed, further highlighting the complexity of volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome association. It also supports the premise that improved outcomes at high volume hospitals could be the result of a combination of factors including hospital volume, surgeon volume and surgeon specialty. Factors including staff training and access to advanced treatment measures could not be accounted for in present data. There were no differences in risk of mortality between Ontario and rest of Canada after controlling for other factors in the model. Figure 4.2.1h: Annual hospital volume and mortality rate for esophageal cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Mortality Rate (%) 0 10 20 30 40 Annual Hospital Volume P a g e | 50 ! The impact of hospital volume on the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was most pronounced for esophageal cancer. In a simplistic model, every 10 case increase in hospital volume predicted a risk reduction of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality of 21%. ! Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, theoretically a total of 30 additional lives could have been saved after esophageal cancer surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012). Length of Stay The overall median length of stay for esophageal surgeries over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period was 13 days [IQR=12]. In spite of slight variations over the years, the median length of stay has been reduced by one day across Canada from 2004 to 2012 (Table 4.2.1b). Similarly, provincial differences were apparent as well, with New Brunswick and Saskatchewan having the highest median length of stay at 16 days and British Columbia with the lowest at 12 days (Table 4.2.1c). Without accounting for any other differences between provinces affecting length of stay, this difference implies a costly additional 476 hospital days for Saskatchewan, and 336 for New Brunswick relative to British Columbia over this time period. While differences in discharge rate at different time period are evident for open procedures, the relative differences between low and high volume hospitals at each period appear constant (Figure 4.2.1i). TABLE 4.2.1B: MEDIAN LENGTH OF STAY IN CANADA, BY YEAR In survival analysis, patient age, co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities, open procedures, and male patients were significantly associated with a risk of longer length of stay. The survival model is presented in Appendix 5. Surgeon specialty was not significantly associated with length of stay. Higher surgeon volume was significantly associated with a shorter length of stay for those discharged alive, with this association marginally significant for hospital volume. There were also no differences between Ontario and rest of Canada on length of hospital stay.

Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, a median of 407 hospital days could potentially have been saved annually across Canada for esophageal cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012). Figure 4.2.1i: Predicted discharge rate for open esophagectomy in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 4.2.2 PANCREATIC CANCER SURGERY In the period spanning 2004 to 2012, 3990 relevant pancreatic resections were performed in 92 hospitals across Canada. The mean age of patients was 63.7 (SD=11.6) years, with 51% of patients being male. The median hospital volume was 23 resections per year [IQR=30], and median surgeon volume was 8 resections annually [IQR=8]. The annual number of pancreatic cancer surgeries increased 77%, from 337 procedures in 2004 to 599 in 2012 (Figure 4.2.2a). An increase in number of procedures was observed in Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia (Table 4.2.2a). At the same time, the number of institutions performing surgeries decreased from 56 in 2004 to 39 in 2012 (Figure 4.2.2b). It is interesting to note that a 50% reduction in the number of institutions performing pancreatic resections was observed in Ontario and New Brunswick (26 to 13; and 6 to 3 respectively], potentially demonstrating active regionalization efforts in Ontario and the apparent consolidation of surgical cancer services in New Brunswick. 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 1 Discharge Rate (%) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Annual Hospital Volume 10 Days 13 Days 21 Days P a g e | 52 TABLE 4.2.2A: NUMBER OF PANCREATIC CANCER SURGERIES IN CANADA, BY YEAR AND PROVINCE (2004-\u00ad\u201012) *Number suppressed if number of surgeries <5 Figure 4.2.2a: Number of pancreatic cancer surgeries, by province (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total AB 47 60 56 45 79 73 85 92 111 648 BC 60 76 73 87 76 72 55 83 92 674 MB 13 7 16 16 13 19 33 16 31 164 NB 16 14 7 11 * 9 6 11 9 85 NL 14 6 7 * 6 14 7 8 13 80 NS 21 13 28 14 24 25 22 18 16 181 ON 155 209 200 213 199 238 235 288 316 2053 SK 11 11 13 10 17 6 9 17 11 105 Canada 337 396 400 401 416 456 452 533 599 3990 P a g e | 53 Figure 4.2.2b: Number of institutions performing pancreatic cancer surgeries, by province (2004-\u00ad\u201012) The outcomes of surgery also depend on complexity of surgical approach. Among the three surgical approaches, Whipple procedures (pancreaticoduodenectomy) were performed in the majority of cases (72%), with open distal pancreatectomy accounting for a remaining 25% of procedures. A minimally invasive approach was adopted for only 2.8% of the procedures. Travel Distance Overall, a reduction in the proportion of population within one hour travel distance of pancreatic surgical cancer care was noticed for all provinces, albeit of different magnitudes. Median travel distances increased in all provinces when comparisons were made between first and last three fiscal years (Table 4.2.2b). The greatest increase was found in Newfoundland, with median of 193 extra kilometers travelled by the patients to receive pancreatic cancer surgery. In Ontario, the 50% reduction in number of institutions performing pancreatic surgeries resulted in a median of 5 additional kilometers, associated with 3% lower proportion of population within 1 hour travel distance. The reduction in the number of facilities in New Brunswick affected the median travel distance, but not the proportion of population within one hour of travel time. The remaining provinces showed changes in patients traveling more than an hour without any major changes in structure of care i.e. facility distribution. Figures 4.2.2c and 4.2.2d can be used to visualize the geographic distribution of facilities providing pancreatic cancer surgical care in 2004-\u00ad\u201006 and 2010-\u00ad\u201012. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Hospitals Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies P a g e | 54 TABLE 4.2.2B: CHANGE IN MEDIAN TRAVEL DISTANCES FROM 2004-\u00ad\u201006 TO 2010-\u00ad\u201012 Province 2004-\u00ad\u201006 2010-\u00ad\u201012 Change from 2010-\u00ad\u201012 to 2004-\u00ad\u201006 Median Travel Distance in kilometers [IQR] % in 1 hour travel time Median Travel Distance in kilometers [IQR] % in 1 hour travel time Difference in Median Travel Distances (km) AB 17 [128] 64 22 [165] 57 +5 BC 17 [59] 60 28 [59] 57 +11 MB 10 [104] 64 16 [94] 59 +6 NB 60 [105] 35 102 [146] 35 +42 NL 79 [400] 44 272 [405] 25 +194 NS 43 [164] 47 115 [292] 36 +72 ON 27 [73] 64 32 [76] 61 +5 SK 118 [220] 43 155 [204] 35 +37 Resection Rate Overall, a majority of the provinces reported an increase in adjusted resection rates for pancreatic cancer over time, except from New Brunswick and Newfoundland. Figure 4.2.2e shows that Alberta had the highest resection rate for pancreatic cancer surgeries, increasing from 4.5 to 7.8 resections per capita over the two time periods. Manitoba and Ontario also saw an increase in resection rates over time, 2.9 and 1.9 (per, 100,000) respectively. There was substantial variation between the highest and lowest resection rates between provinces in 2010-\u00ad\u201012. In quantitative terms, the rate varied from 3.4 (per 100,000) in Newfoundland to 7.8 (per 100,000) in Alberta. Although the relative differences varied, the incidence rates for pancreatic cancer were higher than the observed resection rates for all the provinces.

Marked variations in annual mortality rates were observed over time, with the lowest annual mortality rate in Canada for pancreatic cancer surgeries found to be 2% in 2011 and 6% in 2005 (Figure 4.2.2f). In addition to variations in mortality rate observed over time, provincial differences in 9-\u00ad\u2010year average mortality rates were also apparent. Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan had rates higher than the national 9-\u00ad\u2010year average (Figure 4.2.2g).

Gender and year did not significantly predict the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality. A Whipple procedure was associated with a significantly higher risk when compared to distal pancreatectomy. In univariate analysis, hospital volume was significantly associated with the rate of mortality (p=0.003), but not surgeon volume. Figure 4.2.2h represents a simplistic view of the association between increasing annual hospital volume and mortality rate for pancreatic cancer resections in Canada. A steeper reduction in mortality rate is apparent with an initial increase in volume, with the trend stabilizing around 40 procedures per year. Hospital volume was a significant predictor of mortality in the multivariate regression model, after controlling for random hospital effect and provincial variations. Surgeon volume was only significantly associated with mortality risk without hospital related factors in the model. There were no significant differences in risk of mortality between Ontario and rest of Canada. Figure 4.2.2h: Annual hospital volume and mortality rate (%) for pancreatic cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) ! According to the model, an annual increase in 10 cases in a given hospital predicted a 22% decrease in the risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality after controlling for the influence of covariates and random clustering effects of individual hospitals. ! Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, theoretically a total of 89 additional lives could have been saved after pancreatic cancer surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012). 0 20 40 60 80 100 Mortality Rate (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 Annual Hospital Volume P a g e | 59 Length of Stay The median length of stay after a pancreatic resection in Canada during 2004 to 2012 was 11 days [IQR=9]. Over the course of nine years, the median length of stay decreased from 13 to 12 days in Canada (Table 4.2.2b). The provincial median hospital days ranged from 10 in Ontario to 15 in Saskatchewan with a majority of provinces having values between 13 and 14 days (Table 4.2.2c). An increase in discharge rate with increasing volume for both Whipple procedure and distal pancreatectomy resection types at median length of stay is depicted in Figure 4.4.2i. Figure 4.2.2j a) and b) demonstrate differences in predicted discharge rates between procedures at different points in time. Survival analysis confirmed a statistically significant association between patient age and co-\u00ad\u2010morbidity score with a longer length of stay (Appendix 5). There were no statistically significant differences in length of stay between males and females. As expected, Whipple procedures, being more complex, had longer length of hospital stay as compared to distal pancreatectomy. Furthermore, the requirement of additional organ resections (i.e. gall bladder, bowel resections) also predicted a higher number hospitalized days. The year-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010 year reductions in length of stay (Table 4.2.2b) were also confirmed after controlling for the effect of other covariates. Both hospital and surgeon volumes were significantly associated with shorter length of stay. Moreover, patients in Ontario also had higher chance of early discharge as compared to rest of Canada.

Overall, a total of 8083 liver resections were performed on patients with mean age of 62 (SD=11.7) years. Primary liver cancers constituted 24% of all procedures, while the remaining procedures were performed for secondary liver tumours. A total of 118 institutions performed liver surgeries over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period across Canada. As the annual number of surgeries increased 82%, the number of hospitals performing these resections decreased from 61 in 2004 to 42 in 2012. An increase in number of procedures was observed in all provinces except New Brunswick and Saskatchewan (Table 4.2.3a, and Figure 4.2.3a). Overall, the shift in the number of facilities over time was less pronounced than that observed for esophageal and pancreatic cancer surgeries (Figure 4.2.3b). A systematic shift in the number of facilities performing liver resections from 2004 to 2012 was evident in Manitoba (4 facilities to 1) and Ontario (29 centres to 20). Both of these provinces report good mortality rates and length of hospital stay relative to the pan-\u00ad\u2010 Canadian mean, which appears to demonstrate a positive benefit to these regionalization efforts. In the remaining provinces, the annual fluctuation in the number of facilities appeared to be a result of institutions undertaking a small liver surgical caseload (\u22642/year). Among the 118 institutions providing liver resection over 9-\u00ad\u2010year period, the median hospital volume was 61 resections per year [IQR=88]. The number of physicians performing liver resections stayed relatively constant over the years (119 in 2004 to 117 in 2012) with a median surgeon volume of 20 resections per year [IQR=18]. There are two types of resections for liver cancers: open and minimally invasive. A majority (93%) of resections were open procedures. Over the years, a shift towards minimally invasive procedures has been observed. In 2004, only 1% of minimally invasive procedures were performed, while this number has increased to about 11% in 2012 (Figure 4.2.3c). Minimally invasive procedures had a lower mortality rate (1.32%) as compared to open procedures (3.1%) over the study period.

It is worth noticing that there was at least one institution in each province carrying out the majority of procedures each year. The fluctuation in number of institutions from year over year was due to institutions with <5 cases annually. The shift in the number and location of institutions, and its impact on patient travel times can be visualized through a comparison of Figures 4.2.3d and 4.2.3e. Except for Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, no substantial variations in travel distances and proportion of population within one hour travel distance were observed across the provinces. In Nova Scotia, one major centre performed liver resections over the 9 year study period with small number of resections performed in other 5 centres. Therefore, the median increase in travel distance in Nova Scotia could be a result of random fluctuations in the location of patients within the province. Similar reasoning appears to apply in the context of Saskatchewan, with a substantial reduction in the median travel distance over the two time periods (114 kilometers). In spite of reductions in the number of facilities from 5 (average 2004-\u00ad\u201006) to 2 in 2010-\u00ad\u201012, the proportion of patients within one hour travel distance increased from 31% to 50% in Saskatchewan. The potential for bias in provinces with a small patient population should be kept in mind while interpreting these results. Ontario saw the biggest shift in number of institutions over time-\u00ad\u2010the systematic shift could be seen in data with a sudden drop in volume in one institution in a given year followed by a sudden jump in volume in another.

Alberta had the highest (14 per 100,000) while New Brunswick had the lowest (6.9 per 100,000) resection rates in last 3 years (2010-\u00ad\u20102012). The highest improvement in resection rates for pancreatic cancers was observed in Manitoba, increasing from 5.3 to 12 resections per 100,000 populations. A comparison with Figure 4.2.3g points towards a general trend that the provinces with highest resection rates had among the lowest in-\u00ad\u2010 hospital mortality rates.

Non-\u00ad\u2010significant differences in mortality rates between Ontario and rest of Canada were observed. The associated mortality risk for liver resections also significantly reduced over time. Figure 4.2.3i shows a trend towards lower mortality rates with increasing annual hospital volume. These differences in mortality rates with increasing hospital volume were non-\u00ad\u2010significant after adjusting for random hospital or provincial differences. Surgeon volume, however, did predict a lower mortality risk in adjusted models (Appendix 4).

Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, theoretically a total of 15 additional lives could have been saved after liver cancer surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012). Length of Stay The overall median length of stay for liver resections was 7 days [IQR=5], with a median reduction of one day from 2004 to 2012 (Table 4.2.3b). Saskatchewan had the highest median length of stay for liver resections (Table 4.2.3c).

In total, 30,284 relevant procedures were performed in 76 institutions. The mean age of patients was 66.7 (SD=10) years, with 52% of patients being male. The median hospital volume was 129 surgeries per year [IQR=108], whereas the median surgeon volume was 40 [IQR=27]. The annual number of lung surgeries increased 29%, from 2942 in 2004 to 3795 in 2012. An increase in number of procedures was observed in all provinces, except Nova Scotia (Table 4.2.4a, Figure 4.2.4a). Over the same time period, the number of institutions performing lung surgeries decreased from 65 to 43 (Figure 4.2.4b). The three known provinces that have taken steps to actively regionalize lung cancer surgical care are Ontario, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Subsequent reductions in number of institutions performing these resections were observed in Ontario (37 to 24), and British Columbia (8 to 4). Although a shift from 3 to 2 institutions was observed in Manitoba, there was one centre carrying out 94% of lung cancer surgeries in 2012. Lung resections were classified into five categories based on surgical complexities associated with each approach. In order of increasing complexity, these include: 1) Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery minimally invasive (VATS) sub-\u00ad\u2010lobar resection, 2) Open thoracotomy sub-\u00ad\u2010lobar resection, 3) VATS lobectomy, 4) Open lobectomy, and 5) Pneumonectomy. Open lobectomy was the most performed procedure (35%), consisting of the removal of a full lobe of the lung followed by open sub-\u00ad\u2010lobar resection (28%), which is the removal of only a portion of a lobe. Lung cancer surgeries are normally performed by Thoracic surgeons, although 25% of lung surgeries in Canada were performed by general surgeons. A higher proportion of surgeries completed by general surgeons is reported in New Brunswick 52%, Ontario (32%) and Saskatchewan (47%). It should be noted that coding practices for surgeon specialty are subject to debate, as described in Appendix 3.

An interesting finding is that the implementation of standards for regionalization of thoracic cancer surgeries in Ontario and accounts of such measures in British Columbia and Manitoba had mixed impacts on travel times. An increase in median travel time and the respective proportion of patients within 1 hour driving 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Hospitals Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies P a g e | 72 distance to the surgical centre was observed in Ontario with a move towards regionalization. However, the median travel time for lung resections was reduced in British Columbia and Manitoba between the earliest and latest 3 year intervals. These findings are astounding given the clear evidence of a shift to fewer facilities. In British Columbia, there were 8 facilities performing lung surgeries in 2004, but there were only 4 left in 2012. In spite of occasional surgeries in other centres, the data shows consistent consolidation to these 4 high volume centres. Still, the proportion of patients within 1 hour driving distance increased by 6%, thus shortening the median travel distance over time. Similarly, a shift to 2 facilities (from 3) was evident in Manitoba around 2009-\u00ad\u201010 without any changes in proportion of population within 1 hour commute. In concordance with the findings for British Columbia, the median travel time decreased by 5 kilometers over time. While it could not be confirmed, Saskatchewan did not have a formal process for regionalization of cancer surgical care, yet a gradual reduction from 3 to 2 facilities is obvious in the data. The median travel time also decreased with an increase in the proportion of patients having driven less than an hour for surgery. A similar move from 4 facilities to 3 in Alberta resulted in minuscule changes travel distance and time. The geographic maps presented in Figures 4.2.4c and 4.2.4d can further assist in visualization of distribution of facilities across the provinces and any changes in these distributions over time.

Manitoba and Nova Scotia did not show such a sharp rise in resection rates over the intervals under study, with rates that were already markedly higher than the other provinces (51 and 48 resections per capita, respectively) in 2010-\u00ad\u20102012. The rates increased across all provinces from 2004-\u00ad\u201006 to 2010-\u00ad\u201012, except Saskatchewan. Between Newfoundland, with the lowest resection rate for lung surgeries, and New Brunswick with the highest rate, there was a difference of 30 resections per capita. These findings combined with the relative differences between the incidence and resection rates possibly indicate disparities in care delivery based on geographic location. Figure 4.2.4e: Age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates per 100,000 populations for lung cancer surgeries In-\u00ad\u2010Hospital Mortality The overall lung cancer surgery in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rate for the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period was 2.3%, with a large (50%) reduction in mortality occurring between 2004 (3.2%) and 2012 (1.6%) (Figure 4.2.4f). Differences between provinces were also apparent. New Brunswick had a mortality rate 1.4% higher than the 9-\u00ad\u2010year national average and Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia had marginally higher age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates. A reduction in mortality rates over time within each province was seen as well (Figure 4.2.4g). For instance, Ontario had a crude mortality rate of 3.1% in the first 3 years (2004-\u00ad\u201006) which reduced to 1.8% in last 3 years (2010-\u00ad\u201012). Similarly, a reduction from 2.38% to 1.09% in British Columbia, and 2.08% to 1.6% in Alberta was recorded over the same period.

The risk of mortality also appeared to have significantly reduced over time. Figure 4.2.4h: Shift in lung cancer procedures in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012) One of the possible reasons for this reduction in mortality rates after lung cancer resections is a shift towards minimally invasive procedures over time, which is associated with lower mortality rates (Figure 4.2.4h).77 Alternatively, it is also possible that lower-\u00ad\u2010risk sublobar VATS resections were able to be selected rather than higher risk lobectomy and pneumonectomy procedures due to an increase in earlier detection of smaller tumours during this time period. In univariate analysis, both hospital and surgeon volumes were significantly associated with the mortality rate. Similarly, thoracic surgeons had a lower mortality rate (2%) on average than the general surgeons. Figure 4.2.4i demonstrates the crude mortality rate reduction for annual hospital volume. After controlling for random hospital related factors or provincial variations, hospital volume was significantly associated with a reduced risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality (Appendix 4). Surgeon volume and specialty significantly predicted the risk of mortality in the model but the effect disappeared with the inclusion of hospital volume. Furthermore, the random effects of hospital were also significant implying that factors other than volume and specialty also predict mortality.

Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, theoretically a total of 209 additional lives could have been saved after lung cancer surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012). Length of Stay The median length of stay of 6 days [IQR=5] for lung cancer surgeries was the lowest amongst the five cancer types. Over the course of the nine-\u00ad\u2010year study period, the median length of stay decreased from 7 days to 5 days across Canada (Table 4.2.4b). There was a median difference of three days between Manitoba, with shortest hospital stay (5 days), and Newfoundland and New Brunswick with the longest hospital stay (8 days) (Table 4.2.4c).

Pneumonectomy and open procedures showed the greatest variability in length of stay at a volume of at least 250 resections a year (Figure 4.2.4k). TABLE 4.2.4B: LENGTH OF STAY IN CANADA AFTER LUNG CANCER SURGERY, BY YEAR After controlling for hospital clustering effect and other factors in the model, higher age, co-\u00ad\u2010 morbidity score, and male patients were associated with higher risk of longer length of stay (Appendix 5). In comparison to the relatively lower risk VATS sub-\u00ad\u2010lobar resection, all other procedures required relatively longer hospitalization. Yearly reductions in number of hospital days were significant. Surgeries in Ontario predicted a significantly shorter hospital stay in comparison with those resections performed elsewhere in Canada. Both the hospital and surgeon volume significantly predicted shorter length of stay with increasing volume. Interestingly, surgeries conducted by general surgeons predicted a shorter length of stay for the patients, but the differences were not significant.

Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, a total of 3335 hospital days could potentially have been saved annually across Canada for lung cancer surgeries. 4.2.5 OVARIAN CANCER SURGERY Ovarian cancer resections constituted the second highest case volume, with 16,949 surgeries performed in 232 institutions across Canada (excluding Quebec). The mean age of patients was 56.2 (SD=14.6) years. The median hospital volume was 68 resections per year [IQR=101], and the median surgeon volume was 16 resections per year [IQR=26]. The annual number of surgeries increased 11% from 1814 in 2004 to 2030 in 2012. A consistent increase in the annual number of procedures was observed in Ontario, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia (Table 4.5.2a; Figure 4.2.5a). Although the number of hospitals performing ovarian resections decreased from 176 to 150 (Figure 4.2.5b) over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period, this reduction appears to be a result of random year-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010year fluctuations in institutions with a low case volume (<2 surgeries per year). 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 1 Discharge Rate (%) 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 Annual Hospital Volume 4 Days 6 Days 8 Days 0 .1 .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 1 Discharge Rate (%) 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 Annual Hospital Volume 4 Days 6 Days 8 Days P a g e | 81 TABLE 4.2.5A: NUMBER OF OVARIAN CANCER SURGERIES, BY PROVINCE (2004-\u00ad\u201012) *Number suppressed if number of surgeries <5 Ovarian resection types were classified into six categories by an expert Gynecological Oncologist based on the degree of surgical intensity, which stratifies the associated risks. Procedure types in order of increasing complexity are: omentectomy, minimally invasive oophorectomy/fallopian tube resection, open oophorectomy/fallopian tube resection, minimally invasive simple hysterectomy, open simple hysterectomy, and radical hysterectomy. Gynecological cancer procedures could involve any combination of either the removal of ovaries, fallopian tube(s), or uterus using a minimally invasive or open approach. Procedures were classified based on the most complex surgical intervention in cases where there was a combination of interventions. For instance, if a patient underwent omentectomy and open radical hysterectomy, the procedure was classified as open radical hysterectomy. A majority of procedures were categorized as an open simple hysterectomy (59%) and an open oophorectomy/fallopian tube resection (29%). It is not uncommon in ovarian cancer surgeries that patients undergo further debulking or another associated resection at a later point in time. The present data only provided records for one patient visit, without the possibility of accounting for multiple visits by the same patient for a follow up procedures. Therefore, any follow-\u00ad\u2010up procedure(s) would be treated as a new cancer occurrence and a new surgical case. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total AB 254 233 238 241 255 209 253 238 261 2182 BC 317 360 360 331 330 329 337 356 331 3051 MB 82 90 101 93 88 98 121 113 109 895 NB 59 74 58 52 39 60 72 55 57 526 NL 38 40 39 32 38 36 41 45 53 362 NS 72 76 74 71 85 99 84 79 91 731 ON 893 888 923 887 876 916 946 957 1054 8340 PEI 13 10 * * * * 10 9 * 62 SK 86 77 81 99 109 95 85 99 69 800 Canada 1814 1848 1877 1808 1825 1847 1949 1951 2030 16949 P a g e | 82 Figure 4.2.5a: Number of ovarian cancer surgeries, by province (2004-\u00ad\u201012) Figure 4.2.5b: Number of institutions performing ovarian cancer surgeries, by province (2004-\u00ad\u201012) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Surgeries Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Number of Hospitals Fiscal Year Alberta Atlantic British Columbia Ontario Prairies P a g e | 83 Travel Distance Ovarian cancer procedures had the shortest median travel times in all provinces for the five high risk cancers discussed here. This trend holds true for all the provinces, across all the years (Table 4.2.5b). They appear to be least centralized, given the high number of institutions with small annual case load (<5 resections). Overall, the number of facilities varied from year to year within the same province due to volume fluctuations among facilities providing <5 resections per year. For example, 102 institutions performed at least one surgery for ovarian cancer in Ontario over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period. In 2004, 74 institutions performed at least one surgery as compared to 63 in 2012. However, if only institutions with more than one surgery in a given year are counted, the reduction from 2004 to 2012 was 58 to 53 hospitals. Similar trends were observed in other provinces as well. For instance, a total of 14 hospitals performed at least one surgery over 9 years (10 in 2004 to 5 in 2012) in Manitoba. Although only 2 big institutions were carrying out the highest caseload, the fluctuation in number of facilities each year was mainly a result of institutions carrying out small (1 to 5) number of surgeries one year and nothing the next year. The random fluctuations in hospitals performing ovarian cancer surgeries could have impacted the difference in median travel distance and proportion of individuals within an hour distance of surgical centre. Figures 4.2.5c and 4.2.5d demonstrate the distribution of institutions performing ovarian cancer surgeries across provinces and the respective changes in proportion of patients within 1-\u00ad\u20103 hours commute. As opposed to the other cancer surgeries, 2 centres in Prince Edward Island performed a small number of surgeries throughout the 9-\u00ad\u2010year study period.

Apart from Manitoba with an increase of 5 resections per capita, the remaining provinces had minimal changes in resection rates over the two time period. In 2010-\u00ad\u201012, there was a difference of over 5 resections per 100,000 between the province with highest number of ovarian cancer surgeries per capita (Manitoba) to provinces with the lowest (Alberta, Nova Scotia) (Figure 4.2.5e). The relatively small inter-\u00ad\u2010 provincial differences in resection rates do not correlate well with the large differences in in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortalities in Figure 4.2.5g. Figure 4.2.5e: Age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates per 100,000 populations for ovarian cancer surgeries In-\u00ad\u2010Hospital Mortality Ovarian cancers had the lowest mortality rate amongst the five cancers under investigation. The overall in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality rate for the 9-\u00ad\u2010year study period was 0.9%, declining from 1.3% in 2004 to 0.69% in 2012 (Figure 4.2.5f), with variations is mortality rates evident over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period. Provincially, there was apparent variation. Prince Edward Island had the highest in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality of 2.84% (SD=1.3) although it only performed 60 resections in 9 years and Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick had age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates that were considerably higher than the national 9-\u00ad\u2010year average of 0.9% (Figure 4.2.4g). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 AB BC MB NB NL NS ON SK Rate (/100,000) Resection Rate (2010-\u00ad\u201012) Resection Rate (2004-\u00ad\u201006) P a g e | 87 Figure 4.2.5f: Annual age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates for ovarian cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) Figure 4.2.5g: Age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates for ovarian cancer surgeries (2004-\u00ad\u201012) In univariate analysis, hospital volume was significantly associated with mortality rate (Figure 4.2.4h). These outcomes persisted even after controlling for provincial differences unaccounted for in the model. There were non-\u00ad\u2010significant differences between obstetrics/gynecologists and gynecological oncologists for in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality, while general surgeons had a significantly higher risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality. A non-\u00ad\u2010significant association between surgeon volume and risk of in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality was observed. Higher age, co-\u00ad\u2010morbidity score, and the addition of bowel resections for complete resection predicted a significantly higher risk of mortality.

Assuming that the quality of care and outcomes are the same across all the hospitals in the highest volume tercile, theoretically a total of 48 additional lives could have been saved after ovarian cancer surgeries in Canada (2004-\u00ad\u201012).

There were only minute differences between the provinces for length of hospital stay. Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland had the highest (5 days), whereas British Columbia had the lowest median length of stay (3 days) (Table 4.2.5b). No variations in median length of stay were observed over time (Table 4.2.5c). Omentectomy and open procedures (oophorectomy, fallopian tube resection, simple hysterectomy) showed a strong association between higher facility volume and increased discharge rate (Figure 4.2.5i). Patient-\u00ad\u2010related factors, bowel resections and an increasing number of combined gynecological resections during the same operation predicted a significantly higher length of stay. Similarly, compared to minimally invasive oophorectomy, the risk of longer hospitalization was higher for all other resection types. A higher annual hospital volume was significantly associated with lower length of stay, as opposed to higher surgeon volume that was associated with a higher risk of prolonged hospitalization. There were non-\u00ad\u2010 significant differences between obstetrician/gynecologists and gynecological oncologists, however, general surgeons had significantly higher risk of longer length of stay. Moreover, non-\u00ad\u2010significant differences existed between the Ontario and rest of the country in the number of hospital days post ovarian cancer resections.

Given the varying geographic, political, and economic differences between the different provinces, it is rather impractical to have one set of standards for every jurisdiction. \" Passive centralization has occurred in most provinces (other than Ontario) despite not having a formal regionalization strategy \" There appears to be minimal regulation at the provincial level for organization of delivery structure, and availability of published guidelines to ensure standardization of high quality care. o Ontario is the only province with specific externally published standards and guidelines for directing high risk surgical procedures to designated centres \" The key informant interviews revealed a lack of accountability in most of the country; inability to enact change; or a formal process to track and evaluate outcomes of surgical care \" The most striking finding of this pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian analysis is the tremendous variance in care across the country. In many of the surgeries evaluated, the mortality difference between the provinces with the lowest and highest mortality rates shows an increase of mortality of three to four times. Similarly, the length of stay can vary by 2-\u00ad\u20103 days on average per patient depending on where the procedure is performed. By opting for regionalization policies, not only could we influence mortality but we could do it in a more efficient and cost effective manner. These results are clinically striking and statistically significant as well, which further emphasizes their significance. \" Particularly in the case of ovarian cancer, the current state of care seems to be very much in need of a regionalization effort. It has half the number of cases nationally as lung cancer, but three times the number of institutions performing these surgeries with many of the centres reporting a very small total annual case volume. Considering the demonstrated improvements in mortality rates from regionalization to high volume centres, it encourages health care planners to consider addressing this issue along with topic experts and regional health system stakeholders through the implementation of regionalization policies. P a g e | 92 5.1 OVERVIEW In this section, an insight into the structures of care for the delivery of cancer surgical procedures is presented along with reports of outcomes compared to the national average. In the absence of available reporting on policies and standards in place for the delivery of complex cancer surgeries, structured interviews were conducted with experts across Canada to gain their perspective on the delivery and organization of surgical cancer care in their respective province. The participants included practicing surgeons, heads of surgical oncology, or stakeholders who are involved with decision making for cancer surgical care. Provincial report cards are presented to allow for intra-\u00ad\u2010 and inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial comparisons on mortality, length of stay, and travel times based on the latest available data. The rates of mortality, median length of stay and travel times for provinces with smaller population sizes are subject to large variations. For instance, if twenty esophagectomies are performed in a province, only one instance of mortality can increase the mortality rate from 0% to 5%. Therefore, 3-\u00ad\u2010year crude averages for the primary outcomes are presented to draw fair comparisons. Similarly, a number of hospitals across Canada performed only one surgery per year, which affected the total number of institutions performing surgeries in a given year. For the purpose of addressing the large range of institutional volumes and random variation within a given hospital, a count of facilities with an annual volume of >5 was also stated. The discussion below is intended to be used by stakeholders to broaden their understanding of current organizational structures of surgical care and associated patient-\u00ad\u2010 based outcomes in their respective provinces. 5.2 ALBERTA Alberta Health Services directly oversees the structure of the entire health care system in the province, including the delivery of the five cancer surgeries under discussion in this report. The province is further divided into 6 zones. Cancer Control Alberta oversees the cancer centre-\u00ad\u2010based delivery of chemotherapy and radiotherapy oncological services. The zones are authorized to oversee cancer care, including surgical cancer care within their jurisdiction, working together with the institutions undertaking the procedures. Alberta is described as having an asymmetric bipolar structure of care, with the South zone managing a significant portion of the total provincial surgical volume and equipped with a broader infrastructure for delivering surgical cancer services. Recognizing the need for a provincial body for policy-\u00ad\u2010related decisions concerning cancer surgical care, the \"Strategic Clinical Network\" has been established in association with Alberta Health Services. Overall, it appears that Alberta has some quality improvement initiatives underway, but there is nothing specifically with regards to \u2018active\u2019 regionalization or the implementation of policy guidelines for the cancer types under discussion in this report. Based on conversations with key informants, it appears that there has been passive regionalization for some surgical procedures as a result of steps taken by individual surgeons to open P a g e | 93 surgical centres. Table 5.1 provides evidence for some form of consolidation of esophagus, lung, and liver surgeries with an attendant increase in the number of resections. The number of resections carried out in 2012 was higher than the 3-\u00ad\u2010year provincial average for all procedures. Ovarian cancer surgeries had the second highest volume in the province, yet they appear to be least centralized. Only three institutions had a volume greater than five in 2012, whereas two centres undertook greater than 90 resections. The crude, 3-\u00ad\u2010year mortality rates appear to be higher than the national average for pancreatic and ovarian cancer procedures. Similarly, the median length of stay was higher than the national average for all but ovarian cancer resections, which indicates room for improvement. The travel distance was more than twice longer for esophagectomies as compared to the other procedures, with the lowest (49%) proportion of patients within one-\u00ad\u2010hour commute.

The BCCA plays a supporting role in improving the quality of surgical care in the province. For instance, a \u2018Surgical Oncology Network\u2019 has been established to improve coordination and communication between oncology service providers and the surgeons, in addition to connecting these surgery providers with the BCCA. The Surgical Oncology Network has different committees that aid in the planning, support, and implementation of its strategic initiatives, including the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines, continuing professional development, knowledge transfer, and research and outcomes evaluation. The key informant interviews revealed that the thoracic cancer surgeries have been formally regionalized in British Columbia with minimum direct involvement from the BCCA. However, the BCCA appears to have recently played a significant role in the centralization of gynecological surgeries. In one of the thoracic surgical cancer care centres in Kelowna, the initial assessments are completed via video-\u00ad\u2010conferencing with surgical teams to help ameliorate some of the significant travel burden that would otherwise limit access to surgical care for remote patients. This example of innovation may be helpful for jurisdictions looking to limit the impact of regionalization policies on patients. The analysis of data shows that British Columbia appears to have managed the increasing volume of lung, liver, and esophageal procedures by consolidating surgical care into four large volume centres. The annual number of procedures for pancreatic, liver, and lung cancer was higher than the 3-\u00ad\u2010year provincial average implying an increasing case load. Overall, the 3-\u00ad\u2010year mortality rates were lower than the national average for all the procedures under investigation. The number of institutions performing less than 5 cases annually may present with potential room for improvement. For instance, a total of 31 institutions carried out ovarian cancer surgeries but only eight of these centres were conducting more than five resections in 2012 (Table 5.2). This number does not represent the vast case volume differences across these eight institutions, which had a case load ranging from 6 to 174 surgeries. Similarly, five of nine institutions performed a small number of pancreatic procedures. Although the 3-\u00ad\u2010year crude mortality rate was over 5 times less than the national average, the median length of stay was higher than the national average for pancreatic cancer procedures. Similarly, the mortality rates were roughly 50% less than the national average for ovarian and esophageal procedures, with a median length of stay lower than the national average. Each of the procedures was generally within an hour travel time for a majority of the patients. The higher number of institutions performing ovarian procedures could account for shortest travel burden on the patients for these resections.

Cancer care consists of a primary facility in Winnipeg and a secondary institution located in Brandon. Given the presence of two major cancer treatment centres in the province, the surgical care seems to be \u2018passively\u2019 centralized. There is one institution in Winnipeg managing the highest case load for all five high-\u00ad\u2010risk cancer surgeries. Based on our discussions with expert surgeons in the region, there is evidence of planned consolidation of thoracic cancer surgeries. In 2007, all thoracic surgeries were moved to a single centre in Winnipeg, with only a small number of thoracic surgeries still carried out in Brandon. The number of surgeries for all five cancers did not show much deviance from the 3-\u00ad\u2010year provincial average. A strong trend for consolidation of surgical care to a small number of institutions is evident for all five cancer procedures. For instance, only one institution was performing liver resections in 2012, down from four in 2004. Likewise, the number of P a g e | 96 institutions performing ovarian cancer surgeries was down from ten to five over the study period. In spite of apparent centralization of surgical care, the median travel distances remained close to 15 kilometers for all surgeries. There were small variations in the proportion of patients who travelled less than an hour for surgical care across all the procedures. About 70% of the patients for ovarian cancer surgeries travelled less than an hour, compared to 53% for esophageal cancer procedures. The case study of Manitoba presents with an interesting scenario. The 3-\u00ad\u2010year crude mortality rate for esophageal cancer resections was more than three times that of the national average, whereas the median length of stay was 2 days higher (Table 5.3). Some of the variation in mortality rate could be explained by the small total provincial case load leading to significant year over year variance; however it may also emphasize the significance of factors other than hospital volume on patient outcomes (i.e. surgeon specialty, staff training). A lack of available data on such measures limits our ability to comment on the observed differences in the rate of mortality for esophageal resections. Pancreatic resection data reported a mortality rate and length of stay higher than the national average in spite of the fact that these resections were carried out in only 2 institutions.

Although the various cancer services are coordinated by the New Brunswick Cancer Network, the delivery and organization of surgical care seems to be the responsibility of the RHAs and the provider institution. By nature of relatively small geography, surgery in New Brunswick operates out of a small number of centres and has a small total surgical case load. Overall, higher volume centres were located in Moncton, Fredericton, St. John, and Edmundston. There is an obvious overlap between institutions performing resections for all five cancer types. Based on our interviews with key informants, there does not appear to be any formal centralization initiatives directed specifically towards cancer surgeries. New Brunswick had smallest number of resections of all the provinces. Therefore, year over year fluctuations in the number of surgeries also affected the number of institutions performing surgeries annually. Although a variation in number of facilities was observed over time, it could mainly be a result of year-\u00ad\u2010over-\u00ad\u2010year fluctuations in the number of surgeries. For instance, the number of institutions for pancreatic cancer reduced from six in 2004 to three in 2012 (Table 5.4). However, it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of surgical institutions was a planned move or a result of random fluctuations in the number of resectable cases within that facility catchment area. Small variations in the number of surgeries were observed over the most recent 3-\u00ad\u2010year period. None of the institutions for liver, esophagus, and pancreatic cancer had a case volume greater than five in 2012. The 3-\u00ad\u2010year, crude mortality rate was smaller than the national average for all cancer resections except lung. The median length of stay was smaller than the national average only for esophageal cancer. However, small case volumes limit our ability to present a valid comparison between the national average and New Brunswick data. The province might be better compared with other provinces with small case load and relatively large geographic catchment areas. Similarly, the travel times show vast differences between the different cancer types, but the large interquartile ranges demand caution when interpreting these results.

There are four Regional Health Authorities in the province, who are responsible for health care delivery within their jurisdictions. Similar to New Brunswick, Newfoundland has a small case volume for all five cancer resections. These procedures appear to be performed in one central location in St. John's, except for a small number of resections performed by other institutions for ovarian cancer. Therefore, it appears that there has been an informal process of consolidation of services within the province. According to our experts, hepatic and thoracic resections are performed only in St. John's. Although Eastern Health was the biggest, stand-\u00ad\u2010alone provincial body, it was mostly involved with the coordination of medical and radiation oncology services, with no comparable organization with a provincial mandate to oversee cancer surgical care across the four regional health authorities. The hospital(s) undertaking the surgeries were the groups primarily responsible for making decisions concerning surgical care, including the scope of practice for surgeons. According to the analysis of provincial data, the 3-\u00ad\u2010year mortality rates were higher than the national average for esophagus and lung resections but the small number of cases does not present a fair comparison (Table 5.5). The median length of stay was 3 days more than the national average for pancreatic and lung resections. The potential impact of the consolidation of care to one large centre is visible in longer patient travel distances for esophageal, pancreatic, liver and lung cancers. Six institutions performing ovarian resection do not appear to have resulted in higher mortality rates and have retained a short patient travel distance in Newfoundland and Labrador.

For more than a decade, surgical cancer care has primarily been organized by each of the nine District Health Authorities who are responsible for health care service planning and allocation for residents within the region as well as neighbouring Atlantic provinces. Except for the reporting of surgical wait times, the provincial oversight for surgical care is minimal. It is also unclear how the planned move to single provincial health authority (in April 2015) for adult clinical care will impact delivery of cancer surgical care. The major cancer surgical centres in Nova Scotia are located in Halifax and Sydney. The available data and expert opinion supports passive regionalization of surgical care to 1 or 2 major surgical centres in Halifax and Sydney. The annual case volume did not show much deviance from the 3-\u00ad\u2010year provincial average (2010-\u00ad\u20102012), and neither did the number of institutions from 2004-\u00ad\u20102012 (Table 5.6). Except for ovarian cancer, a majority of surgeries were carried out in two major centres. P a g e | 100 High 3-\u00ad\u2010year crude mortality rates for liver, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers present with an interesting discussion and an opportunity for improvement. Outcomes of esophageal and lung surgeries were better than the national average, although the number of cases for were too small for a meaningful comparison. The added burden of travel with higher risk of mortality for pancreatic and liver resections may point towards a need for improvements in care processes.

Through initiatives led by CCO, Ontario has taken the most formal, active, and clearly defined approach to the regionalization of high-\u00ad\u2010risk complex cancer surgery in Canada. With respect to the cancers evaluated in this report, CCO has implemented evidence-\u00ad\u2010based guidelines and standards for thoracic and hepatopancreatobiliary cancers, while the guideline development process for ovarian cancer was initiated in 2010 and implementation is currently under way. P a g e | 101 Pancreatic cancer surgical regionalization started in 1999 and continued through the early 2000s, while thoracic surgery initiated the regionalization process in Ontario starting in 2004-\u00ad\u20102005. This complex multifaceted undertaking was not instantaneous, but over time led to the consolidation of case volume through the successful implementation of explicit and financially supported regionalization policies as outlined by CCO (www.cancercare.on.ca). To support this process of regionalization, practice standards were established in an evidence-\u00ad\u2010based manner to clearly delineate definitions of high volume centres, minimum institutional requirements such as the availability of surgical step down units or training requirements for surgeons, and other key components to promoting high quality care. Communities of practice for each specialty were encouraged to participate in the development and implementation of these standards, but also to set national priorities and facilitate the transfer of knowledge. This regionalization work is reflected in the observed lower number of institutions offering these cancer surgeries and higher mean surgeon case volumes relative to those reported in much of Canada. Despite this active management of regionalization in Ontario, there are still a number of smaller centres and presently unregionalized cancers such as ovarian cancer that persist. This speaks to the great challenges facing governing bodies as they implement quality improvement initiatives. With regards to the province-\u00ad\u2010specific outcomes and travel times in Ontario, most metrics are comparable to the rest of Canada. The travel times for most cancers are reasonable for most patients, with the vast majority of patients able to access surgical care within the hour threshold, although esophageal cancer care sees times that tend to exceed one hour. The length of stay for all cancers is at or below the national averages. The 3-\u00ad\u2010year mortality rates for most operations are near the national average, but this may be a result of a sampling bias as Ontario represents roughly 50% of all the total surgical cases performed across Canada in most of the cancers evaluated (Table 5.7). A better evaluation of regionalization in Ontario may be to compare mortality rates over time relative to the rest of the country, which largely had minimal formal regionalization policies (although province-\u00ad\u2010specific undertakings are outlined accordingly in this section). This is reported in Figure 5.7. At face value, the pancreatic mortality is comparable to the non-\u00ad\u2010regionalized cases over time. When evaluating this number, one has to keep in mind that the surgeries in Ontario were largely regionalized by this period of time and interestingly, there is a disproportionate rise in case volume in Ontario compared to the rest of the country. The mortality rates may be influenced by a greater number of cases, which would naturally result in a larger raw number of deaths, although it is difficult to ascertain for certain with administrative data. The results for lung cancer surgery, liver and esophagus are more complex in nature. The crossing curves make statistical analysis difficult. This analytical challenge notwithstanding, it does appear that the results are P a g e | 102 inferior to the national statistics although multivariate regression analysis does not show significance. For lung cancer, the most regionalized cancer type in the time period studied, the mortality in Ontario seems to converge with the rates for the rest of Canada. Generally speaking, it is difficult to measure differences when a series of measures are undertaken over time. Very different results could be found if Ontario was evaluated the day after the policies were published or if some duration of time was allowed to pass before initiating evaluation to allow processes to become streamlined and fully integrated into the health care system. Overarching this evaluation issue, there has been a considerable number of other changes in the health system that could be confounding the results. Another plausible explanation for differing mortality observations is that there is an increased number of patients receiving curative resections in Ontario (See Chapter 4). Resection rate is a combination of cancer stage at time of presentation, indications for surgery and technical considerations. Regionalization, in theory, facilitates collaboration between highly trained surgeons while also encouraging the development of specialized staff and infrastructure that may allow patients with a higher stage disease or more complex co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities to undergo resection in Ontario. The higher risk of mortality may be resultant from this increased patient complexity. With this said, it is important to remember that this is just a hypothetical explanation for the observed findings. In this context, mortality and length of stay have both fallen over time, and the attributable component of regionalization to this is undeterminable. Perhaps the greatest impact of regionalization can be found in more subjective measures that are difficult to measure such as adherence to guidelines, appropriate surgical decision making, or effective utilization of medical and radiation oncology to name a few. Over time, an improvement in care across many domains of cancer care has been observed, but there continues to be a tremendous variability in outcomes. In the Ontario example, there has been a tightening of this variance, which allows for more consistent care. Overall, these outcomes provide a complex and unanswerable series of questions. What does appear to be missing in the Ontario experience is quality feedback loops on facility specific outcomes. The Ontario regionalization experience serves as a robust, if not complex, model of implementation of regionalization for the rest of Canada. The large population of Ontario, the geographic density and infrastructure are not necessarily transferrable, but the lessons learned from successfully implementing these significant structural changes despite the challenges can serve to provide lessons for other future adopters. Given that Ontario has utilized a multi-\u00ad\u2010focal approach to actively implementing regionalization, it is impossible to dissect out the impact of regionalization on the quality of patient care in isolation, but as a whole, Ontario\u2019s regionalization activities appear to have positively affected the delivery of care.

There is a single cancer centre on the island, although the majority of relevant cancer surgeries were transferred to institutions in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. The territories also follow a similar pattern of referral to other provinces for their surgical cancer cases. Surgeries for residents in Yukon were performed in either British Columbia or Alberta for all five cancers except for esophageal cancer surgeries that were performed in British Columbia. Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta undertook surgeries for residents in Nunavut and Northwest Territories. All four jurisdictions have extremely small caseloads, so it would be inappropriate to perform any comparisons. 5.10 SASKATCHEWAN The cancer surgical care in Saskatchewan is overseen by the \"Surgical Initiative Branch\" of Saskatchewan Ministry of Health. Saskatchewan Cancer Agency (SCA) does not have a role in the organization of oversight of surgical care in the province. Our best efforts could not capture any information regarding regionalization, control of surgical volume, and/or creation of designated surgical centres. However, there are reports of initiatives taken in 2009 to improve surgical care and reduce wait times for certain surgical procedures, including cancer surgery. As part of this initiative, a specialist directory has been made available online that provides information on types of surgical procedure, the case volume, and wait times for last 12 months at each of the provider sites in their respective health regions. This is an example of the initiation of transparency of information policies that are aimed at improving system performance. The annual case volume for four of the five cancer types seems to be decreasing, and along with it, the number of facilities providing surgical care (Table 5.8). For instance, the number of institutions providing liver cancer surgery dropped from 4 centres to 2, and from 3 to 2 for lung resections from 2004 to 2012. These institutions were concentrated in Saskatoon and Regina. It was unclear if the reduction in the number of institutions was related to random variations associated with the small number of cases, or an intent to consolidate these services. Other institutions either had very low volume or there is an evidence of consolidation. Still, there is more room for institutions in Saskatchewan to switch to one P a g e | 105 centre as illustrated by the case volume for ovarian procedures being less than half of lung resections, yet nine institutions performed such operations as compared to two for lung cancer. A majority of institutions had a case volume less than five per year. Interestingly, the 3-\u00ad\u2010year average mortality rates were higher than the national average for all the procedures, except pancreatic cancer. The median length of stay over the same time period was higher than national average for all procedures, however. Higher travel times for esophagus and pancreatic procedures might be a result of consolidation of such services to a few centres, but same was not true for liver cancer resections. A large number of institutions for ovarian resections could explain shorter travel distances for these procedures in Saskatchewan.

Principal Findings \" The citizen panels highlighted that the regionalization of complex cancer surgeries into regionalized, high-\u00ad\u2010volume centres may be the most promising approach to improving outcomes related to the delivery of care. Indeed, the number of panel members who ranked regionalization as the most important option increased consistently across all three panels from pre-\u00ad\u2010 to post-\u00ad\u2010 deliberations, which suggests an increased strength in their preference for this option as a result of developing a clearer understanding of regionalization through discussions. Figure 6.0 visually demonstrates this trend. Figure 6.0: What is the most favoured option to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries in Canada? \" Panel deliberations revealed that in an optimal situation, patients would receive regionalized surgical cancer care in centres of excellence, yet complete pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010 operative investigations closer to home in either local centres or via telemedicine programs to allow for access with highly trained expertise while minimizing the burden of travel. 23% 14% 9% 9% 15% 17% 29% 21% 27% 9% 62% 83% 57% 79% 64% 82% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Pre-\u00ad\u2010panel Post-\u00ad\u2010panel Pre-\u00ad\u2010panel Post-\u00ad\u2010panel Pre-\u00ad\u2010panel Post-\u00ad\u2010panel Alberta Ontario P.E.I.

Some of the discussed concerns included added burden of travel, a loss of family and community support due to increased distances, and a potential shift of pre-\u00ad\u2010and post-\u00ad\u2010 operative care away from the community. This situation illustrates the importance of support infrastructure, as well as travel distances, in influencing decisions regarding treatment options and where to obtain care. \" Certain institutional level factors were also identified that could hinder the efforts to regionalize surgical care. These include the loss of local expertise, polarization of surgical care structure within a province, difficulties in changing provider behaviour, and complexities associated with developing unanimous guidelines and standards. \" In consideration of aforementioned patient and system-\u00ad\u2010level challenges, it is strongly recommended that policy makers and health care planners be prepared to address various stakeholder perspectives when developing policies for implementing regionalization of complex cancer surgical services. Strengths \" The best available research evidence was paired with a robust deliberative process that provided a voice to the real-\u00ad\u2010world views and experiences of a diverse group of citizens. \" Panel deliberations identified of a set of core values, and a comparison of three options (ranging from quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement strategies to structural changes) that can guide the efforts of health-\u00ad\u2010 system leaders in improving the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. \" Convening the citizen panels in three provinces allowed an examination of views and experiences of citizens residing in provinces with different degrees of consolidation for complex cancer surgeries and access to surgical centres of excellence. Limitations \" The first limitation of our qualitative analysis is that the findings remain exploratory in nature. They are drawn from a small number of sites, which may not reflect the views and experiences of citizens across all Canadian jurisdictions. \" The second limitation is related to the challenges of engaging citizens in in-\u00ad\u2010depth deliberations over a short period of time. This requires intense efforts from panel members to learn from the evidence and from others\u2019 views and experiences, and share their newly informed views about the issue and how to address it. We addressed this limitation to some extent by not aiming for consensus among panel members, but instead to gather a range of perspectives on the topic. Implications for policy \" Regionalization policies were generally supported by citizens in the sampled jurisdictions. While they were more concerned with ensuring that they received the highest quality of care possible despite a potential restriction of local care, the citizens preferred the provision of local services when possible. Therefore, policies should be implemented with an eye for integrating care pathways that utilize local pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010operative care where appropriate and/or high-\u00ad\u2010quality telemedicine systems to increase access to care. P a g e | 108 6.1 OBJECTIVES Quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement strategies that focus on the process of care and structural changes to health systems may have important implications for the experiences of patients and their families. One approach to explore such issues is to convene a citizen panel bringing together 10-\u00ad\u201014 citizens from all walks of life. Panel members, informed by a pre-\u00ad\u2010circulated citizen brief, share their ideas and experiences on an issue, and learn from research evidence and from the views of others. The deliberations of a citizen panel can reveal new understandings about an issue and spark insights about how it should be addressed. To foster such efforts, the McMaster Health Forum (www.mcmasterhealthforum.org) convened a citizen panel in each of three Canadian jurisdictions to deliberate about how to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. In this section, we highlight the views and experiences of panel members about the problem, three options (among many) to address the problem, and barriers and facilitators to implementing the options. In particular, we examined areas of common ground and differences of opinions among panel members and (where possible) identify the values underlying different positions. The study protocol was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board at McMaster University and all panel members provided voluntary, informed consent. Further details on participant recruitment are presented in Appendix 6. The main objective of this section is to provide insights into the citizen\u2019s preferences in organization of cancer surgical care, along with the debate addressing the potential challenges in access to quality care. This information can inform policymakers and health care administrators regarding citizen\u2019s perspective on access to care, travel challenges, and potential approaches to improve quality of cancer surgical care. The features of the problem and a summary of the factors contributing to the problem are outlined in Appendix 7, as well as the three options are summarized in Appendix 8. 6.2 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS An overarching qualitative approach was used to synthesize the key themes that emerged from the face-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010face deliberations. This approach was combined with pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010event questionnaires to document participants\u2019 views regarding different facets of the problem, as well as three proposed options) to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. The deliberations were recorded and non-\u00ad\u2010participant observers took extensive notes. The recordings and notes were used to draft summaries for each panel that highlighted the views and experiences of panel members, along with values-\u00ad\u2010related themes that emerged during the deliberations. Pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010meeting questionnaires were developed by the research team to assess the relative importance, assigned by panel members before and after the deliberations, to the three options for addressing the problem of shortfalls with the delivery of complex cancer surgeries in Canada. Questions were also included about P a g e | 109 participants\u2019 preferred location for undergoing complex cancer surgery, the importance of travel distance to their decision to have the surgery or not, and concerns about having to travel a long distance to undergo complex cancer surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data collected from the questionnaires. The participant profiles are summarized in Appendix 9. 6.3 MAIN FINDINGS The summary of the key themes that emerged during the deliberations of the three citizen panels are presented below, with a specific focus on their views and experiences regarding: 1) the problem; 2) three potentially viable options (among many) to address the problem; and 3) the implementation considerations. The section concludes with an examination of results from the pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010questionnaires. The problem \u2013 why is it challenging to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries? All three panels discussed at great length the challenges of making an informed decision in the midst of a cancer diagnosis. The panel members highlighted six key challenges with some consistency, which represented deeper reflections on the features of the problem presented in the brief based on their experiences and values (see Table 6.1 below). TABLE 6.1: KEY FEATURES OF THE PROBLEM OF DELIVERING COMPLEX CANCER SURGERIES (AND ITS CAUSES) ACCORDING TO PANEL MEMBERS Panel members highlighted six key challenges with some consistency: 1. Making decisions in the midst of a cancer diagnosis is difficult; 2. Inequities exist in access to optimal surgical care, as well as palliative care and system-\u00ad\u2010level support; 3. Patients and their informal/family caregivers lack support; 4. The cancer patient journey is marked by care coordination problems (e.g., communication breakdowns with and between healthcare providers, and out-\u00ad\u2010of-\u00ad\u2010province care processes being complex and not optimally coordinated); 5. Current financial arrangements (i.e., global budgets for hospitals) limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries; and 6. Governance arrangements (e.g., lack of regulation for hospitals and surgeons, and lack of arrangements to optimally address cross-\u00ad\u2010jurisdictional issues) limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. 1) It is difficult to make an informed decision in the midst of a cancer diagnosis Participants generally agreed that a cancer diagnosis triggers very emotional reactions, which affect the capacity of patients and families to make decisions. They also pointed out the rapid pace at which decisions must be made, often without complete information (e.g., information about their condition, the full scope of treatment options, and the availability of P a g e | 110 high-\u00ad\u2010quality surgical and post-\u00ad\u2010operative care) and without the support needed to make these decisions, which nurtured uncertainty about which course of action to take. As one Ontario panel member said: \u201c[you must make] rushed decisions that could mean life and death.\u201d Participants also emphasized that such decisions are made more challenging for patients and families from rural and remote areas (as well as those from provinces where such surgeries are not performed) because they have to weigh the significant emotional, financial and practical implications of traveling far away from home to undergo lengthy and complex surgical procedures against the potential benefits. 2) Inequities exist in access to optimal surgical care, palliative care, and other system-\u00ad\u2010level support All three panels discussed inequities of access to optimal surgical care, and in some instances inequities of access to palliative care, and other system-\u00ad\u2010level support. Several participants from the Ontario and Alberta panels acknowledged that they were lucky to live near a regional centre of excellence for cancer (in Hamilton or Edmonton), but they also agreed that many people living in rural and remote areas could face very difficult decisions. Some examples included decision regarding whether to choose a treatment option offered at a hospital close to home (and potentially undergoing surgery in a local, low-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital), or travelling far away from home to receive the surgery at a high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital with a concentration of expertise (with the hope of better outcomes). A few participants pointed out that these inequities had been an ongoing issue given the vast Canadian landscape and its low-\u00ad\u2010density population, which require that many patients travel to obtain specialized care only available in urban centres. However, they emphasized that it was essential to collectively find ways to overcome all the barriers that may restrict access to care and to alleviate the burden on patients and families who must travel. 3) Patients and their informal/family caregivers lack support Several panel members indicated that patients and their informal/family caregivers lack support. They emphasized the crucial role that caregivers play along the cancer journey. As one panel member from Alberta indicated: \u201cIt is a daunting journey. If I didn\u2019t have people helping me, I would say forget it [undergoing complex cancer surgery].\u201d A second panel member from Alberta emphasized that: \u201cAs Canadians, we deserve the right to have the proper support system in place when going through cancer.\u201d This issue was also discussed at great length among PEI panel members. Given the need to travel long distances for specialist care, and the lack of supports on the island for both pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010 operative care, several panel members noted that it was the informal caregivers who played the most significant support role. Yet, many informal and family caregivers faced many challenges in their roles, particularly those with lower incomes and those living in remote and northern communities who must travel to urban centres to accompany their loved ones undergoing complex cancer surgeries. Participants from all three panels called for greater P a g e | 111 financial support to alleviate the burden on caregivers, who can face significant out-\u00ad\u2010of-\u00ad\u2010 pocket expenses, as well as greater practical support, including accommodations like the Ronald McDonald Houses that provide a \u2018home away from home.\u2019 4) The cancer patient journey is marked by care coordination problems Several panel members emphasized that the cancer patient journey is marked by care coordination problems. For instance, a few Ontario panel members experienced difficult interactions with their family physicians and specialists about their initial symptoms, which may have delayed their cancer diagnosis. Other Ontario panel members provided examples of communication lapses between the regional cancer centre and their local Community Care Access Centre (i.e., local agencies that have responsibility for connecting people with the care they need at home and in their communities), which affected the coordination of post-\u00ad\u2010operative care. As one Ontario panel member indicated: \u201cWhen patients leave the hospital, there is a risk of getting into a void.\u201d Such coordination problems were particularly salient among PEI panel members, who highlighted that having to travel out-\u00ad\u2010of-\u00ad\u2010 province to undergo complex cancer surgery can complicate the process of care, which is then often poorly coordinated. In addition, they emphasized that that most residents of PEI were \u201cblind to the way the system works [on the island].\u201d Thus, they face challenges in getting information related to how the system works, their likely care pathway, and the supports available to them. 5) Current financial arrangements may limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries All three panels talked to a lesser extent about how current financial arrangements may limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. While some participants were generally concerned about the rising costs associated with cancer care and the overall financial sustainability of the health system, others expressed concern that the predominant funding model for hospitals (i.e., global budgets) may not create incentives for hospitals to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries, or to increase surgical volumes for certain complex cancer surgeries. PEI panel members were particularly worried that global hospital budgets may create disincentives for providers in other provinces to take on patients requiring complex cancer surgeries from their province, as they could be more expensive to treat. 6) Existing governance arrangements may limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries All three panels also talked (albeit to a lesser extent) about how current governance arrangements may limit our capacity to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. Ontario and Alberta panel members both expressed concern about the minimal regulation regarding which procedures surgeons can perform within their specialty area, or how P a g e | 112 frequently they need to perform these procedures to ensure their surgical skills remain up to date. They were similarly concerned about the lack of regulation about which surgical procedures hospitals can perform or how frequently they need to perform them to ensure that quality remains high. One panel member from Alberta indicated that there was a need to raise public awareness about this. \u201cThat scares me. It is very scary and Canadians need to pay attention to that.\u201d Other participants were also concerned that \u2018solo\u2019 surgeons could be allowed to perform these high-\u00ad\u2010risk and resource-\u00ad\u2010intensive cancer surgeries in low-\u00ad\u2010volume hospitals. PEI panel members focused, for instance, on the absence of explicit mechanisms to ensure that the patients referred out of province receive the highest quality care possible in a timely way. PEI panel members also argued that one of the main issues underpinning these challenges was the complex political context. In particular, the dynamics of Canada\u2019s federalist structure of government and interprovincial politics were thought to complicate the situation, blurring lines of accountability and making it challenging to pursue changes to the status quo in a consolidated and coordinated way. Participants were asked to rank each of the options based on preferences after considering their personal beliefs and values. Figure 6.1 summarizes the values associated with each of the options. Regionalizing complex cancer surgeries into designated surgical centres of excellence was ranked number one by a vast majority of participants in all three panels, both before and after the deliberations. This number one ranking increased consistently across all three panels over the pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010panel period, which indicates that as participants learned more about regionalization, their strength of preference increased as a result. The implementation of province-\u00ad\u2010wide quality improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided was most often ranked second in the Ontario and Edmonton panels (both before and after deliberations), but PEI participants ranked this option third before the deliberations and then second after the deliberations. Lastly, the concept of encouraging the local adoption of quality improvement initiatives in order to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided was most often ranked third in the Ontario and Edmonton panels (both before and after deliberations), but PEI participants ranked this option second before the deliberations and then third after the deliberations. It is quite likely that this decrease in the strength of preference for this option is as a result of the education process facilitated by the deliberations. The options \u2013 how can we address the problem? After discussing the challenges that reflect or contribute to shortfalls in the delivery of complex cancer surgeries in Canada, participants discussed three options (among many) for making improvements (see Appendix 8 for a detailed description of each option). In this section, we briefly describe the views of panel members regarding each option and (where P a g e | 113 possible) identify the values underlying different positions. Table 6.2 presents a summary of the value-\u00ad\u2010related themes that emerged for each option. Option 1 -\u00ad\u2010 Encourage the local adoption of quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided While participants from all three panels acknowledged that this option was aimed to continuously improve the local delivery of complex cancer surgeries, and potentially local care processes, most of them agreed that the inherent challenges and drawbacks associated with this option made it the least promising among the three considered to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. When discussing the limitations of option 1, three values-\u00ad\u2010related themes emerged with some consistency: \u2022 Stewardship -\u00ad\u2010 All three panels indicated that this option may lack the clear direction and incentives needed to implement quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives. Most panel members saw this option as a \u2018weak\u2019 approach to improving the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. As a panel member from Ontario illustrated: \u201cIt\u2019s like telling a child, \u2018please be good\u2019.\u201d A panel member from Edmonton emphasized that without proper stewardship, local quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives will be \u201cmoving targets that could be easily side-\u00ad\u2010tracked.\u201d \u2022 Policies based on data and evidence -\u00ad\u2010 The Alberta and Ontario panels pointed out that this option may lead to policies that are not aligned with what is known about the relationship between surgical volumes and outcomes. An Ontario panel member indicated that trying to provide full access to these complex cancer surgeries in all hospitals was impossible. \u201cFull access and fairness, it\u2019s a utopia. Until we reach population density allowing that, [it will not be possible].\u201d \u2022 Excellent health outcomes -\u00ad\u2010 The Alberta and Ontario panels suggested that this option may improve the local delivery of care, but not necessarily improve patient outcomes. Ontario panel members emphasized the lack of available expertise for these complex cancer surgeries. As one panel member pointed out: \u201cThere is a lack of expertise to go around.\u201d Thus, implementing this option does not solve the problem of not having enough surgeons and health care providers available to achieve excellent health outcomes in all hospitals.\nA few other values-\u00ad\u2010related themes emerged in some panels that may explain the reluctance of participants to support this option: \u2022 Choice -\u00ad\u2010 The Ontario panel pointed out that while this option may allow patients to choose local treatment options, it may not allow them to choose the most optimal treatment option (i.e., going to a high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital).\nP a g e | 114 \u2022 Cost-\u00ad\u2010effectiveness -\u00ad\u2010 The Ontario panel indicated that this option may not make the best use of the limited financial resources and expertise available. \u2022 Collaboration -\u00ad\u2010 The Ontario panel highlighted that this option, by focusing efforts on local hospitals, may increase fragmentation within the system. \u2022 Sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 The PEI panel emphasized that there may be a lack the resources in small provinces like theirs to implement and sustain locally driven quality-\u00ad\u2010 improvement initiatives. Option 2 -\u00ad\u2010 Implement province-\u00ad\u2010wide quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided Participants in all three panels generally agreed that this option was preferred to the previous one, although significant challenges still existed. Several values-\u00ad\u2010related themes highlighted the potential benefits of province-\u00ad\u2010wide quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives, which include but are not limited to: \u2022 Continuously improve -\u00ad\u2010 This option may support province-\u00ad\u2010wide continuous-\u00ad\u2010 improvement efforts, facilitate the dissemination and uptake of successful local initiatives across the province, but also facilitate patient coordination across jurisdictions. \u2022 Stewardship -\u00ad\u2010 This may provide the necessary direction and incentives to implement these local quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives. \u2022 Accountability -\u00ad\u2010 This option may increase public accountability by requiring public reporting of surgeons\u2019 and hospitals\u2019 performance, and establishing clear provincial benchmarks. \u2022 Fairness -\u00ad\u2010 This option may standardize the quality of care across the province, and could be extended to include the development of pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian guidelines and standards to ensure that all Canadians have access to optimal surgical care. \u2022 Excellent patient and family experience \u2013 This option may ensure that care pathways are more attuned to the needs of patients and families who must travel outside the province to undergo surgery. However, when discussing the limitations of this option, two values-\u00ad\u2010related themes emerged with some consistency: \u2022 Fairness -\u00ad\u2010 Some elements of this option, more specifically implementing pay-\u00ad\u2010for-\u00ad\u2010 performance for hospitals and establishing requirements for reporting to the public about quality indicators and other performance measures, may have some unintended consequences. Several participants expressed concerns that such quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives could lead providers and hospitals to \u2018cherry-\u00ad\u2010pick\u2019 patients who may help them score well, or to avoid those who may cause them to P a g e | 115 score poorly, in order to make their statistics look better. As one panel member from Alberta said: \u201cI have concerns that [they wouldn\u2019t] want to take people like me because the success rate is not there. My chances of my survival are not high.\u201d \u2022 Excellent health outcomes -\u00ad\u2010 By not making structural changes, the impact of this option would most likely be limited in improving patient outcomes. Overall, this option generally resonated the most with participants in all three panels and was identified as the one more likely to significantly improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. Several values-\u00ad\u2010related themes highlighted the potential benefits of regionalization, which include but are not limited to: \u2022 Continuously improve -\u00ad\u2010 This option may yield continuous improvements in the quality of both surgical and post-\u00ad\u2010operative care. \u2022 Excellent health outcomes -\u00ad\u2010 This option is more likely to improve patient outcomes. \u2022 Policies based on data and evidence -\u00ad\u2010 This option may lead to policies that are aligned with what is known about the relationship between surgical volumes and outcomes. \u2022 Cost-\u00ad\u2010effectiveness -\u00ad\u2010 This option could make, as a panel member from Alberta said, the most \u201ccost-\u00ad\u2010effective use of trained personnel.\u201d \u2022 Expertise -\u00ad\u2010 This option may create a concentration of highly skilled surgeons and health care providers to deliver these very complex and high-\u00ad\u2010risk surgical procedures. \u2022 Safety -\u00ad\u2010 This option may offer safer surgical care by having a critical mass of highly-\u00ad\u2010 trained personnel who can support complex cancer surgeries. \u2022 Innovation -\u00ad\u2010 This option offers an environment more likely to facilitate or trigger innovation. While regionalization resonated the most with panel members, it still generated some concerns that were embodied in the following values-\u00ad\u2010related themes: \u2022 Excellent patient-\u00ad\u2010 and family-\u00ad\u2010experience \u2013 Regionalizing complex cancer surgeries should not neglect that care must be attuned to the values, needs and preferences of patients and families. As a panel member from Alberta said: \u201c[regionalization] needs to be looked at in a holistic way, with the family taken into consideration.\u201d In addition, regionalization must be attuned to the unique aspects of different cancer care pathways. PEI panel members highlighted that not all cancers are the same, meaning that regionalization across the full spectrum of care Option 3 \u2013 Regionalize complex cancer surgeries into designated surgical centres of excellence P a g e | 116 (pre-\u00ad\u2010operative care to surgical care to post-\u00ad\u2010operative care) should not be considered a \u2018one-\u00ad\u2010size fits all\u2019 approach. \u2022 Fairness \u2013 Regionalizing complex cancer surgeries should not create additional barriers to accessing optimal surgical care and should include interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of traveling to undergo complex cancer surgery in a regional surgical centre of excellence. \u2022 Adaptability \u2013 The health system should provide flexible care pathways that allow every patient to receive optimal surgical care in a regional centre of excellence, with the remaining care provided locally. \u2022 Proximity \u2013 While the regionalization of complex cancer surgeries may be the most optimal way forward, panel members still greatly valued receiving cancer care close to home whenever possible. These concerns led several panel members to propose enhancements to the third option. More specifically, PEI panel members proposed three additional features: \u2022 Implementing local post-\u00ad\u2010care recovery centres \u2013 PEI panel members emphasized the importance of balancing regionalized surgical care with strong, local post-\u00ad\u2010operative care. These panel members acknowledged that the island (along with other regions across Canada) may not have the capacity to implement surgical centres of excellence, but they proposed the implementation of local post-\u00ad\u2010care recovery centres of excellence. \u2022 Introducing telemedicine initiatives \u2013 PEI panel members called for effective use of advances in telemedicine or other technologies that enable remote consultations and thus reduce the burden associated with travelling to a regional centre of excellence for routine consultations. \u2022 Increasing the role of \u2018patient navigators\u2019 \u2013 PEI panel members called for a greater role of \u2018patient navigators\u2019 who can provide support and coordination for patients and their informal/family caregivers throughout the entire care pathway (especially in the context of those who must travel to undergo complex cancer surgery). Ontario panel members went further and proposed a fourth, stand-\u00ad\u2010alone option: introducing flexible care pathways, whereby every patient could receive optimal surgical care in a regional centre of excellence, but with the remaining care provided close to home whenever possible. This option resonated with the proposal from PEI panel members who emphasized the importance of balancing regionalized surgical care with strong, local post-\u00ad\u2010 operative care. Indeed, several Ontario panel members were hesitant about the full-\u00ad\u2010blown regionalization of cancer care, especially given the significant burden that it would put on the shoulders of patients and families from rural and remote communities. These participants indicated that regionalization might be a good option for the surgeries, which have a high risk of complications, are resource intensive, and require highly skilled P a g e | 117 surgeons and providers. However, they questioned whether all aspects of cancer care needed to be regionalized (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and ancillary cancer care) and proposed the development of more flexible care pathways, with the surgery being regionalized, but other cancer care being offered locally whenever possible. This would ensure that patients and families are close to home for as long as possible during the cancer journey, which was perceived as an environment more favourable to recovery. The implementation considerations- What are concerns with regard to regionalizing care? After discussing the options for improving the delivery of complex cancer surgeries in Canada, participants examined potential barriers and facilitators for moving forward. These can be classified as either institutional/government level considerations or patient-\u00ad\u2010impact related concerns. Institutional-\u00ad\u2010level concerns of the implementation of regionalization In general, five broad groupings of health care system institutional barriers emerged during deliberations: 1. The public resistance to regionalization if it leads to a loss of local expertise or if the regionalization model is based on only the a very limited number of \u2018poles\u2019 (i.e., centres of expertise) in each province 2. The difficulties in changing provider behavior and organizational culture to embrace quality improvement (and the long time required to assess the full impact of these options, which could fuel resistance towards such quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement efforts) 3. The lack of human and financial resources to achieve desired changes in the system (e.g., developing a critical mass of highly skilled surgeons and health care providers to meet the demands for complex cancer surgeries or having the financial resources to implement new and sustainable regional infrastructures) 4. The complexity of developing commonly agreed provincial standards and regional infrastructures, which could face a \u2018push back\u2019 from certain health-\u00ad\u2010system stakeholders 5. The separation of powers between provinces that exists given Canada\u2019s federalist structure, which makes it difficult to coordinate health services across jurisdictions (a barrier particularly salient for those living in provinces and territories that are not providing complex cancer surgeries) When considering potential facilitators for overcoming these barriers and moving forward with implementing regionalization, participants from all three panels emphasized the opportunity of building on positive things already happening in the health system as a foundation for future efforts. In Alberta and Ontario, panel participants highlighted current efforts to regionalize certain complex cancer surgeries and to establish province-\u00ad\u2010wide standards. As for participants in PEI, many acknowledged the reality was that it probably P a g e | 118 TABLE 6.2.

Given this reality, participants were more accepting of the current situation in which much of this care is regionalized to centres of excellence in other Atlantic provinces. As such, efforts to improve the existing processes of care within and outside of PEI, rather than make major structural changes to the existing system, were seen as possible. An additional barrier not noted in the deliberations is that of surgeon willingness to adopt new practices or to modify existing ones in order to enact change. Regionalization requires that surgeons accept the evidence that higher volume centres tend to result in better outcomes, and to be willing to change practice patterns in order to benefit their patients. A designated, well-\u00ad\u2010placed opinion leader within the community of practice can champion regionalization policies within a province to minimize the effect of this barrier to change. Patient-\u00ad\u2010level concerns of the implementation of regionalization Participants were also asked to consider the impact of regionalization on their personal experience with the health care system when accessing surgical cancer services. They were also asked to consider whether these concerns would then affect their preference for regionalization, although the preference for surgical centres of excellence endured. 1) Travel time Speaking to the known increase in travel times due to the regionalization of cancer services as demonstrated in the mapping presented earlier in this report, panel members were asked to explore the trade-\u00ad\u2010offs, preferences and concerns associated with travel to undergo complex cancer surgeries through three questions. First, panel members were asked whether they would prefer to undergo complex cancer surgery at a hospital close to their home, even if that hospital did not have a lot of experience performing the type of surgery that they needed (i.e., it was a low-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital) or at a hospital where many of these types of surgeries are performed (i.e., a high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital), even if that meant they would need to travel far away from home to receive the surgery and for related medical appointments before and after the surgery. The majority of participants in all three panels indicated a preference to have surgery at a high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital even if that meant they would need to travel far away from home to receive the surgery and for related medical appointments before and after the surgery. On the whole, these views changed very little following the panel deliberations (see Figure 6.1) and resonated with the general tenor of discussions, which emphasized participants\u2019 willingness to do everything possible to access a high-\u00ad\u2010volume centre, even if it required travelling to another region. Although willingness to travel to get the best care possible was a dominant theme, at least one panel participant (from Ontario) viewed the burden to be too great. This person clearly indicated that, whatever the cancer diagnosis and treatment options available, she would P a g e | 120 always choose local treatment options and \u201chope for the best\u201d, because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t put that burden [of travelling to get surgical care]\u201d on her family. Thus, personal and familial circumstances are also important factors that will influence decisions regarding treatment options and where to obtain care. This difference in opinion was stable across the pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010panel questionnaires, suggesting that there will always be a small proportion who will favour local delivery despite downsides. We also asked panel members how important the distance to travel would be to making the decision to have surgery or not, on a scale of 1 (very unimportant) to 7 (very important). In general, panel members from Ontario and Alberta found that the travel distance was slightly more important than PEI panel members (see Table 6.3). This result likely reflects the reality for PEI residents that they must travel to neighbouring provinces to obtain health care services not available locally. These concerns would manifest more often after regionalization of cancer care services, and should be taken into consideration when making catchment area decisions at the health care planning levels.

Being able to receive good post-\u00ad\u2010operative care once they go back home emerged as the most important concerns in all three panels (both pre-\u00ad\u2010 and post-\u00ad\u2010deliberations in Ontario and Alberta, and post-\u00ad\u2010 deliberations in PEI). Other sources of concerns that emerged include being able to cover travel costs, being away from family and friends and safety concerns (see Figure 6.2).

Several of these values clearly suggest that any quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiative or structural change should pay close attention to its impact on patients and families. Indeed, panel deliberations indicated that interventions must be put in place to provide enhanced support for patients and families throughout their cancer journey, and especially to overcome barriers to access optimal surgical care. In addition, participants from all three panels emphasized the opportunity of building on positive things already happening in the health system as a foundation for future efforts, including current efforts to regionalize certain complex cancer surgeries and to establish province-\u00ad\u2010wide standards. Panel deliberations also suggest the need to develop governance arrangements that are favourable to support coordination across jurisdictions, which are essential to supporting patients and families residing in a province or territory where complex cancer surgeries are not available. P a g e | 123 7.0: SUMMARY AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS The high burden of disease associated with cancer on both the healthcare system and patients presses the need for novel quality improvement initiatives to improve outcomes of surgical cancer care. This report summarized the pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian current state of surgical cancer care for high-\u00ad\u2010risk, resource intensive surgery for esophageal, pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancers. The findings observed a significant variability in outcomes between provinces and heterogeneous approaches to healthcare system organization and oversight. There has been very little progress on the implementation of active regionalization nationally, despite evidence indicating that regionalization policies can help create an environment for quality improvement. Lastly, the report established that patients are willing to accept the increased travel time to surgical cancer care and apparent loss of local resources if it means that they can expect improved outcomes. This evidence provides support to the implementation of regionalization on a broader scale. While further study is required, we recommend that provinces consider thoughtfully implementing regionalization policies in ways that best serve the needs of their population and by doing so, improving the overall quality of patient care and health care system efficiency. Evaluating the present state of regionalization and surgical cancer care outcomes is challenging. The impacts of regionalization will be different for each surgery type, due partially to the difference in associated risks and frequency of procedures. Some cancers are diagnosed later in life and the proportion of resectable cases is low. Since there are no prospective disease-\u00ad\u2010specific registries in Canada to date, the breadth of the available data for review was limited beyond mortality, length of stay, and resection rates. There are a number of \u2018soft\u2019 outcomes of interest such as complications, the number of salvage procedures, rates of readmission that could help inform the quality of surgical cancer care, but we could not measure this given the data limitations in this report. We do expect to see an improvement in such outcomes with regionalization as well. Despite these limitations, the potential impact of regionalization to high volume centres remains evident and the evidence can only be strengthened through the establishment of systematic data collection with formalized reporting along with national, disease-\u00ad\u2010specific standards of care so that one regionalized centre is comparable to another. While challenges are to be expected with implementing any sort of quality improvement program, establishing a program that requires such considerable coordination between P a g e | 124 multiple levels of the health care system, communities and citizens is likely to face barriers along the way. It will require a strong coordinated effort to create a change that considers the consequences and develops innovative approaches that overcome the perceived barriers in order to realize the potential benefits to care for Canadians. This report concludes with a series of recommendations that will assist policy makers, health care planners, opinion leaders within the surgical communities of practice and administrators with working towards the desired future state of active regionalization. A common theme noted during the provincial expert interviews was that there is a distinct lack of leadership for surgical cancer services. In medical and radiation oncology, there is often an appointed Lead who is responsible for directing the implementation of clinical guidelines, manpower allocation, advocacy at policymaker and budget allocation tables and finally the ability to facilitate quality assurance initiatives. In most provinces, there is no such role for the surgical portion of the cancer treatment process, despite the fact that surgery is associated with better survival. The role should be created and filled by a key opinion leader within the surgical cancer community in each province, with a clearly defined mandate and objectives. This common role across the provinces will allow provinces to have the flexibility to integrate this position into their existing cancer care organization schemes while still maintaining the central purpose of the role. The intent of this recommendation is to facilitate a formal leadership position in each province that will allow initiatives such as regionalization, quality improvement reporting and the development and uptake of clinical guidelines to gain traction and proceed to implementation. It is important to differentiate between passive consolidation of health care services to centralized locations and active regionalization approaches that encompass a range of quality improvement initiatives in addition to amassing larger volumes. The quantitative analysis undertaken in this report indicates that higher volume centres are associated with improvements in patient mortality rates after resections, yet volume alone is not wholly responsible for these improvements. Even in the highest volume centres, the introduction of evidence-\u00ad\u2010based surgical standards and clinical pathways, the utilization of dedicated, trained staff training or the adoption of optimal Recommendation #1: Surgical cancer care should be integrated into the overall spectrum of provincial cancer services with the capacity for establishing systematic evaluation and the provision of sufficient resources to enact change Recommendation #2: Purposeful regionalization of cancer surgical services above and beyond simple consolidation is necessary to improve health care quality and patient outcomes P a g e | 125 surgical techniques have the potential to further reduce mortality. Regionalized, higher-\u00ad\u2010 volume centres are more likely to possess the infrastructure and manpower to provide multidisciplinary care, a key quality standard indicated by clinical guidelines released by organizations such as the American National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)167,168 and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)169,170 for thoracic malignancies and by NCCN for hepatobiliarypancreatic cancers171.172. Lastly, feedback obtained via the citizen panel work undertaken for this report indicated that the public is willing to trade off a certain degree of convenience for optimal outcomes. This provides the justification needed on a user-\u00ad\u2010basis to support the regionalization of surgical cancer services. The intent of this recommendation is promote the adoption of active regionalization on a provincial basis, as it has shown promise as a good approach to improve the quality of surgical cancer services that is also palatable to patients and the general public. During the course of consultations with experts across the country, it was very clear that each province has unique needs that will impact the implementation of quality improvement policies within existing health care system organization. Each province possesses different healthcare system governance and oversight structures, geographic realities, and access to care expectations that shape how policies can be implemented. This is best demonstrated by the case of Prince Edward Island, where complex surgeries are often referred to neighbouring provinces. This policy certainly limits access to care, but the low population of this province means that meaningful volumes could never be met. In order for residents of PEI to realize the benefit of regionalization policies, this population would be best suited to continue to be referred to other provinces for complex care. Since no one province shares similar infrastructure with another, it is not feasible to establish a single, national regionalization policy. Regardless, the volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome effect should be considered when allocating surgical centres of excellence where appropriate. Similarly, while it would be ideal to be able to define a threshold for each cancer type to be incorporated into provincial regionalization policies, the relative difference in provincial populations means that it would be truly impractical to recommend a single volume cut-\u00ad\u2010off. The intent of this recommendation is not enforce a single, national policy for regionalization activities, but to instead acknowledge that each province should integrate this policy into their current organizational infrastructure. Each province should be responsible for initiating a dialogue within each community of practice, led by the Surgical Recommendation #3: Regionalization policies should be tailored to meet unique provincial needs P a g e | 126 Cancer Care Lead, to establish provincial needs and to define reasonable volume standards that consider population distribution and available resources. A primary concern of patients contemplating undergoing surgical cancer care in regionalized centres of excellence is that some patients would be removed from their communities and support networks and would face longer travel times to access care. Over the course of the citizen panel discussions, participants indicated that innovative healthcare delivery approaches can help overcome the burden of reduced access to care that may come with adopting regionalization policies. These approaches can take the form of the development of collaborations with local institutions in smaller centres with oversight and direction from the regional centre, where patients can attend for diagnostic assessment programs, clinical testing or post-\u00ad\u2010surgical examinations closer to home while still realizing the benefits of regionalized care. Alternately, telemedicine may be utilized, where patients can present at their local healthcare facility for a consultation with their surgeon and care team at the regional centre. The objective of these adapted approaches would be to allow patients to minimize costs and travel while still receiving high quality care. The intent of this recommendation is to encourage provinces considering the implementation of regionalization to seek innovative approaches that will allow patients to see the benefits of such quality improvement programs while also ameliorating the impact on patients and their families. This flexibility is intended to promote implementation given the different provincial realities. The volume-\u00ad\u2010outcome relationship has a significant impact on patient mortality and likely other less concrete outcomes, but does not account for all the improvements in outcomes. Regionalized centres will naturally have a higher volume of patients than they would have in a non-\u00ad\u2010regionalized setting, but there are other quality factors such as highly trained personnel, the creation of specialized surgical stepdown units or the hiring of sufficiently trained surgeons among many other possibilities. One such approach to ensuring a degree of uniformity as to what defines a regionalized centre would be to develop nationally-\u00ad\u2010 implemented standards of care specific to each cancer type. Each specialty-\u00ad\u2010based Recommendation #4: Surgical cancer care should embrace flexible implementation of regionalization policies based on access to care concerns and patient preferences Recommendation #5: Nationally-\u00ad\u2010implemented standards of care should be developed for each cancer surgery type P a g e | 127 community of practice should be charged with defining minimal standards for practitioner certification or training to ensure only highly trained surgeons are undertaking these complex resections, the use of multi-\u00ad\u2010disciplinary cancer conferences to ensure the most appropriate care is selected for patients, the establishment of minimal institutional and/or surgeon case volumes to guide policy decision making, and the mandatory participation of centres in national quality improvement registries to facilitate the evaluation of regionalization efforts. The standards should also consider the integration of specialized nursing, critical care and anaesthesia services, and adequate radiology and pathology service support to ensure that the appropriate personnel and infrastructure are in place to deliver care according to clinical guidelines. These standards need to be evidence-\u00ad\u2010based using current research, similar to those that have been developed internationally, to encourage the uptake of best practices on both provincial and national levels. The adoption of standards nationally will also help to address the disparities in patient outcomes noted between the provinces, both by establishing what constitutes quality care, but also by allowing outcomes to be compared between institutions in different provinces to better define success. Without defined national standards of care, there is too much inherent variability in care practices. The evaluation of adherence to these surgical standards of care should be integrated into existing national evaluation structures in order to measure province-\u00ad\u2010level improvements and inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial variance. The intent of this recommendation is for national-\u00ad\u2010level specialty communities of care to review existing evidence and to undergo a consensus generating exercise to establish suitable informed standards of care centred on regionalizing surgical cancer care services. These standards are then intended to be applied in each province, with regular auditing for compliance and quality improvement. When specialty-\u00ad\u2010based communities of care are asked to establish nationally-\u00ad\u2010defined standards of care, it is expected that standardized data collection with explicit public reporting will be a key component to measure the impact of regionalization policies. As per the defined standards of care, all surgical care providers should be expected to participate in these national disease-\u00ad\u2010specific registries. The utilization of registries with formal reporting procedures can improve the quality of patient care independently of other interventions, as observed with the American College of Surgeons\u2019 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). This program utilizes systematic data collection and reporting for patients undergoing surgery for any indication, and has reported reduced mortality and morbidity variability by 9% and 30%, respectively173. While there is apparent value to generic databases, considerably more valuable information can be Recommendation #6: A structured benchmarking process for each specialty should be supported to improve surgical outcomes and inform policy decisions P a g e | 128 derived from disease-\u00ad\u2010specific registries that capture a standardized core dataset consisting of patient demographics and risk factors, cancer and procedure-\u00ad\u2010specific details and eventual outcomes, including surgery-\u00ad\u2010related adverse events and oncologic outcomes. The richness of this data will allow for a valid evaluation of improvements in patient outcomes and reductions in inter-\u00ad\u2010provincial variability as a result of volume intensification and the establishment of standards of care. It is necessary for each community of practice to define and standardize these data fields to ensure that data collection is clinically relevant and that the results can be compared between institutions. The standardization of data collection across sites will allow surgeons and institutions to be benchmarked against their peers with trends tracked overtime both within and between participants. This continuous monitoring facilitates the detection of poor outcomes, informing decision makers and health care planners of areas requiring additional attention or resources. Such monitoring also has the potential to allow for the creation and dissemination of best practices, where institutions with excellent outcomes can share innovative strategies with other institutions, resulting in a system-\u00ad\u2010wide improvement in outcomes according to the principles of positive deviance. Finally, the collection and monitoring of surgical data encourages surgeon accountability to evidence-\u00ad\u2010 based guidelines and the established standards of care. The recommendations of this report were selected as they indicate important factors that are missing in the present state of surgical cancer care across Canada, leading to large gaps in knowledge and inconsistencies in surgical cancer care delivery. Provinces implementing active regionalization should consider these recommendations starting from the policy development stages and continuing through to ongoing evaluation and monitoring. Ideally, adoption of a nationally standardized, provincially implemented approach to regionalization will place Canada as a world leader in quality surgical cancer care for high-\u00ad\u2010 risk, complex cancer surgery.

Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), which contains hospital records for in-\u00ad\u2010 patient admissions. Except for liver cancer, only cases with primary cancers and associated surgical procedure(s) over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period (2004-\u00ad\u20102012) were included in this analysis (See Appendix 2 ICD-\u00ad\u201010 diagnosis codes). Resections for primary liver cancer constitute one-\u00ad\u2010third of all liver procedures, while the remaining procedures are performed for metastasized colorectal tumours. The expert surgeons identified high risk procedures within each cancer type. A list of ICD-\u00ad\u201010 procedure codes used for this analysis is presented in Appendix 2. The outcomes of interest were in-\u00ad\u2010hospital mortality at discharge, and length of hospital stay for those discharged alive, up to a maximum of 30 days. The exclusion of patients who experienced a length of stay beyond thirty days was selected because those patients would typically be more complicated case, and are not representative of the usual patient population. The crude mortality rates, averaged over the 9 year period, are presented as the simplistic representation of mortality rates over time in Canada. The low annual case volume for smaller provinces makes direct year-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010 year comparisons between provinces challenging. For instance, the crude mortality rate for a province with annual case load of 20 surgeries can increase from 0% to 5% with one instance of in-\u00ad\u2010 hospital mortality. Therefore, 9-\u00ad\u2010year age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted mortality rates (using the Canadian population over the 9-\u00ad\u2010year period as a standard) are presented for each province to facilitate more fair comparisons. \u2022 Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to quantify the impact of patient-\u00ad\u2010 related factors (age, sex, and co-\u00ad\u2010morbidities), procedural complexities, year, and system-\u00ad\u2010 specific factors (hospital volume, surgeon volume, surgeon specialty) on outcomes of interest. Hospital volume was used as a primary surrogate measure to assess the extent of consolidation of services since surgeon specialty is not reliably coded in administrative databases and accurate surgeon volume counts are obscured by instances of reused surgeon identification codes in multiple centres. \u2022 The population size, and hence the number of surgeries, differs vastly amongst the provinces and territories of Canada. Given the small sample size for some provinces, statistical significance of outcome disparities between provinces could not be determined reliably in advanced analysis. Similarly, differences may exist between hospitals in both the quality and organization of care regardless of volume. Multi-\u00ad\u2010level analysis was used to account for the differences between provinces (i.e. health care structure, policies, population health status) and hospitals on outcomes of care. Advanced survival analysis was performed to assess the impact of factors of interest on hospital length of stay. Where pertinent, provincial outcomes are reported compared to their peers although this was only possible with Ontario. As Ontario is the most populous province with a sufficient sample size, its results were compared with the rest of Canada in multivariate analysis in order to benchmark outcomes to a larger population by evaluating the deviations of outcomes in the province relative to the larger national mean. P a g e | 156 \u2022 The analysis of travel times and evolution of hospital catchment areas was completed using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods utilizing ArcGIS software and Census Canada data. GIS is a uniquely integrative mix of hardware, software, and practices that enable spatial epidemiology \u2013 the geo-\u00ad\u2010visualization of the distribution and determinants of health phenomena. GIS can assist in identifying the distribution of health events and health services, and allows the application of a spatial lens to the complex relationships between resources, procedure volumes, and outcomes. This technique allows us to descriptively map and analyze the distribution and trends of cancer surgery while stratified for institutional volume. Travel time was calculated using the first three digits of de-\u00ad\u2010identified patient postal codes relative to the nearest surgical institution, adjusted for road network data such as speed limits, bodies of water and traffic lights. This work has resulted in figures that visually describe differences in health care delivery at 2004-\u00ad\u20102007and 2011-\u00ad\u20102012 cohorts. \u2022 Age-\u00ad\u2010standardized resection rates were calculated using 1991 Canadian population as a standard. The rates were presented as aggregated sum of number of surgeries in the first and last three years, divided by the adjusted provincial populations in the middle years (2005 and 2011, respectively) for each time period. The denominator, adjusted provincial populations in 2005 and 2011, were multiplied by 3 in order to obtain rates per person-\u00ad\u2010 years. For instance, the aggregated 3-\u00ad\u2010year resection rate for first 3 years was calculated as: Aggregated 3-\u00ad\u2010year Resection Rate= (Number of Surgeries from 2004-\u00ad\u20102006) x 100,000 (Age-\u00ad\u2010adjusted Provincial Population in 2005) x 3 \u2022 Potential Years of Life Lost calculated using method described by Urbach et al.33 Potential number of hospital days were calculated using unadjusted median for the highest hospital volume category.

Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island). These locations were purposefully selected to reflect different degrees of regionalization for complex cancer surgeries and access to surgical centres of excellence. In particular, there have been active efforts in Ontario to regionalize some complex cancer surgeries, the creation of surgical centres of excellence and the development of guidelines about minimum-\u00ad\u2010volume standards for surgical sites and surgeons by Cancer Care Ontario. In Alberta, there has been a passive form of regionalization for some surgical procedures over the years. The transition took place in large part because surgeons preferred to provide care in a team setting rather than on their own. In contrast, very few complex cancer surgeries have been performed in Prince Edward Island (PEI) over the last 9 years, and patients must travel to a neighbouring-\u00ad\u2010province to access complex cancer surgeries (most often Nova Scotia). Each panel consisted of a one-\u00ad\u2010day structured deliberation facilitated by a member of the research team and included deliberations about the problem, three options to address the problem, and implementation considerations. The brief, which was circulated one week prior to each panel, was taken as read for each panel, allowing the deliberations to build on the pre-\u00ad\u2010circulated material to generate rich insights from panel members. The citizen panels did not aim for consensus. However, it aimed to highlight areas of common ground and differences of opinion among panel members and (where possible) identify the values underlying different positions. The study protocol was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board at McMaster University and all panel members provided voluntary, informed consent. For those who are interested in obtaining more information about the citizen brief, it is freely available on the McMaster Health Forum website (www.mcmasterhealthforum.org). Preparing the citizen brief We prepared the citizen brief through four main steps. First, we convened a steering committee comprised of representatives from the McMaster Health Forum, as well as clinicians and researchers from McMaster University who were involved in a broader program of research about complex cancer surgeries. The role of the steering committee was to provide guidance and expert advice across all stages of the process. Second, in collaboration with the steering committee, we developed terms of reference for the citizen brief, which provided a preliminary outline of the framing of the problem, three options for addressing it, and implementation considerations (i.e., barriers and facilitators for moving forward). We then conducted ten key informant interviews with policymakers, managers (e.g., from health regions and healthcare institutions), stakeholders (e.g., from provider associations or cancer societies) and researchers who were actively engaged in the issue of complex cancer surgeries. The terms of reference were iteratively revised based on feedback from the key informants and the steering committee and then used to structure the writing of the citizen brief. Third, we identified, selected, appraised and synthesized relevant research evidence about the problem, three options (among many) to address it, and implementation considerations. Whenever possible, we summarized research evidence drawn from systematic reviews and occasionally from P a g e | 168 single studies when reviews were not identified. We identified published literature that provided an understanding of the problem by searching PubMed to identify published literature. In addition, we searched for grey literature about the problem by reviewing the websites of a number of Canadian and international organizations. To identify research evidence about the three options in the brief, we searched Health Systems Evidence (www.healthsystemsevidence.org), which is a continuously updated database that now contains more than 4,000 systematic reviews of delivery, financial and governance arrangements within health systems. The reviews were identified by searching the database for \u2018cancer\u2019 and \u2018surgery\u2019 in the title and abstract, and by searching topic categories addressing features of each of the options (e.g., \u2018quality monitoring and improvement systems\u2019 and \u2018regionalization\u2019). The searches were reviewed for relevance by the lead author of the brief (FPG). Fourth, we synthesized key findings in the form of a citizen brief. Specifically, we drafted the brief in such a way as to present concisely and in accessible language the research evidence. The final version of the brief consisted of a description of: 1) the context for the panel; 2) the problem; 3) three options (among many) to address it; 4) implementation considerations; and 5) the questions to be discussed during the citizen panels. The brief also contained a separate insert for each panel, which described particular features of the local health system. We then undertook a merit review process for the brief, which was reviewed by one public/patient representative, one policymaker, one stakeholder, and one researcher in order to ensure its system relevance, its scientific rigour and its accessibility. Convening the citizen panels We worked collaboratively with the steering committee to plan and convene the three citizen panels. Two strategies were implemented to recruit potential candidates: 1) targeted invitations sent to the AskingCanadiansTM panel (a market-\u00ad\u2010research panel of more than 600,000 Canadians who have opted-\u00ad\u2010in to participate in online surveys); and 2) targeted online advertisements via cancer organizations and societies. We selected 10-\u00ad\u201014 panel members for each panel based on explicit criteria (e.g., experiences as patients or informal/family caregivers, experiences with cancer and surgeries, types of cancer, gender, socioeconomic and ethno-\u00ad\u2010cultural background). We describe the profile of panel members for each panel in Appendix 9. The study protocol was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board at McMaster University and all panel members provided voluntary, informed consent. Each panel consisted of a one-\u00ad\u2010day structured deliberation facilitated by a member of the research team (JA or FPG) and included deliberations about the problem, three options to address the problem, and implementation considerations. The brief, which was circulated one week prior to each panel, was taken as read for each panel, allowing the deliberations to build on the pre-\u00ad\u2010 circulated material to generate rich insights from panel members. The citizen panels did not aim for consensus. However, it aimed to highlight areas of common ground and differences of opinion among panel members and (where possible) identify the values underlying different positions.\nP a g e | 169 Appendix 7: Features of the problem of delivering complex cancer surgeries as described in the citizen brief Issue Factors contributing to the issue Cancer represents a significant burden on individuals, the health system and society \u2022 With population growth and aging, the number of new cases of cancer in Canada is expected to increase. \u2022 Since surgery is the primary treatment option for certain high-\u00ad\u2010risk cancers, the costs associated with cancer surgeries are expected to rise over time. Patients in need of complex cancer surgeries and their families face a difficult journey \u2022 Patients and families have to make complex and potentially life-\u00ad\u2010changing decisions (e.g., undergoing surgery or not, undergoing surgery at a local low-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital or travelling to a high-\u00ad\u2010volume hospital with the hope of better outcomes), but information to guide such decisions is often not readily available. \u2022 The long-\u00ad\u2010term outlook for those diagnosed with any of these five types of cancer is generally quite intimidating, since a significant number of patients will die despite curative-\u00ad\u2010intent surgery. The health system is not currently designed to provide optimal care for such patients \u2022 Delivery arrangements o There are disparities in access to complex cancer surgeries across Canada and even in settings that have access there are disparities in the availability of expertise to conduct these surgeries. In some provinces, the surgeries are being delivered in any hospital setting, without restriction. There have been efforts to regionalize (or centralize) some of these complex cancer surgeries into high-\u00ad\u2010volume centres (i.e., centres providing surgical care to many patients) in a few provinces. o There is a lack of support for the informal and family caregivers of the patients undergoing complex cancer surgery. \u2022 Financial arrangements o The predominant funding model for Canadian hospitals (i.e., global budgets) provides little incentive for hospitals to focus on increasing surgery volumes, improving quality of care, or coordinating care across facilities and sectors. \u2022 Governance arrangements o There is minimal regulation as to which procedures surgeons can perform within their specialty area, or how frequently they need to perform these procedures to ensure their surgical skills remain up to date. o There is minimal regulation as to which procedures can be performed in hospitals or how frequently they need to perform them to ensure that quality remains high. In addition, most hospitals are regulated by legislation that establishes an appeal process for doctors who feel aggrieved by decisions made by hospital boards, which can make it difficult to change where different types of surgical procedures can be performed. o There is a lack of coordinated effort among all stakeholders to improve complex cancer surgeries across the country (e.g., no agreed set of quality indicators at the pan-\u00ad\u2010Canadian level). P a g e | 170 Appendix 8: Three options for improving the delivery of complex cancer surgeries in Canada Option Option focus and elements 1 -\u00ad\u2010 Encourage the local adoption of quality-\u00ad\u2010 improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided \u2022 The first option aims to encourage healthcare providers (e.g., surgeons, nurses and others) and managers to adopt quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives in local hospitals in order to improve the delivery of high-\u00ad\u2010risk and resource-\u00ad\u2010intensive cancer surgeries. This option assumes that healthcare providers and hospital managers will adopt quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives without the need for supports, incentives or directives to change behaviour, and without the need for regulatory changes about where (and by whom) these cancer surgeries can be provided. In sum, this option proposes a locally driven approach to improve the delivery of cancer surgeries. \u2022 There are a large number of quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement strategies that can be driven locally by healthcare providers and hospital managers, for example: o Promoting audit and feedback; o Promoting the use of clinical decision support systems; o Promoting continuing medical education; and o Implementing enhanced recovery programs. 2 -\u00ad\u2010 Implement province-\u00ad\u2010wide quality-\u00ad\u2010 improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries where they are now being provided \u2022 The second option aims to implement province-\u00ad\u2010wide* quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives to improve the delivery of complex cancer surgeries. Like the first option, this option is not intended to change where and by whom these cancer surgeries are being provided. However, in contrast to the first option, this option proposes a top-\u00ad\u2010down approach to quality improvement and assumes that healthcare providers and hospital managers can achieve significant improvements, but that they need appropriate support, incentives and directives to do this. \u2022 These province-\u00ad\u2010wide quality-\u00ad\u2010improvement initiatives could take different forms, for example: o Developing provincial guidelines and standards for these cancer surgeries; o Implementing pay-\u00ad\u2010for-\u00ad\u2010performance for hospitals; o Developing or expanding supports for patients and families; and o Establishing requirements for reporting to the public about quality indicators and other performance measures. 3 \u2013 Regionalize complex cancer surgeries into designated surgical centres of excellence \u2022 The third option aims to regionalize complex cancer surgeries into designated surgical centres of excellence. This option includes efforts to change the structure of the health system and to set province-\u00ad\u2010wide standards to support the regionalization of complex cancer surgeries. This option assumes that changes to who performs the surgeries and where they are performed will be needed to improve the delivery of care. This option proposes a top-\u00ad\u2010down, province-\u00ad\u2010wide approach to design and implement changes to who does what and where across the province. As with option 2, this option can include developing or expanding supports for patients and families. * For small provinces, province-\u00ad\u2010wide should be taken to mean across the small province or across both the small province and a neighbouring, larger province to which referrals are frequently made.
